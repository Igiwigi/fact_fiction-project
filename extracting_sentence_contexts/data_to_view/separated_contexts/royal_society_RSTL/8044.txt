These bands are now very generally admitted to repre-
Szent disks composed of two entirely distinct 8ubstances, arranged in successlve 8eries
Swith their planes at right angles to the axis of the fibre; and I shall, for convenience
Sof description, adhere for the present to this notion, although, as I shall afterwards

Z endeavour to show, the difference in appearance which they present, may be accounted
a for otherwise than by regarding them as composed of different materials. To proceed with my description. Each disk of dim substance appears pervaded
throughout by a number of excessively fine rod-shaped particles of uniform diameter,
and rather darker in appearance than the substance of the disk which they traverse.
'These particles are arranged closely and very regularly, with their axes in a direction
more or less parallel to that of the fibre; they extend at either end into the neigh-
bouring disks of bright substance, becoming somewhat less distinct as they pass

* T use the word © dim ” because, in fact, in living muscle at rest no such thing as a dark stripe occurs ;
one part is only 8omewhat less bright than the other. MDCCCLXXIIL. 3M
