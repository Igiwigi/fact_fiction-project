The contribution by Beals et al. (2007) deals with aspects relating the string
density problem to the integrability of the CH equation, while E] Dika & Molinet
(2007) analyses the stability of multi-soliton solutions to the CH equation. Finally, the paper by Kolev (2007) discusses the connection between the CH
equation and the geodesic flow on the diffeomorphism group of the circle. This
geometric aspect is deeply connected with the fact that the least action principle
1olds for the CH equation (cf. Constantin & Kolev 2003) and explains from a
geometric perspective the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the equation. The paper by Johnson (2007) presents a field survey of edge waves and offers
several ideas about future directions for research on these intriguing water
waves.
