(as in (1.1) and for the same reasons, we have replaced v; by zero in (5.1b) to simplify the
exposition). For simplicity, we will assume periodic boundary conditions in the x-direction:

u(-L,y,t) =u(L,y,t) and v(-L,y,t) = v(L,y, 4),

with the stripe extending to infinity in the y-direction (y € R). Mathematical models of vegetation
patterns have a long history, starting with the work by Lefever and Lejeune on Tiger Bush
patterns, [10]. The link between localized vegetation spots and localized structures was
established in [11]. Vegetation spots can also be unstable through self-replication [12]. The
particular model (5.1) that we chose is a variant of the Klausmeier vegetation model [13]. There,
v represents water concentration in the soil whereas u is the plant density. In addition to the
usual diffusion (assumed to be isotropic here for simplicity), the water flows down the slope.
This is represented by the cv; term (positive c assumes the water flows from right to left). In fact
equations (5.1) are special case of Klausmeier model when water evaporation is assumed small
(water evaporation is modelled by adding —ev term to the right-hand side of (5.1b)).

There are numerous papers studying the transition between homogeneous vegetation,
vegetation spots and vegetation stripes, as well as self-replication. For a very incomplete list of
references, see for example [4,14—22] and references therein. Generally speaking, spots transition
to stripes, and stripes to uniform state, when precipitation rate A is increased.

Here, we show the transition of spots to stripes analytically in the regime of large slope
(represented by parameter c) and small diffusion d. The stripes extend in the y-direction, so
that they are perpendicular to the slope. The existence of stable stripes for large c was observed
numerically in [4,20], matching observations in nature [23,24]. By contrast, in [4] the authors show
