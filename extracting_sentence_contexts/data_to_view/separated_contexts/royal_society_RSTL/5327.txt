*V is supposed to be taken as the first divisor,, and the term Tesidueyis used, as hitherto in this paper,
throughout in the sense appertaining to the expansion conducted, 80 as to lead to an improper continued
fraction, in that senze, in fact, in which it would, more strictly speaking, be entitled to the appellation of excess
rather than that of residue.
