The
framework is a maximum entropy approach just like the Potts model approach from [19], except
that Berg and von Hippel assumed that every single nucleotide in the binding site is at maximum
entropy. The score that each sequence is assigned is an energy score, where the consensus sequence
of the MSA for that site has zero energy (the ‘ground state’). In fact, the energy score of a DNA
binding site is given by an energy functional that is precisely of the form (3.1), but without the
second-order term (as correlations between sites are considered not to be important in DNA
binding). Unlike in the Potts-model approach, the counterparts to h;(s;) are not fitted to the MSA in the
BvH approach. Rather, they are directly extracted from the MSA in terms of a matrix as?

(3.9)

because this is the expression that maximizes the single-site entropy (subject to constraints).
