Secondly, We may imagine that the five pairs of minute rudimental legs of the
future Crab are not transformed from the two pairs of natatory limbs, but are totally

unconnected with them, being, as Mr. Tnomesox himself says, © disengaged from
beneath the clypeus”, (and his Plate IT. fig. 2. represents the same idea,) and having
no previous existence in the young Zoe. Now if this be the case, setting aside its
disagreement with the recognised conditions of development, we arrive at once at
this startling and important conelusion, namely, that the large natatory organs of
the Zoe are instrumenta cibaria, foot-jaws, in fact, and that the animal in its Zoe
state has no true legs. Without, however, asserting (which might reasonably be
done) that every annulose animal which in its immature state is furnished with loco-
motive organs, is also furnished with instrumenta ecibaria, which latter legitimately
represent the instrumenta cibaria of the imago, whilst the former as truly represent
the true legs of the imago, we may assert, that where an immature annulose animal
is furnished with locomotive organs, these, or at least some of them, represent the
true thoracic legs of the imago, and are not, in such immature state, merely rudi-
mental trophi of the perfect animal. Now on applying this principle to the case in
question, we find the Zoe furnished both with trophi and natatory organs ; and if we
regard the trophi, although few in number, as representatives of the trophi, and the
two pairs of natatory organs as representatives of the locomotive organs of the fature
Crab, we can only regard the five pairs of disengaged limbs either as representing
