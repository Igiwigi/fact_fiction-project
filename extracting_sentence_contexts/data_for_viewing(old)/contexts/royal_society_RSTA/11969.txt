approaches with a close degree of approximation to the well-known error or egiiet i
curve. A frequency-curve, which, for practical purposes, can be represented by the
error curve, will for the remainder of this paper be termed a normal curve. When a
series of measurements gives rise to a normal curve, we may probably assume
something approaching a stable condition; there is production and destruction
impartially round the mean. In the case of certain biological, sociological, and
economic â€œmeasurements there is, however, a well-marked deviation from this
normal shape, and it becomes important to determine the direction and amount of
such deviation. The asymmetry may arise from the fact that the units grouped
together in the measured material are not really homogeneous. It may happen that
we have a mixture of 2, 3,... homogeneous groups, each of which deviates about
its own mean symmetrically and in a manner represented with sufficient accuracy by
the normal curve. Thus an abnormal frequency-curve may be really built up of normal
curves having parallel but not necessarily coincident axes and different parameters.
Even where the material is really homogeneous, but gives an abnormal frequency-curve
the amount and direction of the abnormality will be indicated if this frequency-curve
can be split up into normal curves. The object of the present paper is to discuss the
dissection of abnormal frequency-curves into normal curves. The equations for the
dissection of a frequency-curve into n normal curves can be written down in the same
manner as for the special case of n = 2 treated in this paper ; they require us only to
calculate higher moments. But the analytical difficulties, even for the case of n = 2,
