sarcomata at the site of injection. Again, the tumours of the liver due to aminostilbenes are
almost invariably cholangiomatous, and less malignant than the liver tumours brought
about by 2-acetamidofluorene, while the mammary tumours evoked by the former
substances are practically always simple, in contrast with the malignant breast tumours due
to acetamidofluorene. If part of these differences may conceivably be due to strain
differences in the animals used—and it has been shown both by Bielschowsky (1946) and
Harris (1947) that this factor may greatly affect the type of tumours induced by acet-
amidofluorene—another part is no doubt due to the inherent differences of these two
chemical types. Even so it is remarkable that the highly individual and characteristic
squamous cell carcinoma arising in the external acoustic duct, should have been reported
only in association with administration of 2-acetamidofluorene, of 2-anthramine, or of
the aminostilbenes, and so far not at all as occurring spontaneously. Taken together, these
facts suggest some significant relationship between 4-aminostilbene and 2-aminofluorene,
perhaps similar to that between the carcinogenic 2:2'-azonaphthalene and 3:4:5:6-
dibenzcarbazole (Cook, Hewett, Kennaway & Kennaway 1940).

It is interesting to compare the action of 4-dimethylaminostilbene with that of the
isosteric 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (‘butter yellow’, dimethyl yellow), which induces
liver cancer in the rat (Kinosita 1937). Jacobi & Baumann (1942) suggested that the
protection afforded by high protein and high riboflavin diets against butter-yellow carcino-
genesis was partly due to the demethylation of the dye to 4-aminoazobenzene, stated by
Kinosita to be non-carcinogenic. Kirby (1944, see also 1945), was, however, able to show
that the methyl groups in butter yellow are not strictly essential for carcinogenesis. While
preliminary evidence has been obtained (by Dr L. A. Elson) that dealkylation of 4-di-
methylaminostilbene proceeds to a certain degree, it is apparent from tables 14 and 15 that
