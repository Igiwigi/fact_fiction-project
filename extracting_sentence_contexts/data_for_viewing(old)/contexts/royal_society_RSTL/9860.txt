reproductive organs in a more perfect state will alone enable us to arrive at a ps
satisfactory conclusion on this point.

Along with the examples described are numerous single spheres about 0012 in
diameter. It was long doubtful whether or not these lapel to the supposed
Peronosporites, but T have now no doubt as to their doing 80, Their diameter is about
the same as that of the oogonia, of the branching specimens, and I found one in a_small
cluster of these objects which had developed into the state corresponding to that
represented by fig. 37.

T have occasionally found long branching hyphe without any‚Äù dilatations, and which,
being associated with the branching ones, I presume belong to the same plant, since
they differ in no respect from the shorter hyphz of the latter. From these facts it
would appear that this organism began as a single spore-like cell within the cells and
vessels of other plants. This cell threw ont from one to three short hyphe, each of
which developed a capsule like an oogonium at its extremity, which, in turn, repeated
the same process until a complex branching structure was produced. But under some
other cireumstances longer branching hyphee, either devoid of oogonia or only bearing
them at much longer intervals, were produced.

In conelusion I have again to thank Mr. Casx and Mr. Serxces, of Halifax, and
Mr. Jonx Arrxex, of Urmston, near Manchester, for the free access they have given
me to their cabinets, and to Mr. BurrerworTn, Mr. Youxc, F.G.S. of London, and
