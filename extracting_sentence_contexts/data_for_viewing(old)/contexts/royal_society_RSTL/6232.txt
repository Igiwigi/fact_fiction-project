port, I deem it of interest to record the above cireumstances, to correct a misapprehension
as to the employment of long needles, carried, in the compasses of the Great Fastern,
to the extent of 11 inches for standard and steering, and 16 inches for the mast-compass.
A series of experiments, still in progress, which I have instituted in elucidation of the
comparative errors due to the use of long and short needles, both where the disturbing
cause is comparatively close to the compass, as in the case of the rudder-head near the
steering compass, or the top sides and iron beams when heeling, and in compensated
compasses from the necessary proximity of bar magnets, lead to the conclusion that no
compass-needle should exceed in length, for service in an iron hip, 6 or 7 inches; the
card of course may be enlarged as practically convenient.

The errors of long needles, under the conditions just named, of proximity to perma-
nent magnetic bodies, arise from this notable fact, that their deviations assume the form,
not of a curye which is simply © semicircular,” as the curve is found to be which results
from the ship's general magnetic force when the length of the needle may be relatively
considered as infinitesimally small, but of a © sextantal ” superposed on a *© semicircular ”
curve, the various maxima of the © sextantal ” curye increasing with the square of the
length of the needle. As8uming the zero of both curves (the semicircular and sextantal)
to be at the magnetic North and South, the maxima of the sextantal deviations (by
ship's compass) are respectively at about N. 30? E., East, S. 30* K., S. 309 W., West,
N 30* W., the points of coincidence with the semicircular curve being at North, N. 60* E.,
S. 60? E., South, S. 607 W., and N. 60* W.]

The tendency of the direction of the ship's force in the Great Fastern is to asxume
a fore-and-aft line, supporting the view, that time, with the vibrations and concussions
