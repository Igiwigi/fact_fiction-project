to examine whether, and how, these can be satisfied by values of «’, 6’, and y’.
Since there must, from general physical principles, be an equation of some sort for
points of bifurcation (whether capable of being satisfied by real values or not), we
are led to suspect that these four equations are not really independent.

Equation (79) was obtained by the elimination of « from two equations (65) and
(74), each of which expressed in effect the condition that the centre of gravity
of the mass should be at the origin; in fact, equation (65) was only a short way
of arriving at the value of «, which would in any case have been given by equa-
tion (74). We therefore expect that equation (79), derived from (65) and (74),
will prove only to be an identity of which the truth is involved in the three other
equations (76) to (78). And, as a matter of procedure which is entirely at our
choice, we shall elect first to solve equations (76) to (78), and then to verify the
truth of (79).

The elimination of «’, f’, y/ from equations (76), (77), and (78) gives a determinant
which on expansion reduces to
