To apply the Wiener—-Hopf technique, we proceed in the standard manner by first Fourier
transforming in the x variable:

‘co .
G(an=| oye de. (26)
—00
Imposing decay as |y| — 00, we find that the x-Fourier transform ®(a,y) of a solution ¢(x,y)
satisfying the governing equation (2.2) along (—0o, 00) may be written

H(a,y) =sgn(y) O(a, 0+)e 7, (2.7)

where y(a@) = Va? — k’, having used the fact that the scattered field ¢ is anti-symmetric in y. The
branch cuts are taken to be the rays {a = +k + is: 0 <s < ov} parallel to the imaginary axis. We
note from the form of this solution (2.7) that

'(a,0+) + y(a)&(a, 0+) =0, (2.8)

where 0! = a This equation relates integral transforms of boundary values, as may be

generically found for separable equations by constructing the global relation [41]. To formulate
a Wiener-Hopf problem, we view this equation as describing jump problem between analytic
functions, as described in the next section.

To recover the physical scattered field ¢(x, y) from (a, y), we invert the x-Fourier transform
