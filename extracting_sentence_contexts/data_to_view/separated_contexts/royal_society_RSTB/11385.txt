blem in extracting the study of movement from the study of
the city more generally is that our theories about cities are
not well-formed and often confusedâ€”there is a science in
the making but this is rudimentary [7]. We thus have to cur-
tail our discussion of certain aspects of movement due to the
fact that we are not able to discuss dynamics and equilibrium
in great detail or questions about the evolution of cities and
their complexity. Nevertheless, we will provide a rounded
enough review to hopefully engage the reader in some of
the key questions. The current changes in our thinking about what is hap-
pening with respect to the study of location and movement
in cities arises from many issues.
