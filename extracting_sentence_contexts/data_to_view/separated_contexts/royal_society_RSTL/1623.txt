4. Some general Observalions. It is a fact worthy of notice, that phosphoric and sulphuric
acids should contain the same quantity of oxygene to the same
quantity of inflammable matter; and yet that the oxygene should
be combined in them, with such different degrees of affinity. Phosphorous acid has a great tendency to unite with oxygene,
and absorbs it even from water : and sulphureous acid can only
retain it when water is present. The relation of water to the composition of many bodies has
already occupied the attention of some distinguished chemists,
and is well worthy of being further studied ; most of the sub-
stances obtained by precipitation from aqueous solutions are, I
find, compounds of water.
