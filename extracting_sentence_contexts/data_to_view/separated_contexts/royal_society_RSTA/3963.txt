From a theoretical point of view, we have classified the conditions for
the controlled enhancement or slowing down of the convection in the case where all species
have the same diffusion coefficients [76,85]. In short, the reaction is stabilizing when the product
is less dense than the reactants, as shown experimentally in the case of an ester dissolving in
an aqueous solution of NaOH [78]. The local decrease of density induced by the fact that the
product is less dense creates a non-monotonic density profile [71,76,78,85,86] with a minimum
that blocks the further progression of the fingers in the bulk of the host phase. On the contrary,
a destabilizing effect can be obtained when the product has a sufficiently larger contribution to
density than both reactants. We have experimentally demonstrated this case for dissolution of
gaseous CO} into aqueous solutions of hydroxide bases (figure 6) [53,76].
