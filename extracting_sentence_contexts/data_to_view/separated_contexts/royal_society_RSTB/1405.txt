Among the vascular Cryptogams, Spheng
must rank as one of the most highly organized geneva, on account both of the
histological complexity of its vegetative organs, and of the peculiar morpholo
fructification. However we may interpret the latter, it certainly has
specialized character. In fact Sphenophyllum affords yet another exam
Carboniferous Cryptogam, which, so far from representing a primitive type, is inna:
ways more elaborately modified than any recent forms. It is not surprising that the most various systematic positions have been asy
to the genus by different authors. For example, ScHENK, VAN TIEGH
others, have placed it near Lycopodiaceee ; STUR refers it to Calamariex, B
to Salviniacese, while ZeruLER has recently traced a relationship, on the one
Marsiliacess, and on the other to Ophioglossew.
