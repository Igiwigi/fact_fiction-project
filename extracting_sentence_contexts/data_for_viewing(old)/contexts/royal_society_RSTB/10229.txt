available to identify organisms within particular groups,
they are often misinterpreted, incomplete or employed by
users with limited training. While programmes are in place
to provide quality assurance for identification for many pur-
poses, these are not consistently employed to any significant
degree in field-based research. Moreover, few standards exist
in terms of how samples should be processed. When
researchers state that organisms in the sample were identified
to a specified taxonomic level (e.g. genus or species), what
they generally mean is these organisms were identified to
the best of our ability, based on the assumption that the
keys available covered all the material being processed. More-
over, the fact that many organisms cannot be identified
beyond a much higher taxonomic level (e.g. order) may be
recorded, but often is not even mentioned. The consequence
is that within certain areas of research, we have become comfor-
table with a technique that provides incomplete information.
Orlofske & Baird [18] highlighted this problem of taxono-
mic sufficiency in relation to river benthos by showing that in
a typical benthic sample collected in an area where familiarity
with the local fauna was good, it was not possible to confidently
identify more than 50% of the larval specimens of four com-
monly occurring insect orders to genus level. This was due to
the presence of many early larval-stage specimens which
lacked the distinguishable characters necessary for genus-level
