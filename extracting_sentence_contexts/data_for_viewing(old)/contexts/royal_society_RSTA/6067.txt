the decreasing trend of the effective viscosity with decreasing the oil volume-fraction in the
right branch (¢ > 70%) could be due to the fact that the relatively large density difference
between oil and water used in these experiments affects the distribution of the two liquids in
the system. For the purpose of detailed investigation of the phase inversion, the dispersed oil (or
water) phase was gradually injected into the system to quasi-statically increase the oil (or water)
fraction, during which the instantaneous value of oil volume-fraction was calculated based on
the assumption of injection of liquid into a homogeneously mixed emulsion. The catastrophic
phase inversion was observed for both the cases of d¢p/dt > 0 (red lines, at ¢o = 72%) and the
cases of doo /dt <0 (blue lines, at ¢o = 52%), where the drag of the system experiences a sharp
jump (around 35% in torque). Therefore, an ambivalence region 52% < $9 < 72% is found in the
emulsion system (see the shaded blue band in figure 4b), which means both O/W and W/O
states can exist in this fraction range, and the state of the flow is determined by its current
volume-fraction and its history. This opens possibilities for drag reduction for the transport
of emulsions by actively controlling the emulsion state, which has applications in oil recovery
