constant at all temperatures.

For facility of reference some parts of the hydrogen curves given both in fig. 2 and
fig. 3 (Plate 18), and the curve representing the emissivity in air at three atmospheres,
will be found again in fig. 4 (Plate 19).

506 MR. J. E. PETAVEL ON THE HEAT DISSIPATED BY

The emissivity in steam at atmospheric pressure is given in fig. 5. The slope of
the curve is much sharper than for any of the gases previously studied. This fact, as
we shall see from the results given below, cannot be entirely accounted for by the
higher temperature of the enclosure.

I hope shortly to undertake a research on the emissivity of platinum in gases at a
much higher pressure. For the present the results are too incomplete to allow any
general theory to be formulated. ‘

The values obtained for the emissivity are to some extent dependent on experi-
mental conditions, such as the diameter of the radiating wire, its position in space
(whether horizontal cr vertical), the dimensions of the enclosure, its absolute tempera-
ture, and the material of which it is made. For the results to be of any general
application, it is necessary to form an idea of the extent to which they are affected
