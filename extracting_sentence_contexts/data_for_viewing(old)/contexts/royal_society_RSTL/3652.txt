Society, are to be 80 regarded, —those communications having reference to the mode
of propagation of the floating blood-corpuscle, and to its conversion into two or three
kinds of tissnes.

The object of the present memoir is to bring together a large number of obserya-
tions, made by myself, showing that every structure I have examined arises out, of
corpuscles having the same appearance as corpuscles of the blood. I may here
mention, that the tissues submitted to actual observation, with the result just men-
tioned, will be found to include the cellular, nervous, and muscular ; besides carti-
lage, the coats of blood-vessels, several membranes, the tables, cells, and cylinders of
the epithelium, the pigmentum nigrum, the ciliary processes, the crystalline lens itself,
and even the spermatozoon and the ovum. And among the yast number of observa-
tions made, I have not been able, with the greatest care, to detect a single fact
inconsistent with the conclusion above announced. If that conclusion—which
regards the formation of the tissues— be correct, it may, I think, assist us in consi-
dering © the mode in which the floating corpuscles of the blood conduce to nourish-
ment” during life.

For the detail of these observations, I shall rely principally upon the drawings, and
the minute explanation of them separately given. 'The perusal of that explanation
will, I conceive, be necessary for the understanding of some general remarks I shall
