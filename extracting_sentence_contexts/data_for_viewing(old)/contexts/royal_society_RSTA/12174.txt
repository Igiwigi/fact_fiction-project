8 73. On the present theory, magnetic force or rather magnetic induction consists in
E a permeation or flow of the primordial medium through the vortex-aggregate which
g constitutes the matter; apparently it has not been tried (see however § 81) whether
© light-waves are carried on by this motion of the medium and their effective velocity
5 is thereby altered, as we would be led to expect. It has been shown, however, by
= Witeerrorcet that the velocity of light is not sensibly altered by motion along a
29 field of electric displacement, so far negativing any theory that would connect electric
3 ‘displacement with considerable bodily velocity of the ether; and it has also been
‘8 verified, by Lord RaviricH, that the transfer of an electric current across an electro-
S lyte does not affect the velocity of light in it.
8 As motion of the wether represents magnetic force, the fact that the magnetic
i permeability is almost the same in all sensibly non-magnetic bodies as in a vacuum
= must be taken to indicate that the sether flows with practically its full velocity in all
é such media, so that there is very little obstruction interposed by the matter; it
+= follows that, in the motion of a body through the ether, the outside sther remains
g at rest instead of flowing round its sides. The sther we thus assume to be at rest
*g in any region, except it be a field of magnetic force, even though masses are moving
= through the region; so that the coefficient of Fresnet, which is null for free sether
HE and very small for but slightly ponderable media, would represent simply a change of
A Velocity due to slight unilateral change of effective elasticity somehow produced by
the motion through the quiescent medium of the vortices constituting the matter.

through a porous medium containing obstacles to its motion has been shown by Lord
