easily ruptured protoplasmic prolongation. They do not, however, entirely fill the
cavity of the gonophore ; and the narrow intervals between them, as well as the small
pace which separates them from the walls of the gonophore, is occupied by a matter
which appears to consist chiefly of free nuclei and of dwindled and degraded ova, all
apparently undergoing a process of liquefaction, and doubtless an unused residuum of
the bodies by the coalescence of which the compound masses had been formed.

If in this stage the gonophore be laid open, and the protoplasm masses, whose forma-
tion we have been tracing, be liberated under the microscope, we shall often sueceed
in witnessing very minute bristle-like processes of clear protoplasgm which have become
developed over their surface (fig. 11). 'These little processes, however, are not permanent
structures, and they will often become entirely withdrawn while the object is under
examination. They are, in fact, true pseudopodia, and are probably employed in the
nutrition of the masses from which they arise.

'The contents of the gonophore, however, are intended to undergo further changes
before the period of their liberation has arrived. 'The separate protoplasgm masses
increase in size, the residual matter which had surrounded them disappears, having
probably afforded material for their nutrition ; they begin to coalesce with one another,
and there is ultimately formed a single large plasmodium, which entirely fills the cavity
of the gonophore. When this plasmodium is examined under the compressor, the same
nucleolated nuclei which had hitherto characterized the products of the coalescence of
the ova are 8een to be scattered in great numbers through its substance (fig. 13).
These nuclei, however, have already begun to suffer a change; for while in some the
nucleolus is still distinet, in others it has quite disappeared ; and while in some the con-
