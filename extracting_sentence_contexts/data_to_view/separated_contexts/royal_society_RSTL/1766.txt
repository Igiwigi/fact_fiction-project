As the quantity (in the foregoing experiment)
diminished in the alloy by the oxidating action of the positive
pole, the mercury, as we have seen, by degrees resumed its
original properties. The only effect that may appear obscure,
is the revulsion noticed in the direction of the currents when
the last portion of oxide disappears. It is, in fact, a pretty com-

plicated effect, but capable of easy explanation. The oxida-
tion takes place over the surface of the metal before the last
portions of sodium are removed. This is easily proved.
