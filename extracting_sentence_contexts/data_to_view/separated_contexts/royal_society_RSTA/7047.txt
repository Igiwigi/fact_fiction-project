Miscellaneous applications

For the purpose of corollary (18-3), H can be chosen as the symmetric group of all per-
mutations of the elements of G. Then the order of H is bounded in terms of that of G. More
important is the fact that H then depends on G only, not on A and B; that is, H serves
simultaneously for all pairs of isomorphic subgroups of G which one may wish to make
conjugate. This is also true for infinite groups G if one takes H to be, for example, the
unrestricted symmetric group of all permutations of the elements of K = GG’, where
G’ is isomorphic to G. This, and a little more, we also obtain from the following theorem:
