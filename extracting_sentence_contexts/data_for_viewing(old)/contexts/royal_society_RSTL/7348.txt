From 50* 14' 30” to 52? 44 W. long., we are till off the northern” edge of t
Newfoundland Bank ; and, though the depth decreases from 405 fathoms to 161
then to 112 fathoms, Foraminifera are extremely rare, owing, without doubt, chiefly t
the coldness of ice-laden water. Truncatulina, Pulvinulina, Polystomella, and Uvigeri
seem to struggle for existence here, where © Arctic” conditions are extended southwa

At 52* 56' and thence to 53* 57' 35” W, long. the line of soundings is in Trinity Bay
with depths varying from 124 to 195 fathoms. Only very scarce Globigerind, a t p
Pulvinuline, 80me Nonionine, rather more of the very persistent Cassiduline, and a v
few Uvigerine&, Buliminc&, and Lituole appear to inhabit this unfavourable locality
the depths examined. In fact this region belongs to the © Arctic Province,” which
here prolonged southwards towards the Bank of Newfoundland by the influence of
currents and icebergs. b

With the exception of the westerly soundings, these deep-sea gatherings from
