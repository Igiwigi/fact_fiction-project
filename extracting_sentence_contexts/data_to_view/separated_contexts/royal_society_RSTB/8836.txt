signalling during cell-cycle progression is controlled by cyclin robustness of the differentiated state, or the low differentiation
D proteins that activate CDK4/6 and lead to the phosphoryl- plasticity of neurons? One important clue is the fact that
ation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in their linker region. This p93 inhibition efficiently reprogrammes neurons to iPSCs as
mechanism blocks SMAD2/3 translocation into the nucleus in described above [91]. Also in fibroblasts, an increase in the
