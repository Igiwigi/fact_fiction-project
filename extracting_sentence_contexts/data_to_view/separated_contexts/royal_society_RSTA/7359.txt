In the other two planes also, many
of the experimental points can be connected by straight lines within the experimental
accuracy, as indicated, though the points referring to the subsidiary components which
cause the beats do not seem to fall on a linear plot. Departure from a linear plot suggests

non-vanishing cross-terms in the ellipsoid representation, and crystal symmetry would then
automatically require the ellipsoids to be in pairs, leading to pairs of values of, f of the type

oc (m, cos? y +m, sin? y+meg cos y sin f)}.

No scheme of this kind, however, can fit the facts in detail, since it would involve two periods
which become exactly equal for y= 0 or 47, while extrapolation suggests that the two periods
for the field nearly along the c-axis will not in fact become equal for the field exactly along
the c-axis. It should be noticed too that the experimentally determined value of E, for the
field along the c-axis and for the field along the a- or b-axes are quite different (see table 2),
so it is probable that the ellipsoids involved are unrelated by symmetry. The departure of
the points from the main straight line of figure 5 as the field turns nearly into the a-axis is
greater than can be ascribed to experimental error, and even though the E, values close to
the a- and b-axes are approximately equal, here too it is probable that independent ellip-
soids are involved.
