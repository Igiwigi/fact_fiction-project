It is the circumstance before alluded to of one part
of the hive being of a higher temperature than another. This is the case in the hive
even when the bees are not in a state of excitement. TI had been led to the observa-
tion of this fact during the winter when making experiments on the bees in a state
of excitement. Being anxious to know whether this was also the case in the spring
and 8ummer, I introduced another thermometer through the top of the straw hive, at
the same distance from the centre, but on the side opposite to the one previously in-
serted. This was on the evening of the 12th of May, when the temperature of the
atmosphere was 58* Fanun.
