The above symbols express, with regard to the first phase, I. e. g., that there are
five grinders on each side of the upper jaw, and four grinders on each side of the
under jaw : that those aboye answer to the second, third, and fourth deciduous molars,
and to the first and second permanent true molars; and that those below answer to
the third and fourth deciduous molars, and to the first and second true molars, —of
the typical dentition. With regard to the s8econd phase, the symbols express that
there are ix grinders on each side of the upper, and five grinders on each side of the
under jaw : those above answering to the second, third and fourth premolars, and to
the first, 8econd and third true molars; those below answering to the third and fourth
premolars, and the first, second and third true molars—of the typical dentition,

As to the fourth phase with four grinders on each side of both jaws, these answer,

in both, to the fourth premolar, and to the first, second and third true molars of the
typical dentition of the placental Diphyodonts. These explanations will serve to render the symbols of the remaining phases readily
understood by those who may not have studied the principles of dental notation
which I communicated to the © British Association* in 1848, and have more fully
exemplified in the article ©Teeth* of the © Cyclopzdia of Anatomy and Physiology ;
their utility will be obvious when they are found to express, in a few lines, facts in
Comparative Anatomy which would require almost as many pages if recounted by
ordinary description. This system of anatomical notation is the practical fruit of the discovery or deter-
mination of a type or common pattern of dentition to which the teeth of a certain
proportion of the Animal Kingdom could be referred, and of a concomitant attain-
ment of the power to trace a particular tooth under every modification and disguise
of 8ize and shape, throughout the different species of those animals. Every tooth,
thus capable of being individualized and determined, merits and, for the purposes
of description, requires to have a proper name, and can be signified by a symbol,
which is still more convenient for those purposes.
