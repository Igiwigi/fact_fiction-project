It may now well happen that though all the equations of condition found for the
general system are not satisfied, those associated with the new system are all satisfied,
so that the new system possesses a solution in normal form. If this is so, the original
system will be said to admit of a solution in subnormal form. In fact, an integer /
can always be found such that this is so, owing to the vanishing of the coefficients of
get fr = 0, 1...(4—2)}. In the first place, all the conditions arrived at from the equations X,, Y, ... will
be satisfied (p. 13), for the coefficient of 2” is identically zero; in general, the
left-hand members of X,, Y, ... are rational integral functions of the elements of the
matrices Aj, Ajp1, ---, Am-rii, if A, stands for the matrix multiplying 2”, and
contain no term independent of these elements. Now the conditions found on p. 13 arise from the equations X...X,-1, Yi.--Ye-a «++
and therefore involve the matrices A,,, ..., Ar-.+2
