There are, indeed, some phenomena of fluorescence, such as that of a nearly transparent
liquid becoming an object of some brightness by means of the property which it pos-
8esses of absorbing the nearly invisible rays of the spectrum, and dispersing them in a
degraded and much more luminous form, which are less obviously inconsistent with
cometary phenomena than are those of phosphorescence. The violent commotions and internal changes which we witness in comets when near
the 8uwn seem, however, to connect the great brightness which they then asxume more
closely with that part of the solar force we call heat. There is also to be considered
the fact of the polarized condition of the light of the tail and some parts of the come
of comets, which shows that a part of their light is reflected. The observations of the spectrum of Comet II. contained in this paper, which show
that its light was identical with that emitted by highly heated vapour of carbon, appear
to be almost decisive of the nature of cometary light. The great fixity of carbon seems
indeed to raise some difficulty in the way of accepting the apparently obvious inference
