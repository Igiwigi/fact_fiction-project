large scale is iron.t It appeared probable, therefore, that the local disturbances
were to be connected with the distribution of iron in the rocks, and accordingly the
origins of such disturbances were likely to be intimately related to the geological
structure of the district.

The subject was brought to the notice of the Council of the Royal Society by
Mr. Waker, and was referred by the Council to the Conjoint Board of Scientific
Societies, who appointed a Committee to consider the bearing of magnetic disturbances
on the possible occurrence of iron-ores.

+ The fact that there exist substances, as, for example, cobalt, nickel, and the Heusler alloys—CuAlMn
—that contain no iron and yet are, or can be rendered, strongly magnetic, has not been overlooked. It
has also been claimed that magnetism may be induced in certain minerals, such as kyanite AlSiO,,
dolomite CaMg(CO,)2, and leucite KAISiOs, but it has not been satisfactorily proved that in these latter
cases no trace of iron is present. In any case the susceptibilities of such mineral substances are small as
compared with those of materials containing an appreciable amount of iron, and are not sufficient to
excite the disturbances measured by Mr. WALKER. The whole results of this work go to show that the
disturbing element must be iron in some form or other.

If the magnetic disturbances were, as was reasonable to suppose, due to the local
