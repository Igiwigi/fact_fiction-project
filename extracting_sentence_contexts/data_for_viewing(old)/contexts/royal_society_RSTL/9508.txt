If we apply the same method to find the velocity potential for the motion of fluid
inside a sphere under the influence of a source inside, the integral becomes infinite
unless the s0urce is zero. The case is of course physically impossible since if fluid is
generated within the sphere it must pass through the boundary. But if we also place
an equal sink at any point within, the motion is then possible, and the expression
becomes finite. S being the source let S' be its inverse point with reference to the
sphere, and S” any point on the line S 8” produced to infinity. Then the © image” of

with finite derivatives, In fact, the potential at P will be

3. The expression found for the motion when there is a single source outside the
sphere enables us to deduce the velocity potential for a single sphere moving through
an infinite fluid. Taking the direction of motion as the axis of a, from which we will
suppose f measured, we may arrange a surface distribution of sources proportional to
