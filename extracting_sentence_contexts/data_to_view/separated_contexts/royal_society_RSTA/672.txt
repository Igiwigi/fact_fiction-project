For example, in opening the needle valve, a small portion of
valve spindle is withdrawn from the tube system, and hence the volume of the latter has
been increased by this amount and the corresponding correction must be added to the
measured volume of the expanded gas. The volume of this tube system should be kept as small as possible, for although it is
supposed to contain a constant mass of gas that supposition will not be realized if the
atmospheric pressure varies during an experiment or if the temperature of the tube
system alters. The error duc to variation in atmospheric pressure can be eliminated by
making the technique more elaborate, and a system of jacketing has in fact been applied
to the tube system for the purpose of keeping its temperature constant. The latter is

not shown in fig. 20, but consists of a system of small lead tubes, which can be bound to
the glass tube, and through which some of the bath circulating water is caused to pass.
