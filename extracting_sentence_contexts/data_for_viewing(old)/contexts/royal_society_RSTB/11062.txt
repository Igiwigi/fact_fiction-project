Cite this article: Dugdale HL, Richardson DS. Individual differences in telomere length have been linked to survival and

senescence. Understanding the heritability of telomere length can provide
important insight into individual differences and facilitate our understand-
ing of the evolution of telomeres. However, to gain accurate and

for. The aim of this review is to raise awareness of this important, but
much under-appreciated point. We outline the factors known to impact tel-

with age. We highlight statistical methods that can separate genetic from
