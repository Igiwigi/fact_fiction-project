With decreased blood-flow there will be less saliva, and this will
contain a somewhat higher percentage of salts and a considerably higher percentage
of organic substance. Further, with a given decrease of blood-flow, the stronger the
stimulus, the higher will be the percentage of organic substance and of salts. Now, sympathetic saliva is just such saliva as, from the above-mentioned facts and
deductions, we should expect to be produced by simultaneous stimulation of a secre-
tory nerve and of glandular vaso-constricted fibres. Since the decrease in the blood-
flow through the gland is much greater on stimulating the sympathetic than on bleed-
ing, the sympathetic saliva should be secreted more slowly and contain a higher per-
centage of organic substance than saliva secreted after bleeding. And this is the
case.
