From every ganglion I have ever seen, fibres proceed to their destina-
tions in at least two different directions; and from the majority of ganglia, even in the
case of those very small ones which consist only of three or four cells, fibres often pass
away in three or four different directions (fig. 5). And in every case in which I have
been able to obtain a separate ganglion-cell well prepared, I have seen at least two

* I do not feel quite confident that both the fibres proceeding from one ganglion-cell, although broad, are true
dark-bordered fibres ; but it would seem pretty certain that in some cases a dark-bordered fibre is connected with
the cell as a spiral, and in others as a straight fibreâ€”a fact which may hereafter be of some importance, as it
may afford us a positive index of the direction in which the nervye-current circulates in these elaborate organs. APOLAR, UNIPOLAR, AND BIPOLAR NERVE-CELLS OF THE FROG. 561

fibres; and although these may run parallel to each other for some distance, they have
been 80 often observed to pass in opposite directions when they reach the nerve-trunk,
that T believe myself justified in expressing a yery positive opinion that such is always
the case.
