the positive changes in the Middle East, which are greater than that of natural
variability, are not seen in HadCM3 where changes are either smaller than natural
variability or negative. Figure 2 shows that there is much stronger consensus in

many regions of the world for the CPDN ensemble compared with the CMIP3
ensemble, most likely owing to the fact that the CPDN ensemble is based only
on one GCM, albeit with a wide range of physics parameter values.

We also explored the relative importance of changes in precipitation and
evaporation on MAR, although completely disentangling the two effects is
difficult without additional experiments. In our simulations, changes in potential
evaporation (PE) are a function of temperature change only, as we assume other
variables are unchanged in the future. Actual evaporation (AE) is dependent on
both PE and soil water availability, so that in areas where there is soil water stress,
increases in PE will not translate into equivalent changes in AE. For global land
areas, the average ratio of MAR to MAP decreases in all simulations as one moves
from the present day to +2°C and +4°C worlds (not shown), indicating that AE
increases as a proportion of the overall water balance. However, this relative
