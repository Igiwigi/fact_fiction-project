In the neighbourhood of a wire containing a current, the electric tubes may in
general be taken as parallel to the wire while the magnebic tubes encircle it. The
hypothesis I propose is that the tubes moye in upon the wire, their places being
supplied by fresh tubes sent out from the seat of the 80-called electromotive force.
The change in the point of view involved in this hypothesis consists chiefly in this,
that induction is regarded as being propagated sideways rather than along the tubes
or lines of induction. This seems natural if we are correct in 8upposing that the
energy is 80 propagated, and if we therefore cease to look upon current as merely
something travelling along the conductor carrying it, and in its passage affecting the
surrounding medium. As we have no means of examining the medium, to observe
what goes on there, but have to be content with studying what takes place in
conductors bounded by the medium, the hypothesis is at present incapable of
verification. Its use, then, can only be justified if it accounts for known facts better
than any other hypothesis.

The basis of Maxwerr's Hlectromagnetic Theory.

Maxwerr's Electromagnetic Theory rests on three general principles.

I. The first principle consists in the assumption that energy has poxition, 7.e., that
it occupies space. The electric and magnetic energies of an electromagnetic system
reside therefore somewhere in the field, It is an inevitable conelusion that they are
present, wherever the electric and magnetic intensities can be shown to exist. For
