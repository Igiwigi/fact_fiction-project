PRODUCED BY HOT PLATINUM IN DIFFERENT GASES. 61

The only general conclusion which these numbers point to is that the work required
to liberate a positive ion tends to be smaller than that required to liberate a negative
ion, This is probably due to the fact that the negative ions are corpuscles, whereas
the positive ions are associated with a certain amount of matter.

Throughout this paper, the view has been maintained with regard to the negative
ionisation that it is due to the escape of corpuscles which are present in a more
or less free condition inside the metal, the variations in the amount of negative
ionisation caused by different gases being due to the eftect the gases have on the
amount of work necessary for a corpuscle to get through the surface. The positive
ionisation, on the other hand, has been supposed to be caused entirely by traces
of gas absorbed by the metal. There is, however, another view of the origin of
the positive ionisation which cannot be lightly dismissed. This is that it is due
to the escape of positive ions which are moving freely inside the metal in much
the same way as the negative corpuscles have been supposed to be, and that the
