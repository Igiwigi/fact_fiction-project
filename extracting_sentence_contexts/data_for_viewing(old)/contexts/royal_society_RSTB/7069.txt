Von den Velden (1913) first reported that the subcutaneous injection of posterior lobe
extract in man inhibited a water diuresis and at the same time caused an increased con-
centration of urinary chloride. Following this work the effects of posterior lobe extracts
on urinary salts were investigated by many workers, and it was found that in both the
hydrated and non-hydrated animal one of the most typical actions of this extract was to
increase the concentration of urinary chloride (Stehle & Bourne 1925; McIntyre & Sievers
1933; and many others). The chloride effect has more recently been used as evidence that
an anti-diuresis produced by some experimental procedure has occurred through the
mediation of the animal’s own pituitary. Thus, Pickford (1939) showed that administration
of acetylcholine inhibited a water diuresis in dogs and at the same time increased the
concentration of urinary chloride, results which were shown to be dependent upon the
integrity of the posterior lobe. These and other facts were produced as evidence that acetyl-
choline probably acted on some part of the nervous system stimulating the secretion of the
hypophysis. Van Dyke (1936) stated in his monograph (p. 326) that the ‘chloride-con-
centrating’ effect of an extract may be studied to show its similarity or otherwise to the
action of the vasopressor hormone.


ACTIONS OF THE NEUROHYPOPHYSIS 405

It was thought that investigation of the effect of stimulation of the neurohypophysis on
the concentration of urinary chloride might give additional evidence as to the site of action
of the stimulus. The urinary chloride excretion was therefore estimated during water
diuresis in seven rabbits by Whitehorn’s method. (In some cases the animals were under
