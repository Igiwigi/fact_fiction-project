Instead of insisting upon this two-fold regularisation, we may, starting
from the composition Poe eRe A ae

(Pris P2Yo. P3so «+ + PsMs)s

proceed to the singly regularised partition

(Pit Pit Py G2 Pit Ps + Ps G++ + PL). There are, in fact, various ways of forming connecting links between compositions
and partitions of multipartite numbers whatever the order of multiplicity. These
methods may be pursued at pleasure so as to obtain results of more or less interest.
