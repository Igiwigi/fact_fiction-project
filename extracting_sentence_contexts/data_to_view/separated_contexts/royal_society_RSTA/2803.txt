It will be noted
that where triplets enter, the-two satellite differences, and consequently the two
satellite separations, are extremely close to the ratio 5:3. This ratio seems to
persist also in Hg where the separations are in reverse order, and we find a ratio of
3:5 in place of 5:3. The law for this ratio is in fact much more closely obeyed
than the corresponding one for the ratio 2:1 for the triplet separations. It is
therefore of great assistance in searching for the lines of F series whose limits are
VD (2), and which consequently possess constant triplet separations in this ratio. Its
explanation should be expected to throw some valuable light on the constitution of
the atom.
