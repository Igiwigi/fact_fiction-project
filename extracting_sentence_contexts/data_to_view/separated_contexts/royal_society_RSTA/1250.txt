cit., fig. 3) indicate a value
of g-of about 8. For n’ = 2 the curve goes off the diagram, and g must be about 25
or more. In fact, his equations (16) and (19) give for large n’: g ~ 34/3n'3/2. It is
owing to these large factors near the threshold that OrrENnHEmER finds an opacity
approaching the value required in the stars. His argument is obscure.
