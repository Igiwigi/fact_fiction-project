MR. T. H. HUXLEY ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA. 45

But in any natural group of animals the grand laws of deyelopment and growth
are 80 uniform (the uniformity in fact constituting the true bond of union of its
members), that this want may be supplied by the very full information we possess
with regard to other Mollusea. If from these data certain general propositions can
be established, it will, I think, be perfectly fair to make these propositions the basis
whence deductively to explain and account for facts of organization whose absolute
genesis is not known.

The development of the Cephalopoda, Pulmonata, Nudibranchiata, and Tecti-
branchiata, has been very carefully made out by KGLuker, Van BexepeN and
WINDISCHMANN, SCHMIDT, GEGENBAUR, SARS, NoRDMANN, VocT, REib, and others.
From their observations the following generalizations may be very safely made.

1. The development of a Mollusk commences on the hemal# side, and spreads
round to the neural side, thus reversing the process in Articulata and Vertebrata.

2. In all Mollusks the axis of the body is at first straight, and its parts are arranged
symmetrically with regard to a longitudinal vertical plane, just as in a vertebrate or
