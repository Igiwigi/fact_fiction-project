In all cases the radial ribs are
seen in the negatives of the photographs to be very pronounced. Even at so early a
stage as fig. 1 the fluting is well developed. The two photographs taken of stage 3
had each of them an isolated jet, probably owing to the fact that when working with
so sticky a liquid it was difficult to avoid contaminating the cloth on which the sphere
was each time re-polished after washing in water, with the result that the sphere
behaved as if locally rough. The relatively great length of this jet brings out very
well the part played by the viscous drag in hindering the flow of that portion of the
liquid sheath which has remained in contact with the sphere. In the last figure
No. 4, of this series the droplets just visible in the centre, below the level of the

general surface, correspond to those of figs. 6 and 7 of Series XIII. at a much higher
