metals, metal to non-metal transition,

periodic table of chemical elements will be placed on recent experimental advances that
investigate how the electronic properties of chemical
Author for correspondence: elements vary with temperature and density, and how

this invariably relates to a changing status of the
chemical elements. Thus, the prototypical non-metals,
hydrogen and helium, becomes metallic at high
densities; and the acknowledged metals, mercury,
rubidium and caesium, transform into their non-
metallic forms at low elemental densities. This reflects
the fundamental fact that, at temperatures above the
absolute zero of temperature, there is therefore no
clear dividing line between metals and non-metals.
Our conventional demarcation of chemical elements
as metals or non-metals within the periodic table is
of course governed by our experience of the nature of
the elements under ambient conditions. Examination
of these other situations helps us to examine the
exact divisions of the chemical elements into metals
and non-metals (Mendeleeff D. 1905 The principles of
chemistry, vol. IL, p. 23).
