It is generally considered that the principal function of the oestrogenic hormone
secreted by the ovary is the maintenance in a suitable condition of the accessory sexual
organs and the secondary sexual characters. In the mouse, these hormones, by means of
induced mitosis, cause enlargement of the Fallopian tube, uterus, and vagina, as well as
of the mammary gland. This is indicated by the well-known fact that the removal of the
ovaries results in the atrophy of these organs, an effect which may be reversed by means
of oestrone injections (see review by Allen, Hisaw & Gardner 1939). Certainly the acces-
sory and secondary sexual organs are especially sensitive to the influence of the oestrogens,
and the study of their responses has monopolized this field of research for many years. The
result has been that these hormones have come to be regarded as almost exclusively con-
cerned with oestrous phenomena in the female sex so that they are referred to as oestrogenic
or female sex hormones, and recognized and standardized by means of the response of the
lining epithelium of the vagina.
