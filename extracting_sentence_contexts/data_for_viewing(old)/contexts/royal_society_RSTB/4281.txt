The counts made on the observation rows from June 23 onwards are plotted in
figs. 2 and 9 from the data in Tables I-XX of Appendix I.

Our remarks on these flowering-curves will deal successively with the beginning of
the curve, the rise of the curve, the maximum, and the decline of flowering.

The earliest beginning of the curve for all spacings is the same, as we have seen in
the foregoing table. Such differences as exist are not regular and are due to accident.
Consequently, there can have been no functional interference between the roots of
even the closest sown plants at the time when they differentiated their first flower-
buds. This fact is of primary importance in the analysis of yield. The greater
the number of plants on the area the greater will be the early yield, other things
being equal. With a crop which gives one almost simultaneous “yield,” such as
wheat, the root-interference effect should be very important.

The rise of the curve in this particular experiment is slightly abnormal, as we had
delayed our irrigation rather too long in early June. We shall see when dealing with
the effects of season that the true daily flowering-curve tends to smooth during its
rise to an approximately straight line. These spacing experiment curves, on the
contrary, all show a slight check during this rise, but this difference from the ideal
form merely decreases the definiteness of our final results, and does not alter them
qualitatively.
