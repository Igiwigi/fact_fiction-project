It appeared to me, on the other hand, before I had sufti-
ciently reflected on these collateral circumstances, that it could
not well be reconciled to theory, that this twilight, whose length
from c to f measured 20 lines, should at c &, where its breadth
was the greatest, .not be broader than 4, or at most 4 of
a line. 1 s00n, however, removed the difficulty by the follow-
ing deduction. From the above computation, it appears that
the side fg = kc, or the distance- of f þ, the farther edge of
the twilight from the terminator g c, was = 10g lines, or an
arc of 2* g4/ 12”. But the arc kc =Ff g, or the greatest visible


on the Atmosphere of the Moon. 349

breadth of the twilight did not lay, like the side fc, along the
- edge of the limb, but nearly at right angles to it, in a direction

immediately tending towards the eye: whence its orthographic

projection could by no means amount to 10,5 lines, but must,

according to well known principles, be less in the proportion

of the sine of 2* 34/ 12” to the cosine = 10,5, whence, by the

following computation,

Log. k c=fg = VL. 10,5 = L. 2,021189g

x Log. sin. 2* g4/ 12” - — = L.8,6516648
—— = L. o,5
This greatest apparent breadth of the twilight at the cusps
could not, therefore, exceed 0,5 lines, or full two seconds ; and
this in fact was the breadth given it by the observation. It is
scarce possible, that in the determination of so nice an object,
theory should coincide more accurately with observation.

3. But it appears farther from these observations, why, not-
withstanding all the pains'I took, I could perceive nothing of
this twilight at the terminating border of the falcated phase,
and why, on the succeeding evening, this light disappeared
likewise at the cusps.
