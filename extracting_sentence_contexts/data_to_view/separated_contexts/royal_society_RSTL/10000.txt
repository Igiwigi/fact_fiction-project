This absence of characters peculiar to the Ganoids is an indication‚Äù of how widely
8eparated in organisation are the different members of this great group. At the same time, the only group with which existing Ganoids have close affinities
is the Teleostei. The points they have in common with the Elasmobranchii are
merely such as are due to the fact that both retain numerous primitive Vertebrate
characters,* and the gulf which really separates them is very wide. There is again no indication of any close affinity between the Dipnoi and, at any
rate, existing Ganoids. Like the Ganoids, the Dipnoi are no doubt remnants of a very primitive stock ; bub
in the conversion of the air-bladder into a true lung, the highly specialised character
of their limbs? their peculiar autostylic skulls, the fact of their ventral nasal openings
leading directly into the mouth, their multisegmented bars (interspinous bars),
directly prolonged from the neural and hamal arches and supporting the fin-rays of
the unpaired dorsal and ventral fins, and their well-developed cerebral hemispheres,
very unlike those of Ganoids and approaching the Amphibian type, they form a very
well-defined group, and one very distinctly separated from the Ganoids.
