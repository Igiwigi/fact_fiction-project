After fixation with acetic bichromate, on the other hand, the yolk spherules are
deeply basophile, prolonged extraction only serving to de-stain their extreme
peripheral portions. After fixation with Hermany’s fluid, the spherules remain
unstained, are non-refringent, and vary in colour from a pale yellow to a dark brown
or even black. This coloration is due to the osmic acid in the fixing reagent,* and
is entirely independent of staining or extraction, a fact which, together with their
varying and irregular distribution, serves to sharply distinguish them from the
peripheral spherules immediately to be described. (b) Zhe Peripheral Spherules.—These spherules, as already noted, form a thin
layer immediately to the inside of the vitelline membrane. The surface of the adult
egg, and with it the inner surface of the egg membrane, is, in fixed material, almost
invariably thrown into fine wrinkles (fig. 65), the peripheral granules being collected
into the ridges so produced.
