pentoxide. As thus prepared, the gas was liable to contain traces ot hydrogen and
hydrocarbons, but that these were not in suflicient amount to affect the results was
proved by the fact that the oxygen prepared in this way gave the same results as
that obtained from potassium permanganate, which must have been free from
these impurities. The resistance readings were reduced to platinum temperatures by the method
described by CatLENDAR.* The wire was standardised by determining the melting
point of potassium sulphate by the method previously described.
