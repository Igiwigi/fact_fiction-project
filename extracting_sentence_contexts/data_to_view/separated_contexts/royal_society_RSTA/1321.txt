At that time, however, there was neither the same opportunity for continued research
as there was later in the way of knowledge and resources, nor the same spur to investiga-
tion in the shape of insistent demand for steels of special quality, as regards mechanical
strength, corrosion and other factors. In this sense, Farapay’s research was long
before its time, but that adds to, rather than detracts from, the credit due to Farapay
himself. It is true that nothing of lasting practical value came immediately from Farapay’s
laborious research on “ Steel and Alloys,”’ but, in the light of all the facts, including the
results of the present investigation, it cannot be denied that his work was indeed a brilliant
anticipation of similar labours by later metallurgists, and that it passes triumphantly
the acid-test of genuine and successful research—the search for and the discovery of
fresh knowledge. VOL, CCOXXX.—A. 2K
