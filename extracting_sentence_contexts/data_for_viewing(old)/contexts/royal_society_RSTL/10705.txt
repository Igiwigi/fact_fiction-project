This inferior, arrested, imtra-branchial framework is covered with a © lower velum,”
and the projection of the four pairs of rudimentary cerato-branchials makes it have a
crenate margin (Plate 1, fig. 4); it is the broad radiment of the membrane which
runs under the pharynx in the Lamprey at the entrance of the © branchial canal ;”
the copious growths of gill-tufts on each side, divided by the three clefts, lie under it,
partially covered.

All these larval structures may exist in the chondrocranium before the Petromyzine
skull is modified either by outer or inner bones, and the skull of the larva explains,
and is explained by, the skull of Petromy:on and its congeners.

To the Morphologist there is, here, a pause ; but, in fact, in the growth of the
Tadpole's skull, there is none ; changes begin 800n, and the work of transformation
then goes on steadily.

B. b.—Perfect chondrocranium—before the formation of bony centres—in
the © Aglossa.”

The chondrocranium of the larval Dactylethra (Phil. Trans., 1876, Plate 56) is
extremely flat and outspread ; it has all the essential parts of a Batrachian larval skull,
nevertheless. Tts form is almost triangular, with the base in front ; and althongh the
condyles of the quadrate are carried forwards almost as far as the trabecular horns, they
are a great distance apart. yen behind, the skull is greatly widened by lateral ont-
growths of cartilage, a wide *tegmen tympani ” already growing from each auditory
