vature, is no greater than that-of two similar segments, each equal to the given seg-
ment : thus, the attraction between the sphere m and the uninsulated segment n,
fig. 26, is the same as that of the similar and equal segments n 7.

These results have been arrived at by the same methods of research as those above
given (19.), figs. 9, 2. The intensity in the different experiments is supposed to be the
same, the electrified body being connected with a charged jar of such capacity that
trifling differences in the dimensions of the conductors connected with it may be con-
sidered as indefinitely small.

70. A careful induction from the above facts, led me to consider the attractive
force exerted between a charged and neutral sphere of equal diameters, as being made
up of a system of parallel forces, operating in right lines between the homologous
points of the opposed hemispheres, a conclusion quite in accordance with what has
been already shown (21.) ; for these being in exactly equal and opposite electrical
states, and similarly placed, each two corresponding points should exactly neutralize
each other's action in respect of points more distant. The whole force also may be
further considered to be as the number of attracting points directly (69.), and as the
Â£quares of the distances inversely (67.), and to be no greater than that arising from
the opposed hemispheres (69.).

71. These simple conditions, enable us to determine a point q q' within each hemi-
sphere, in which the whole attractive power may be supposed to be condensed, and to
