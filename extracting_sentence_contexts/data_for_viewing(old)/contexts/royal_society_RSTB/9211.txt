of a learned melody. Experiments such as these build on the
natural abilities of animals, as revealed by field research,
productively extending them to controlled contexts.

Snowball, the sulfur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita
eleonora) whose dance video became a YouTube sensation,
helped renew scientific interest in entrainment in non-
human species. Systematic study revealed that Snowball
could synchronize his movements to the beat of music and
adjust his rate of movement to changes in tempo [98], challen-
ging the notion that entrainment is uniquely human. The
authors suggested, moreover, that such entrainment might
be evident in other species of vocal learners. In fact, a study
of YouTube videos featuring animal ‘dancing’ provided con-
firmation of entrainment to music in vocal learning species
but not in other species (e.g. dogs [12]). Another consistent
finding was successful training of a budgerigar (Melopsittacus
undulates) to tap along with a beat [99].

That only vocal learners have the capacity for entrainment
seems reasonable, given that the three avian groups in which
vocal learning has evolved independently have similar func-
tional neural pathways that are not shared with non-vocal
learners, and are comparable to humans [100]. That is, they
have a direct connection between auditory perception areas
