expected from the air. Hence we ee that, the force which limits the speed of the mill,
follows the same complicated law as that of the resistance which would result from the
friction of the air; and hence there cannot be a doubt but that they are the same.

The Force which turns the Mill is not directly referable to Radiation.

With reference to the assumption that the force is radiant or in any way directly refer-
able to radiation, I pointed out at Bristol, before Section A (Brit. Ass0c.), that in any such
supposition the results of the experiments are directly opposed to one of the fundamental
laws of motion, viz. that action and reaction are equal. In these experiments a hot
body causes a cold body to recede, while a cold body causes the hot body to approach ;
s0 that if both the bodies were free to move, we should have the cold body running
away and the hot body running after it. This fact is, I take it, a conclusive proof that
the force does not act from body to body, but between each body and the medium in
which it is placed ; that each body, as it were, propels itself through the surrounding
medium in a direction opposite to its hottest side.

The truth of this reasoning has been set beyond all doubt by a very beautiful experiment
made by Dr. ScxvsreR. The results of this he is about to communicate to the Royal
Society ; and as his paper will contain a full account of the experiment, it is only neces-
sary here for me to refer to the results and the way in which they bear on the subject
in hand. Dr. ScxUsTER 8uspended my light-mill by a double fibre, s0 that if undisturbed

by any torsional force it would hang with the yessel always turned in one direction, but
in such delicate equilibrium that the smallest torsional force would cause it to take
