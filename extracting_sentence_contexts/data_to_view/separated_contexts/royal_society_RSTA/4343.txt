Thus, from an overall
network energy-use perspective, optical equipment is not significant today and may contribute
to improved network efficiency through greater use. Expanded use together with exponential
growth, however, will quickly become a problem if the energy efficiency does not scale with this
growth. In fact widespread use in general is likely to be problematic if further energy reductions
are not realized. A high-performance optical transceiver today requires more than 100 W, which cannot be
supported in most computing or edge applications [13]. Figure 1 depicts the evolution of the
