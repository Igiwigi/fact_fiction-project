same time a notable difference from Podocanpus, and it is significant that Bronanrart
and Gris regarded Acmopyle as a species of Dacrydium.

Only three characters stand out prominently in Acmopyle as being distinct from
Podocarpus. But they are all of sufficient importance to deserve careful attention,
for upon their interpretation largely depends the position of Aemopyle within the
family :â€”

Firstly, the vascular structure of the seed is peculiar.

Secondly, the ultimate posture of the ovule is different from that in Podocampus.

Thirdly, the rather perplexing fact that there is, to all appearance at least, no sign
of an epimatium.

These points will now be discussed in some detail.

A. The Interpretation of the Structure of Acmopyle in Relation to its Affinities.

1. The Epimatium.

The reader will have noticed that in the descriptive section of this paper no
mention was made of an epimatium. This was not because an epimatium is lacking
in Acmopyle, but because it does not figure as a distinct structure and, consequently,
its existence is only inferred from a comparison with related genera. The obvious
