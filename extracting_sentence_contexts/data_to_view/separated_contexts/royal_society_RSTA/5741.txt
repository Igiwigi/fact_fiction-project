So following the evolution of two BKL
maps at two different Mixmaster spatial points A,B, any two initial u-values will evolve after a
few steps into two uncorrelated sequences of their integer parts. Since the corresponding integer
parts fix the number of Kasner epochs in each era, the two sequences of epochs and eras of the
two spatial points A,B will be expected to be completely different. This may in fact lead to a
remarkable form of ‘gravitational turbulence’ [33] through the Kirillov-Kochnev—Montani effect
mentioned in the Introduction which is based on the alternation of Kasner epochs.

(b) Synchronized BLK maps

Then synchronization of spatial points discussed previously may have a dramatic effect
on this problem. Consider the two Kasner circles Ke : x +52 =1, and KO : Tr +17 =1,
containing the Kasner equilibrium points of the dynamical systems (2.17), (2.18) and (2.23),
(2.24), respectively. Since we have replaced the receiver variables (M1, Mz, M3) by the transmitter
variables (N1,N2,N3), the circles Ko, Ke contain all of the Kasner equilibria (which have N; =
Nz =N3=0).
