A quantitative
genetic perspective was again taken up in two landmark
papers by Queller [17,18] that note a parallel between the
.. .the ultimate criterion which determines whether G [a gene that breeder’s equation and Hamilton’s rule: each partitions evol-
causes altruism] will spread is not whether the behaviour is to utionary change into a phenotypic component (selection or
the benefit of the behaver but whether it is to the benefit of the benefits /costs) and a genetic component (heritability or relat-

edness). If social effects on fitness flow entirely through

the loss to the altruist, the criterion for positive selection of the
causative gene is phenotypes, an equation for relative fitness can be written as

The original statement of Hamilton’s rule [1, pp. 354-355]
was based upon a verbal argument:

where Py represents the effect of a focal individual’s phenotype
(z) on its own fitness and Bs represents the effect of the pheno-
type of the individual with whom it interacts (z’) [18]. (Here, we
use notation that corresponds to [21,24] instead of [18] for con-
sistency with later sections.) Equation (2.5) is analogous to (2.3),
and in fact, the terms By and Bg are selection gradients; each is a
partial regression slope estimated while holding constant the
traits of a social interactant. Elsewhere [21,24], we have called
Bw the non-social selection gradient and Bg the social selection
gradient. This is consistent with Hamilton’s use of ‘social selec-
tion’ ([38], see also [39]) but should be distinguished from other
uses of the term [40,41].
