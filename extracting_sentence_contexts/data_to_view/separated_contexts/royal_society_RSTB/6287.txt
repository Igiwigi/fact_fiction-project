In Clavelina species the
inequality is not very great, the 4 animal cells of the 8-cell stage dividing only
1-2 times as rapidly as the 4 vegetative cells. At the time of gastrulation,
however, the vegetative cells are relatively few and large, and gastrulation tends
towards epibole. Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development is
determined more by the endodermal than by the ectodermal region, and the

developmental rate is accordingly retarded to a greater degree than if the yolk had
been evenly distributed. Moreover, the chordal cells partake of the yolk proportions
of the endoderm and are usually as heavily yolk-laden as any cells in the body
(cf. Stolonica). Since chordal cell-division ceases before the yolk can be in any way
used, its presence retards the rate of chordal differentiation (swelling), and in conse-
quence the whole development of larval structures up to the tadpole stage is greatly
retarded by virtue of the greater concentration of yolk in the vegetative hemisphere.
