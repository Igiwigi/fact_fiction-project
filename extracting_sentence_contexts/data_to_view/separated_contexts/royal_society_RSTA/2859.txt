Here ‘local’ refers
to the tactile sensor measurements and ‘global’ to the average pressure. It is also noteworthy that the pressures measured with the tactile sensors (small active area)
are much higher with higher indentation speeds than with lower ones. This should be contrasted
with the fact that the average (global?) ice pressure on the nominal area is higher at the lower
indentation speeds. This is demonstrated in figure 25d. The observation on local and global
