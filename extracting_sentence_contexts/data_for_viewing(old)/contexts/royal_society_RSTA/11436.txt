Both male and female show in the regression formula for the four long bones a
remarkable feature which they have in common with the anthropomorphous apes,
namely, the negative character of the partial regression coefficient. The longer the
radius for the same value of femur, humerus, and tibia, the shorter will be the stature.
In this point women are more akin to the anthropomorphous apes than man, for the
negative radius coefficient iu formula (/) is nearly four times as large. The tibia also
has « coefficient almost double that of the male, and pointing in the same direction.

(iii.) A comparison of Table V. with Table VI. shows us that man and woman are
in all probability not only differentiated from a common stock directly with regard to
stature, but also directly with regard to all other long bones. If we use female to
construct male stature, or male to reconstruct female, we get surprisingly bad results.
The fact that the formula (/) for female diverges in a direction from that of man,
which approximates to thit of at least one species of anthropomorphous ape, is only
of course a round-about quantitative manner of indicating, what is obvious on other
grounds, that a substantial part of the differentiation of male and female took place
in that part of the history of man’s evolution which preceded his differentiation from
the stock commen to him and certain of the anthropomorphous apes.

(8.) Before we modify our formule in Tables V. and VI. to suit the reconstruction
of stature by measurements on prehistoric and other bones, we will put the numerical
values for Ms, Mr, Mr, Mu, Mg into these formule. This will serve a double purpose
(i.), it will enable us to verify our formule on Rowers material, and (ii.) it will
place at the disposal of the criminal authorities the best formule: yet available for
the reconstruction of the stature of an adult of whom one or more members have
