In the case of AD, interocep-
tive deficits were associated with hippocampal and temporal
atrophy. As such damage is consistently associated with
impaired memory mechanisms, it seems that cardiac interocep-
tion may also rely on them. In fact, phasic signals from
individual heartbeats are related to such circuits, and partici-
pants with high interoceptive accuracy perform better in
subliminal learning and memory tasks [24]. This finding
further stresses the multidimensional nature of interoception. Above and beyond those critical regions, interoceptive
accuracy also relies on widely distributed network activity.
