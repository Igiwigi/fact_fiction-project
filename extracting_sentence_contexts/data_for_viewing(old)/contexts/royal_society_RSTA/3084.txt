possible when Advanced Virgo joined the network on 1 August 2017. We will discuss that further
in the next section.

The last part of the abstract that I will highlight here is the sentence on significance: ‘The signal
was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated
to be less than 1 event per 203000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.10.’ There
are two different measures of significance quoted here, and they have quite different statistical
meaning. The signal arrived at a time when the detectors were behaving well and the noise was
Gaussian. After matched filtering with the best-fitting template from a library of waveforms that
incorporate our best understanding of inspiral-and-merger physics [17], the combined amplitude
signal-to-noise ratio was 24. This is a 240 detection, by this measure, and the probability of a false
alarm is something like 10-°°, even allowing for the fact that millions of templates would have
been tested against the data in the search. But the abstract quotes our confidence at something
like 50. This much more conservative figure comes from the fact that the detector noise is not
always Gaussian, but is characterized by random ‘glitches’, which are bursts of interference that
originate mainly within the detector.

The detectors are extremely difficult to control at this sensitivity level; they have a duty cycle
only around 60-70%, and even when in operation mode their Gaussian data are frequently
interrupted by these glitches. Since the LIGO detection criterion is that an event should be
coincident between the two detectors, the analysis constructs the probability that two randomly
occurring glitches could also be coincident, and could look enough like a binary inspiral to
masquerade as a signal. On that probability scale, we are confident that a ‘glitch event’ as strong
as GW150914 would happen by chance less frequently than once per 203000 years. This is a
