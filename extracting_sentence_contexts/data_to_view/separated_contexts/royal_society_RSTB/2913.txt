Very few approach the median plane so nearly
as to traverse both the pollen-chamber and the scar at the chalaza where the seed
was attached. The majority of “longitudinal sections” cut the median plane by 15°
or more, so that the real relations of a median section have been obtained by a process
of building up oblique sections of various sorts. In this way, with the aid of
improvised models and diagrams, an ideal median section has been reached, the proof
of whose approximate accuracy depends on the fact that the various regions in any
given oblique section fall into their right position in regard to it. The accompanying diagram (text-fig. 1) represents the true median section of
the seed, and upon it have been plotted the approximate planes of all the more
important sections that have passed through our hands, including those referred to
in the present memoir. The diagram is in no sense a restoration, the displaced
internal tissues are represented occupying the position in which they are usually
