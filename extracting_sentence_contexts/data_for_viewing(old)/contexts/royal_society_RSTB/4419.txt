_ planes, while in the paleolithic implements they appear as small platforms inter-
secting the cutting edges, and situated towards the posterior region of the specimens.
The early paleolithic implements, in many cases, exhibit a beak-like profile, which,
together with the afore-mentioned platforms, afford evidence of their derivation from
a rostro-carinate shaped flint.

It will be noticed that the seven implements selected for illustration and description
come from widely separated localities, and this fact, apart from any other, would
appear to shut out any possibility of these specimens being merely chance products due
to some abnormal method of fashioning flint implements practised by some isolated
community of early river-drift people. We appear to be dealing with a widespread
and, as the author believes, inevitable method of implement making. For, in addition
to the seven specimens here described, he has seen and handled many specimens of
early river-drift “‘side-choppers,” in reality highly evolved rostro-carinates, in the
following public and private collections. In the British Museum (Bloomsbury) there
are two from Shrub Hill, Norfolk; one from Aylesford, Kent; three from Swans-
combe, Thames Valley ; one from Brandon, Suffolk ; two from Hill Head, Southamp-
ton; and one from Kent’s Cavern, Torquay (8-foot level). In the Ipswich Museum
there are three from Suffolk (Warren Hill, Lakenheath, Mildenhall); and one from
Canterbury. Dr. W. Atten Sturer, of Icklingham Hall, also informed the author
