in which the stimulation
.2 is being applied. If the stimulation be now applied at e, the localization on the part
2 of the polypite will be still more accurate; and if applied at f (that is, almost beneath
S one end of the cut AB) the polypite may succeed in localizing quite correctly. = These facts may also be well brought out by another mode of section, which is
2 dexcribed in my former paper as © cutting round a greater or less extent of the mar-
= ginal tisue, leaving one end of the resulting strip free, and the other end attached
in s8itu.” If this form of section be practised on Tiaropsis indicans, as represented at,
= 9, k in the figure, it may always be observed that irritation of a distant point in the mar-
 ginalstrip, such as g or h, causes the polypite to move in various directions, without any
© gpecial reference to that part of the bell which the irritated point of the marginal strip
S would occupy if in 8itu, But if the stimulation be applied only one or two millims. Q Atfrom the point of attachment of the marginal strip, as at 7, the polypite will confine its
localizing motions to perhaps the proper quadrant of the bell; and if the stimulus be
applied $till nearer to the attachment of the severed strip, as at j, the localizing
motions of the polypite may become quite accurate.
