It will, at
the same time, be proper to distinguish this kind of double vi-
sion from that which is produced by a change in the refracting
media of the eye; and this will be best done by explaining the
nature of those changes in consequence of which it occurs. When one eye has had the crystalline lens extracted, the
other remaining perfect, objects seen by both eyes will appear
double. *

This is a fact which was noticed in a former lecture, in treat-
ing of the adjustment of the eye. At first it appeared difficult
to account for the double vision, particularly as the two images
were entirely separate from each other. It could not arise from
the absence of the lens, as that would not alter the situation of
the images on the retina; and the two images being of different
dimensions on similar parts of the retina, would appear to be
one before the other.
