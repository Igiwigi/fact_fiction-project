Of its breeding at Plymouth I have only a single note ; eggs were
found at the beginning of June, the only time I looked for them. These two species are convenient for studying the embryonic stages, the former
from the ease with which all stages can be dbtained, and the latter from the clear
separation of blastoderm and yolk, and the distinctness with which the nuclei of the
yolk-cells can be seen without special treatment. In the case of Balanus balanoides, which is sparsely scattered about at Plymouth
and Newquay among the Chthamalus (and sometimes hard to distinguish from it), but
very abundant at Worm’s Head, in Glamorgan, I found no eggs in July, August, or
September, these observations agreeing with Hork’s statement (30) that the develop-
ment lasts from November to February, or later.* I may add that I could not find
this species in the Bay of Naples, a fact agreeing with Darwin’s belief that it does
not extend into the Mediterranean. . For ova of Lepas anatifera, L. pectinata, and Conehoderma virgata, one has to
rely on floating pieces of timber, ship’s bottoms, &e. All stages of development
were found at Naples, at any time during the year the animals were brought in.
