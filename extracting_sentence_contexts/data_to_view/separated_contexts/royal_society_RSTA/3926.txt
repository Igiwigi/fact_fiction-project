We have however succeeded,
by maintaining the ingots for a very long time at temperatures a little below 400°,
in removing all » from alloys between the points H’ and H. We shall return to this
point. With more tin than that contained in Sn 87, that is, in the HI alloys, the primary
erystallisation should consist of H, and, in fact, as an unchilled ingot of Sn 90 shows
(fig. 89), the alloy consists of primary crystals of H in a eutectic of H and tin. The
erystals of H are often hollow, as if they had grown round something that had
afterwards disappeared ; this again suggests the possibility that, through a surfusion
of the H, the 7 may have formed first and been decomposed when the H began to
erystallise. We are not quite confident that the above is the true explanation of the
peculiar and well-known form of the H. It will be noticed that the exterior of the
crystals of H is rectilinear and angular, and that in the neighbourhood of a large
erystal of H the mother-liquid has been so much exhausted of that body that there
are no particles of H in the eutectic, while in places remote from a large crystal of H
the eutectic is full of minute specks of that body.
