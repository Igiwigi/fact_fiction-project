Gallistel [26] suggests that the
symbols for number are realized at the molecular level and
form the basis for the brainâ€™s ability to represent every kind of
quantity, not just numerosity. His theory attributes Weber's
Law to the limited number of bits used to represent magnitudes
across the many orders of magnitudes. He calls attention to the
fact that fixed-point schemes for representing number obey
Weber's Law. Hannagan et al. [27] suggest that numbers are
coded by vectors of activation across multiple cortical units. Successive integers are obtained through multiplication by a
fixed but random matrix.
