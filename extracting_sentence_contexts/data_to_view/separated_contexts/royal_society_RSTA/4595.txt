These equations were first formulated in a context where the slip velocity was always positive, 72
but for the wider class of applications, it is necessary to allow negative speeds and this renders Dw
the logarithmic terms problematic. The friction force is expected to satisfy a simple symmetry : Aas
condition: reversing the sliding direction reverses the friction force. This motivates a modified : =

(2.6) can be physically motivated (e.g. [47,52] and references therein) either:

(i) by the ‘Bowden-Tabor product decomposition’ of the interfacial shear stress, based on
considerations of interfacial asperity deformation, which suggests that

t= Ar(W)te(v), (2.9)

where A; refers to the real interfacial contact area and 1; is an asperity yield or creep stress
measure associated with deformation mechanisms determined by a thermally activated
rate process; or

(ii) by assuming that the probability of asperity slip events is also governed by a thermally
activated rate process associated with an Arrhenius law. Arguments based on microscale
creep deformation mechanisms then lead to predictions for the form of the rate-and-state
coefficients a and b [47,52]. A regularized form has thus been proposed for the generic
family of rate-state friction models:
