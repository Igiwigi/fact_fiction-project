Using this geometric set-up, what we show below is that even though the Mixmaster point
B receives only partial information, namely only the N variables, about the state of the point
A, it eventually manages to ‘reconstruct’ the other two transmitter variables Y as well, and
synchronize itself completely to A on approach to the singularity; the two different spatial points
are hereafter evolving in harmony as two indistinguishable homogeneous Mixmaster universes.


(c) Sync and Liapunov exponents

Before we properly treat the sync problem in the next two sections of this paper, we present in
the rest of this section an argument which shows that in the inhomogeneous Mixmaster setup
one in fact expects some sort of generic synchronization to appear after some threshold value
of the coupling between two spatial points is exceeded. We note that in general, we expect extra
coupling terms in the different dynamical equations of the two Mixmaster oscillating points taken
together as prescribed by the dynamics of equations (2.17), (2.18) and (2.23), (2.24).

The simplest non-trivial form of coupling is shown in the last terms of the next two equations,
and is represented by a coupling term linear in the synchronization function 2,

¥'=-Q-gE —38+a(M — 5) (3.7)
and
' =-(2—p)IT -3Q+a(5-— 1), (3.8)

where Q is the corresponding expression of S for the J7 system, and the coupling terms here are
