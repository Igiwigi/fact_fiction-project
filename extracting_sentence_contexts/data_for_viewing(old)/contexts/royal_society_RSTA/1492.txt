reflection microscopy was experimentally demonstrated in 1981 [22]. The first confocal
fluorescence image was published in 1984 [23].

In this period, the theory of confocal imaging was also developed. The PSF of a confocal
microscope with a small pinhole is equal to the product of the illumination and detection PSFs:
h(x) = hy(x)h2(x). So the OTF is the convolution of the illumination and detection OTFs: C(m) =
Ci(m) Â® C2(m) [24]. The principle of confocal optical sectioning was analysed [25]. The use of a
Bessel beam as illumination in a confocal microscope was proposed, and patented [26,27]. Image
formation in the spinning disc microscope was analysed [28]. It was shown that, in a confocal
microscope, misaligning the confocal pinhole results in an improvement in spatial resolution
[29]. As the detector element is moved away from the optical axis, the width of the PSF becomes
narrower, the peak of the PSF becomes weaker, the sidelobe level increases, and the peak of the
PSF moves laterally. These effects explain the fact that ISM gives better resolution than a confocal
microscope. Image formation in confocal fluorescence microscopy was analysed, and improved
resolution predicted [30]. A confocal microscope with computer control, image acquisition and
processing was developed [31]. The three-dimensional (3D) spatial frequency cut-offs of the
confocal microscope in transmission, reflection and fluorescence modes were presented [32].

Commercial confocal microscopes started to become widely used in biomedical research
laboratories around 1990. Also in the 1990s, commercial spinning disc microscopes became
available. It became appreciated that in order to record a fluorescence image of adequate strength,
a pinhole larger than around 1 Airy Unit (AU), equal to the size of the Airy disc in the detector
plane, should be used, thus eliminating the transverse resolution improvement of confocal
microscopy.
