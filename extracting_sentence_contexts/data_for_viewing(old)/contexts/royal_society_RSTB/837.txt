output has no tendency to automatically increase the force of the ventricular con-
tractions. We refer to the bearing of this in cases of plethora. (Pp. 269-274.)

Increase of the watery constituents of the blood increases the contraction volume
and output to the same extent (though only temporarily) as does transfusion of
blood, but acts still more unfavourably on the heart, seeing that the work done
by the ventricles is increased, while the nutritive value of the blood supplied to the
coronaries is diminished.

The increased output of the heart both in plethora and in hydrsemia is due to rise
of pressure in the systemic veins, increasing the volume of blood which enters the

aight ventricle during diastole. We refer to the bearing of these facts upon the
‘dreatment of chlorosis and heart disease. (Pp. 274-278.)
2 In Section XIV. we consider the limits of the power of the heart to perform the
york thrown upon it, and show that, in strictly physiological conditions, and in spite
vot the beautiful mechanism by which the force of the ventricular contraction is
Fegulated, the heart, like the voluntary muscles of the body, is liable to fatigue when
She work thrown upon it greatly exceeds that required to maintain the circulation
ainder ordinary circumstances. We take as example the increase in work thrown upon
he organ during active muscular exertion, and show that exertion and endurance of
‘datigue are limited mainly by the limited power of the heart to continue supplying
She increased amount of blood which is required by the acting voluntary muscles,
e show that those luxuries which are forbidden or limited in “ training,” and which
gure known to hinder prolonged exertion, such as water, alcohol, tobacco, caffein, all
