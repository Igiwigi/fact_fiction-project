Great advance is seen in the staminal
tube which closely invests the nucellus region of the ovule, now grown to a pyriform
mass enclosed by a relatively thin integument ; this is continued into a long tube now
definitely kinked on the posterior side, but retaining the stigmatic head well pressed
against the investing perianth. Four special growth-extensions may be noted :
(1) gamophyllous zone of the perianth ; (2) staminal tube ; (3) staminal filaments ;
(4) “stylar” tube of integument. Growth-curvatures are seen in: (1) the staminal filaments ; (2) the stylar tube ;
these appear to be largely accidental features of growth, due in the former case to
the fact that two lateral stamen-primordia were dropped below the horizontal level of
