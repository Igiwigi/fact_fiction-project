Tre increasing extent of steam navigation, and its importance to the welfare of
this country, demand a strict attention, not only to the construction of the vyessels,
but to the application of the power of steam, in order that the greatest possible use-
ful effect may be produced with a given quantity of coals. The action of paddle-
wheels, although a snbject strictly mathematical, has hitherto but little engaged the
attention of scientific men ; in fact, the motion of the vessel being horizontal, while
that of the wheel is rotary, there result a certain peculiarity and complication of
action which almost defy the theorist to unravel without the aid of a complete set of
experiments ; for the great commotion of the water in the neighbourhood of a steam-
vessel is snch, that the results calculated from the usnal laws of the resistance of
fluids would scarcely be considered satisfactory without having the means of com-
paring them with practical results. In this respect I have been very fortunately cir-
cumstanced ; all, or nearly all, His Mazgsty's vessels are fitted out at Woolwich, and
each vessel is submitted to an accurate experiment, to ascertain its speed before it
leaves the river, sometimes light and sometimes laden, The exact amount of their
cargoes is known, their registered and actual tonnage, area of paddle, and every
other particular which can serve as a guide to such inquiry; and I have availed
myself of these circumstances, and of my personal acquaintance with many of their
