.coast where the depth is only a few fathoms, and it is therefore necessary to be very
critical of the sites of observations of currents. The best results seem to be given at
small islands with rapidly shelving sides, for the currents there are modified little by
the form of the bottom and can be regarded as fairly typical of the general currents
in the neighbourhood.

At the Anamba Islands (see map, fig. 1) the semi-diurnal tide appears to be
usually much less than the diurnal one. The ‘China Sea Pilot,’ vol. 3, states that for
a few days in each month, when the moon is near the Equator, there are two high
tides in the day. It is easily seen that for two tides to occur in the day the
amplitude of the semi-diurnal term must be at least a quarter of that of the diurnal
term. It would not, however, vary much with the moon’s declination, whereas that
of the diurnal term vanishes when the moon is on the Equator ; and the above fact
shows that the semi-diurnal tide only attains this fraction of the diurnal tide when
the latter is at its least. The true semi-diurnal tide at the Anamba Islands must
therefore be insignificant. The same is evidently true of the currents, for the tidal
streams take a day to run backwards and forwards.

In the Gulf of Siam also the tides are mainly diurnal. The oscillation in this is a
forced one due to that in the South China Sea, and as the latter is diurnal so is that
in the Gulf of Siam. Actually the only place where the semi-diurnal tide is
considerable is Bangkok Harbour, at the head of the gulf. This tide seems to
increase in relative importance towards Bangkok, for at Kamput on the eastern side
and places in about the same latitude on the western side the tides are said to be
very irregular, indicating the presence of some complicating influence. On the whole,
