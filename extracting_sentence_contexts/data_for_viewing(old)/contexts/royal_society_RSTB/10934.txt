become easy. However, we propose that imperfect mimicry
arises because predators frequently have to first learn how
discriminate between mimics and models. Gaining infor-
mation comes at a cost, so even if a predator employs its
available information in the most optimal way, then it will
often end up using overly simplified rules of thumb to
sort profitable from unprofitable prey, allowing crude imita-
tions to persist.

The various hypotheses that have been proposed to
explain imperfect mimicry are not mutually exclusive and
we are not in a position to evaluate their relative importance.
However, the fact that learning is so widespread in experi-
ments dealing with Batesian mimicry, and is considered the
key driver of Mullerian mimicry, strongly suggests that infor-
mation limitations may play an important role in shaping the
phenotypes of mimics.
