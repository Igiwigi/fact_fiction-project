2347. On carefully lowering the temperature of the nickel, it was again found that
the transition from one degree of magnetic force to the other was progressive, and
not instantaneous. With iron it is difficult to preserve all the parts, either in heating
or cooling, 80 nearly at the same temperature as to be sure that it is not the union of
hotter and colder portions which gives the appearance of an intermediate degree of
magnetism ; but with nickel that is not s0 difficult, for the progression is more gra-
dual, so that when in cooling the power began to increase, the cooling might be con-
tinued some time before the full degree of power came on; at any time in that pe-
riod the temperature might, be slightly raised, and though the power would then
diminish a little, it could yet be retained at a degree stronger than the weakest, In
fact it was easy to keep the nickel at many of the intermediate degrees of power,
and thus to remove all doubt of the progressive assumption of the full degree of
force.

2348. I have expressed an opinion, founded on the different temperatures at which
the magnetic metals appeared to lose their peculiar power}; that all the metals would
probably have the same character of magnetism if their temperature could be lowered
sufficiently. The facts just described appear to me entirely against such an opinion.
The metals which are magnetic retain a portion of their power after the great change
has been effected, or in what might be called their diamagnetic state ; but the other
metals, such as bismuth, tin, &c., present no trace of this power, and therefore are not
in the condition of the heated iron, nickel, or cobalt ; for in fact whilst these point
axially and are attracted, the others point equatorially and are repelled. I therefore
