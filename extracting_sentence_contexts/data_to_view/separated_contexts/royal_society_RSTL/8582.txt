From the 14th of April the temperature was oyer 40? C.; this may be easily accounted
for by the fact that, from this date for the next four or five days, a number of secondary
pocks had been cut out from different parts, whereby extensive suppuration was pro-
duced in different places. Besides the characters of the primary and secondary pocks above mentioned, they
had all the common character, that when excised, no matter whether it was twenty-four
hours after their appearance, or whether they were in the stage of increase of size, or
of the formation of the pustules, or in the stage of drying up, the subcutaneous loose
tisse by which the skin is connected with the subjacent adipose or muscular tissue

& was always found in a state of cxdema. This cedema was greatest in the stage of their

a increase in s8ize and for a short time after.
