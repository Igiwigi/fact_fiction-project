mouth leads into this pouch ; during life it was probably closed by the mucous mem-
brane of the mouth. 3. The lower labial cartilage (se also Plate XXXV. fig. 3, la),
forming a broad trenchant fringe round the extremity of the mandible.

The part of the cartilage which bears the two trenchant front teeth I consider to be
the zomer (Plate XXXIV. fig. 3, v). It is very similar in form to the yomer of many
Teleosteous fishes, and has two free lateral edges, whilst behind it is suturally connected
with the pterygo-palatines; it is entirely cartilaginous, and passes into the sphenoid car-
tilage above the symphysis of the pterygo-palatines. 'The corresponding part in Lepido-
8ren has been regarded by Professor OwEN* as the intermaxillary, and by Professor
Biscnory, PerERs, and others as belonging to the ethmoid or nasal bone, Professor
Biscnovy and PeTERs considering the cartilaginous space behind the palatal arch to be
= yomer. From the fact that the vomer occupies nearly always the same position in

e 8kull of fishes, and from the frequency of its being armed with teeth, I conclude
Fhat this part of the Ceratodus-skull is the vomer. A. comparison with the skull of

enopoma will also much assist in determining it as such.

2 Towards the upper surface of the skull the vomerine cartilage passes into the ethmoid
nasal portionf, which is easily distinguished by its double perforation by the olfactory
merves (Plate XXXV. fig. 1, 0, and fig. 2, 07); its upper surface has a thick osseons
Jayer (Plate XXXTIV. fig. 1, 6, and Plate XXXV. 5), which appears as a distinet trian-
lar bone without median suture, the apex being directed forwards, whilst its base
Jet a serrated suture with the frontals and sclero-parietal; anteriorly it passes into
