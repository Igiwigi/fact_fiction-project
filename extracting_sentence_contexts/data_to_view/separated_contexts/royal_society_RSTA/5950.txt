Social norms can make any


type of behaviour stable; they can be contrary to the collectively optimal outcome, and in fact
reinforce suboptimal behaviour. Examples are norms that promote blood feuds [73], hate speech
[74], compliance with protection rackets [75], corruption [76] or female genital mutilation [45]. How can we promote positive change when social norms are contrary to and, in fact, reinforce
unsustainable behaviour? Public service announcements and educational efforts that rely on
normative messages to alleviate problematic conduct can be undermined by the perception that
the behaviour to be changed is common (i.e. by empirical expectations that suggest otherwise). An
answer to this question will require studying norms that sustain socially undesirable behaviour
(e.g. [77,78]), and particularly how to change them, e.g. through the framework of trending norm
interventions [79].
