Both H* and H# can also react with other heavier species, and the following reactions are
extremely efficient for any species X with proton affinity greater than molecular hydrogen: ia

Ht +X — XH* + Hp e7

Ht +X —> XHt. (2.8) :§

This very effectively destroys H+ and Hf close to the homopause where hydrocarbons (e.g.
methane, acetylene and ethane) are present. Methane is present in the stratosphere because it is
transported vertically from depth, and methane photochemistry drives the production of species
such as acetylene and ethane (e.g. [5,6]). The fact that Ht and Hy and hydrocarbons cannot coexist
has two implications. Firstly, a planet with strong vertical eddy mixing in the stratosphere move
hydrocarbons up to higher altitudes, reducing the size of the H} ionosphere. A change in the
homopause height could therefore dramatically change the vertical profile of the ionosphere.
Secondly, if a planet has very energetic particle precipitation the ionization peak may occur in
the hydrocarbon layer below the homopause region. In this case, H} would be produced by
the softer tail of the precipitating electron energy distribution, and observations of H} emission
may provide an incomplete view of how the injection of auroral energy alters the state of the
atmosphere.

Because the ionosphere is charged, its constituents are subject to the forces exerted by
the magnetic field. This region is therefore an important interface layer between the planet and the
magnetosphere. For example, the field lines that are accelerated away from rigid rotation in the
