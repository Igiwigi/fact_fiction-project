the second equi-density line on the plate—it is found that the sensibly rectilinear
plotting of the experiments is in agreement with theory. The fall in the specific heat
between about 10° and 100° C. calculates, in fact, to be 0°00103. This is a far wider
range than the range of mean temperatures in the experiments. The experiments did
not cover more than half this range, and must have been competent to show a varia-
tion of one part in 2000 upon values of @ lying between 0°223 and 0:054 grammes.
This was hardly to have been expected. And this applies more forcibly to the lowest
line, the density 0°0456.

On endeavouring to apply the thermodynamic equation to the line p = 0°180, it
appeared that it was less agreeable with the experiments. The reason of this is
probably to be found in the inapplicability of the formula to serve as the equation of
the gas at high pressures, It is, in fact, based upon ReGNavuut’s observations. Nor

dioxide when tested with AmAcar’s results. It is easy to test this point by calcu-
lating for the pressure at the density 0°1800 at some chosen temperature, and com-
paring with Amacar’s results. A deficiency in the value of the pressure given by
