When, at a later period, zoologists became acquainted with a sinular Tortoise from the
Galapagos Islands, some considered the latter specifically distinct, whilst others main-
tained that they were specimens of the same species, © which had been scattered by man
in different tropical parts of the globe ” (Gray, Shield Rept. 1855, p. 7). However, a closer examination and comparison of the remains at my disposal revealed
important differences unmistakably pointing at a multiplicity of species; and as the
remains were of a comparatively very recent period, s0 that I could reasonably expect
to find carapaces, skeletons, or even stuffed examples of the yery same species in our
collections, it became imperative, for the proper interpretation of the Mauritian remains,
to include in my researches the forms known or suppoxsed to be still living. The results
of these researches were startling, and may arrest the attention of the zoologist all the
more, as the facts elucidated bring us face to face with the mystery of the birth and
life of an animal type. I may shortly indicate them as follows :—

Tortoises, the Rodriguez species differing more markedly from those of Mauritius than
