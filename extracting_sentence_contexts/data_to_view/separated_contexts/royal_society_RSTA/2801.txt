The dual Poisson—Lie group of (K,0) is t* equipped with the Lie—Poisson : 3
structure defined in the previous subsection. [8

The linearization of the Poisson bivector of K* at the group unit equals the Poisson bivector 7

of t*. Therefore, K* and €* are isomorphic as Poisson manifolds in a neighbourhood of their group
units by local normal forms for Poisson manifolds [21]. In fact, this isomorphism extends globally. Theorem 2.1 (Ginzburg—Weinstein Theorem [20]). The Poisson manifolds (t*, m+) and (K*, 1K*)
are Poisson isomorphic.
