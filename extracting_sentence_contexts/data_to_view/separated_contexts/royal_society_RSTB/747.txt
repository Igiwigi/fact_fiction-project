In the adult skull the sutures in the brain case have completely disappeared: the
nasals have ankylosed with the nasal processes of the premaxille, with one another,
and with the ethmo-presphenoid: the lacrymal has united with the ectoethmoid
and with the descending process of the nasal; and the palatine processes of the pre-
maxilla, the maxille, jugals, quadrato-jugals, vomer, palatines, and pterygoids, are
all immovably united together. Thus the quadrate and the columella are the only
free bones in the skull. Owing, however, to the slenderness of the connection
between the nasal and palatine processes of the premaxille, and to the fact that the
bones of the palate remain free from those of the base of the skull, the whole palate
(i.e., the united palatine processes of the premaxille, maxille, jugals, quadrato-
jugals, palatines, pterygoids, and vomer) can be lifted away from the skull proper, the
slender body of the premaxillee serving as a hinge.

2. THE VERTEBRAL CoLUMN, INCLUDING THE Rts.

a. At the time of Hatching (Stage K).
(Plate 15, figs. 175-190.)

The detailed descriptions of the vertebral column in the adult given by Owen (24)
and by Mrvarr (21) allow me to confine myself to such points of structure as can
only be made out by the examination of young specimens.
