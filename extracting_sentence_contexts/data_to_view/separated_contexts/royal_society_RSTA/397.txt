This will cause volatiliza-
tion and decomposition of most lubricants and is an important cause of the breakdown
of the lubricant film. If either the load or the speed is too great, a welding together of
the “hot spots” on a large scale may occur with consequent damage or seizure of the
surfaces. The fact that an electromotive force is developed shows that some metal to
metal contact is occurring through the lubricant film. This is in harmony with some
earlier work (Beare and Bowden 1935) which showed that the boundary film of
lubricant was unable to afford complete protection to the sliding surfaces. Some wear
and abrasion of the surfaces always occurred.
