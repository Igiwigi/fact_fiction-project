in a very isolated position. The chief importance they possess is that they are so old,
and that they prove the existence of undoubted higher woody Angiosperms in Northern
Europe at this time.

In conclusion, I must thank the many botanists who have looked at and expressed
opinions on these fossils. If, as I mentioned on p. 91, I found these views so
conflicting that they tended to neutralise each other, it leaves me no less grateful to
all who expressed them. I must specially mention Mr. L. A. Boopiz, F.LS.,
Prof. Percy Groom? F.L.S., and Prof. F. W. O. Ontver, F.R.S., to whom I have
been indebted for various kindnesses, and Dr. D. H. Scorr, F.R.8., who communicates
the paper. My thanks to Dr. Smrra Woopwarp are recorded on p. 77. To the
Rey. F. F. Horr I am indebted for help and kindness at Woburn Sands. I must
also acknowledge with thanks the fact that some of the expenses of the work were
defrayed out of the Royal Society Government Grant, which had been given me
for the general study of Cretaceous plants.
