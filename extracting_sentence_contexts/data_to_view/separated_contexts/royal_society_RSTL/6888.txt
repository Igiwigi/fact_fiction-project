In the several patches of high-level
grayels (chiefly of subangular chalk-flints) between Amiens and Abbeville, tertiary d6bris
continue to be found, and at Moulin Quignon sandstone-fragments of a large 8ize are
$till numerous, although they are fewer and smaller than at St. Acheulf. The occurrence of rolled fragments and boulders of granite and other old rocks in the
valley of the Seine at Paris, is a fact which has long been well known. The presence
of similar materials of distant origin has also been proved to hold good in the higher-
leyel gravels of Gentilly and Charonne. M.
