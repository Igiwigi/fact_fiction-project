Research by Gerd Gigerenzer and others shows
that doctors, for example, are often misled by information presented in
the form of probabilities rather than sample frequencies. The statement
that a diagnostic test has a 5 per cent probability of a false positive is
misinterpreted more often than the statement that five patients out of
every hundred taking the test will show a false positive (e.g. [17]). This
is compounded by the fact that many forecasts are not of the kind where
reference back to a sample frequency is informative. Forecasts made today
of the weather or the inflation rate at some date in the future are unique;
they are not the outcomes of a repeated experiment. Decisions about saving
for future pension provision, for example, are difficult to make the subject
of experimentation, although we can learn from the experience of others.
