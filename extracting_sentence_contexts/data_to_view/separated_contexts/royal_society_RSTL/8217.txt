Nevertheless I cannot withstand the impression that this general and common mode
of origin may, under rare conditions, be supplemented by another and an abiogenic
mode of origin. The facts on which this impression rests are only isolated and quasi-exceptional
units among countervailing hundreds; but the record of this inquiry would be incom-

Â© plete without an account of them. The facts alluded to consist, first, of cases of retarded germination of Bacteria; and,
secondly, of two cases in which fungoid vegetation, of a type new to me, appeared in
plugged bulbs after being heated in boiling water. In studying the sterilization of organic liquids by heat, I found, as a rule (as already
sated), that if germination did not take place within four days it did not take place at
all; that is, the media proved to be permanently sterilized. But occasional exceptions
to this rule were encountered, in which the media remained sterile for six, eight, and,
