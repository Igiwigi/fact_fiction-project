This effect is mirrored explored a more classic transmissionâ€”-virulence trade-off
by varying the rate of parasite production; for low production with seasonally forced host reproduction. Under standard
levels the dynamics are equilibria and there is a slight down- assumptions the parasite fitness could be found analytically
ward trend, but as production increases cycles emerge and (since the average host density over one period is constant),
the CSS transmission increases. Why do we see these patterns? and they found that parasite fitness was in fact unaffected
Focusing on competition, in the equilibrium region, increasing by the amplitude or period of the seasonal forcing. However,
competition leads to higher transmission (lower resistance). if virulence is density-dependent then parasite fitness
Similarly to the high competition case in figure 3a, selection depends on the average total population density, which is
