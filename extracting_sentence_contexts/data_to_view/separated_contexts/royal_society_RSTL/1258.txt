no distinct taste, but a smell resembling naphtha ; a portion
of it taken out mixed with the water, when exposed to heat
acted like fixed oil, and it seemed to have a high temper-
ature of ebullition. It inflamed, producing a white smoke. The fact, of almost a perfect vacuum existing in a cavity
containing an expansible but difficultly volatile substance, may
be considered as highly favourable to the theory of the
igneous origin of crystals: the other experiment is of a nature
entirely different, though its result may be explained in the
same'Supposition. In examining a crystal in the collection of the Royal Insti-
tution, and which from its characters I believe to be from
Capas d'Olanda, Province of Minas Geraes, Brazil, I observed
that the quantity of aeriform matter was unusually small in
proportion to the quantity of fluid, in two or three cavities
not occupying +5 0r -; of the space; and from the peculiarity
of its motion, it appeared to be more likely to be compressed,
than rarefied elastic fluid; and in piercing the sides of the
cavities I found that this was the case ; it enlarged in volume
from ten to twelve times; the fluid was water, but the gas
was too minute in quantity to be examined,

It will be interesting to ascertain under what circumstances,
and in what situations crystals of this kind are found, If they
be supposed of igneous origin, they must have been formed
under an immense weight of atmosphere or fluid, sufficient to
produce a compression much more than adequate to compen-
sate for the expansive effects of heat, a supposition which, in

consequence of Mr. PErKxins's experiments, already alluded
to, may be easily formed, |
