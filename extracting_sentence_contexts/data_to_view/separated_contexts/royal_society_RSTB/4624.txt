Secondly, sections from the wings of a
number of beetles, among them several investigated by BrepeRMANN, are figured
and described later, but excepting in certain peculiar Cetoniids, no trace of any
structure corresponding to the “ Stdébchenschicht” could be discovered. It seems
possible that BreDERMANN may have mistaken the net-like pattern (“ Wabenwerk”),
nearly always to be seen on the wing-cases, for the ends of the rods or
“ Stdbchen,” and referred to the presence of a “ Stdébehenschicht,” which only existed
in a few exceptions. These include Heterorrhina elegans, Fapr., as well as
H. africana, Drury,t which differ from ordinary beetles in their structure, and in
the fact that their colour remains after removal of the surface cuticle. Moreover, all
sections cut tangentially to the surface show the characteristic colour, even when
mounted in Canada balsam, if they are examined by reflected light. These rods,
which contain yellow pigment, may possibly scatter blue light, as has been suggested
in the case of many similar structures.
