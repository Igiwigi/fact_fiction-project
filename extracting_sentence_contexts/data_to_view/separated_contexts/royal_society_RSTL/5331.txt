Art. (29.). If now we return to the syzygetic equation, 7,f—77+9=0, 9 may be
treated as known, having in fact been completely determined as a function of the
roots, as well in its most general form, as also $0 as to represent the simplified residues
tof and @ in the” preceding articles ; it retnains to determine the values of 7 and
as functions of the roots corresponding to any allowable form of 9, but I shall confine
the investigation to the case where 9 is the TJowest-weighted conjunctive, or which
