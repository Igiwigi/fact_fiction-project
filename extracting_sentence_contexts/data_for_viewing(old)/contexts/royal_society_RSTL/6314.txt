But by ABEL's theorem, this transcendental equation is equivalent to an algebraical
= fact, calling the radical y az, then if px, x are rational and integral functions
of x with arbitrary coefficients, and if
gr—paroe=Aa—kNa—k)...(0—k,),

(this implies that @*z is of a degree not exceeding 7 and xx of a degree not exceeding
1n—3; that is, for » even the degrees of @x, x7 are 3, 3(n—4); and for n odd they are
1(n—1), 3(n—3)), then the algebraical equation is that obtained by the elimination of
the arbitrary coefficients from the system of equations
