the correct axiomatizations. So did mathematicians settle on the modern axioms for a group only oO

and they had for long been investigating various forms of ‘spaces’ before the modern notion of Dw
‘topology’ emerged. For proofs, we are in a similar situation. Only when we fully understand :
what we mean by ‘proof’, we can start to agree on an axiomatization. : a

(b) From syntactic proofs to combinatorial proofs

For this reason, the combinatorial approach seems to be more promising. The first attempt in
that direction was through Andrews’ matings [61], which kept only the axiom links of a proof.
Figure 3 shows the matings for the two sequent proofs in figure 1—both sequent proofs have
identical matings. In fact, Andrews considered these matings to be the ‘essence’ of a proof, and
thus provided a proposal for a nontrivial notion of proof identity. The more recent work in [62]
provided a notion of proof composition for matings.

However, checking the correctness of matings takes exponential time’. This means that
checking correctness of a proof object for a formula is as expensive as proving the formula
from scratch. What we need are canonical proof objects whose correctness can be checked in
polynomial time.

For (multiplicative) linear logic, this goal was achieved by Girard’s proof nets [63], where the
basic idea is essentially the same as for matings—keep the information about which atom pairs
meet in an axiom link. But because of linearity, checking correctness can be done in polynomial
time. In order to obtain this property for classical logic, we have to keep track of the places
