Simulation routines are
the ground for similarity relations that depend only on the
qualities of the simulations themselves, i.e. they depend on
structural characteristics of the simulations. Most impor-
tantly, as it is the case for icons, simulation routines can be
considered filtered signs. In fact, they are not actions or per-
ceptions that a subject is currently carrying out nor are they
their exact copies. Simulations are the abstract and schematic
enactment of features that identify an action or event, inde-
pendently of any specific movement or sensory-motor
contingency that might be involved in it. To come back to
the example briefly sketched in the previous section on the
abstract character of the mechanism of simulation, Umilta
et al. [46] showed that both macaquesâ€™ ventral premotor and
primary motor cortices contain neurons able to code the


goals (i.e. an abstract schematization) of motor actions inde- and tactile areas respond to vision and audition).
