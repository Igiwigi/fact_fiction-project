general result is a qualitative confirmation of the previous experiments, although no
quantitative, as the early consolidation of the outer layers of metal prevents tht
free expansion of the interior.
These experiments were made in 1879-80, and proved that grey iron and white iro!

culative, until some method of examining the physical properties of wrought
within the range of temperature known as the welding heat could be devised.
This brief statement of my earlier researchest will serve to lead to the work
embodied in the present paper, which shows that wrought iron at the welding
