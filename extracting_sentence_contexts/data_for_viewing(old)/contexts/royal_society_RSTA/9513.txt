which is nearly equal to the experimental value. Therefore the increase of x on passing
from the paramagnetic to the ferro-magnetic state can be represented by a purely
magnetic molecular field due to the magnetons contained in the iron molecules. This
increase of x is represented on Wetss’s theory by the molecular field NI + 10° gauss,
and therefore 10’ gauss is the magnetic field due to the magnetons when the iron is
saturated. The continuity of magnetic induction demands that this field is to a large
extent localized (see p. 89 supra).

Now reverting to diamagnetic substances we are led, in the light of Rrrz’s
theory, to identify the local molecular field (10’ gauss) in their case as due to
the existence of molecular magnets, so arranged that for any particular molecule
the moment is zero. It seems that we could readily account on such a view for
the fact that the chemical combination of two diamagnetic substances can give
rise to a paramagnetic substance possessing magnetons. This is the case for
instance with the union of copper (diamagnetic) and sulphuric acid (diamagnetic)
resulting in the formation of cupric sulphate (which is paramagnetic and contains
10 magnetons to the molecule). The forces which come into play during the
chemical combination we may regard as upsetting the magnetic equilibrium of each
component.

If these molecular magnets do exist in diamagnetic substances then the local
molecular field of the diamagnetic substance will be comparable with the molecular
field in ferro-magnetic substances, and will be represented as far as they are concerned
by a true magnetic field of intensity 10’ gauss (approximately). In this case the
localized nature of the field is a necessary consequence of zero moment which has
