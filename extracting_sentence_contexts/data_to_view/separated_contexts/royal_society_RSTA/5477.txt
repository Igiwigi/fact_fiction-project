We applied the proposed formalism to two datasets of cardiovascular and respiratory time
series and compared the values obtained by the new total measure of causality with those


from the standard GC. In cardiovascular variability analysis, instantaneous interactions typically
occur as within-beat effects between the observed time series (e.g. the heart period, arterial
pressure and respiration) which likely result from common driving factors such as the neuro-
autonomic regulation. Therefore, it is important to account for instantaneous effects in the
analysis of GC between cardiovascular time series, also in view of the fact that GC quantifies
the causal effect that the underlying mechanism (in this case, autonomic control) has on the
measured variables, rather than quantifying the mechanism itself [28]. In other words, data-
driven methods to infer statistical dependencies always come with this ambiguity of confusing
map and territory, and methods used to compute them with target properties of the system
under exam [29]. Our results show that the spectral iGC, differently from the standard GC,
peaked more clearly at the physiologically relevant frequencies when instantaneous effects were
significant.
