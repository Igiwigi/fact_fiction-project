drops out of the spectrum, the flame becoming red ; the band spectrum and 46075 are
now very brilliant, and the solidified mass becomes white-hot and emits a continuous
spectrum. If it be placed in a test-tube and treated with an acid it effervesces ; and if ;
submitted to the action of nitric acid and starch no blue colour is produced. >

Evidently, then, the iodine has been driven off, and the mass consists in all probability
mainly of strontic oxide with some strontic carbonate.

It seems then that the breaking up of the compound and the volatilization of the
iodine consume 80 much heat that the Sr I, never gets sufficiently heated to enable it to
be volatilized ; and hence we should not see its spectrum eyen were the flame sufficiently
hot to render its vapour luminous, and the body sufficiently stable to bear 8uch a heat
without decomposition. The fact, however, is, that what spectrum is seen is produced
by the decomposing action of the flame acting either on small quantities of the Sr 1;,
which do get volatilized, or, what is more probable, are mechanically carried off by the
ascending currents of iodine vapour. It is to be remarked that when the bead has
become infusible the spectrum begins to die out ; the orange band then only appears
very faintly, and 4607-5 has utterly gone. We then have the non-yolatile oxide only

left in the flame, and it of course cannot give any thing but the continuous spectrum
due to its own incandescence. P

Strontic Bromide behaves very much in the same manner as the iodide, the difference
that exists depending on the greater stability of the latter componnd in the flame.
On removing the bead but slight fuming is obseryable, and there is very little odour of
