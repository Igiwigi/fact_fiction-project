Of secondary, but still considerable, importance is the demon-
stration that the methods of strength estimation in common use may lead in some cases
to serious error. Questions relating to methods of securing the indicated increase in tenacity, or of
eliminating the uncertainty in strength calculations, can scarcely be answered without
some more or less definite knowledge of the way in which the properties of molecules
enter into the phenomena under consideration. In this connection it is of interest to
enquire whether any indication can be obtained of the nature of the properties which
are requisite for an explanation of the observed facts. For this purpose it is convenient to start with molecules of the classical type, whose
properties may be defined as (a) a central attraction between each pair of molecules
which decreases rapidly as their central distance increases, and which depends only on
that distance and the nature of the molecules ; (b) translational and possibly rotational
vibrations whose energy is the thermal energy of the substance. In the unstrained
state, the kinetic reactions due to (b) balance the central attractions (a).
