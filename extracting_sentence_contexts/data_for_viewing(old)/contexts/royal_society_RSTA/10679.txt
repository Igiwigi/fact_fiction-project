system of shears is, however, self-equilibrating. The shear is zero at the centre and
at the circumference, and its greatest value does not exceed about 1/4 of the laterally
applied shear. Its effects, at some distance inside the cylinder, will therefore be
small compared with the effects of the large and unbalanced lateral distribution
of shear.

We notice that, for so short a bar, the lateral contraction is very much less than
the contraction we should expect according to the “uniform tension” theory. In
fact it never amounts to 60 per cent. of that contraction. For points deeper in the
material, the contraction is much smaller than this. Thus, for 7 = (2) a, the lateral
contraction is 22 per cent. and for 7 = (‘4) a it is 9 per cent. of what it should be on
the “ uniform tension” hypothesis, This seems due to the fact, in itself extremely

material. Indeed, referring to Diagram 3, we see that the radial tension amounts to

about 1/5th of the mean tension Q which would give the same total pull, and which has
been consistently taken as the unit of comparison. These tensions are changed to
pressures after passing the ring of shear, which is in accordance with the general
compressive effect mentioned above.
