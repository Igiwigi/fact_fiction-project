“taxinean sculpturing” in the secondary wood, for it occurs in some of the Abietinese
(Pseudotsuga, Larix, Picea; see GoTHAN, 1905, p. 98)—a tribe of Conifers which
probably has very little to do with the Taxales.

Tt is difficult to say what significance can be attached to Roruert’s discovery ot
so-called “ parenchymatous tracheides” in the pith of a species (or perhaps only a
variety) of Cephalotawus (1899, p. 275). From Roruert’s account and from some
preparations which Mrs. ArBrR very kindly allowed me to examine, these tracheides
do not essentially differ from the familiar transfusion tracheides associated with the
leaf-strand in numerous Conifers. In their presence in an axial organ they are
certainly unusual, but not unique, for similar elements occur also in the branch
system of the cladode of Phyllocladus (see p. 289). Mention may also be made of
the fact that the presence of secretory canals in the pith of the stem—a very
uncommon feature in which the genera Ginkgo and Cephalotawus agree—has been
emphasised by VAN TreGHeEM (18914, p. 189), as a sign of affinity.


292 PROF. BIRBAL SAHNI ON THE STRUCTURE AND

The position adopted by several writers, such as R. B. THomson (1905, pp. 45 and
54), Lawson (1907, p. 20), Coutrer and CHAMBERLAIN (1917, p. 418), and Briss
(1918, p. 56), that the Yews represent a relatively modern group, appears to be
untenable in view of the evidence from the morphology of the male and female
organs, specially the presence of bracts in the male cone and the structure of the
seed.
