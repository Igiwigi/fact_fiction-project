It will be seen that in three cases out of the four here considered the effect of the
mutual gravitation of the waters is to increase the ratio of the tide to the equilibrium
tide. In two of the cases the sign is also reversed. This of course results from

the fact that, whereas when p/c) = 0°18093 one of the periods of free oscillation is
