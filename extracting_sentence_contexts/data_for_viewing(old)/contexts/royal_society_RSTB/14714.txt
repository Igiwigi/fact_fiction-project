Received: 31 March 2022 with very basic stereoscopic algorithms which make no attempt to achieve

fusion or correspondence, or to produce even a coarse map of depth across
the visual field. This may explain why some aspects of insect stereopsis
seem poorly designed from an engineering point of view: for example,
