on Venus and our earth, it could not, considering the greater
rarity of its atmosphere, be so considerable: and that the
vestiges of it, allowing for the brightness of the luminous part
of the moon, the strong light that is thence thrown upon the
field of the telescope, and in some measure the reflected light
