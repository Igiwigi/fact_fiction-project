Moreover, there is now
good evidence to suggest that exposure to pollutants can
induce effects that transcend generations by causing develop-
mental changes that are epigenetic [79]. For example, in
laboratory mice, exposure to an endocrine disruptor affects
female mating preferences three generations removed from
the actual exposure [80]. Such studies underscore the fact
that exposure to pollutants need not even be permanent to
exert long-lasting effects on the mate choice process. In addition, greater emphasis needs to be given to under-
standing the impact of pollutants in interaction with other
environmental stressors. In the wild, animals are typically
confronted with a myriad of environmental challenges simul-
taneously (from both natural and anthropogenic sources).
