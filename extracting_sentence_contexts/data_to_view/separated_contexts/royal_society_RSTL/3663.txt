We further conclude, —
r= 4. That the tendency to absorption through increasing thicknesses of air is a di-
minishing one. That in fact the absorption almost certainly reaches a limit, beyond
-2 which no further loss will take place þy an increased thickness of similar atmospheric
Z ingredients. That the residual heat (tested by the absorption into a blue liquor) may
5 amount to from a half to a third of that which reaches the surface of the globe after
= a vertical transmission through a clear atmosphere. 2 5, That the law of absorption in a clear and dry atmosphere, equivalent to between
= one and four times the mass of air traversed vertically, may be represented (within
Z those limits) by an intensity diminisbing in a geometrical progression, plus a constant
= quantity, which is the limiting value already mentioned.
