(a) Why we need to define embryonic-extraembryonic boundaries

Agreed terminology and their unambiguous definition are critical in ensuring
clarity when discussing concepts. For developmental biologists, this is all the
more important, to avoid confusion and misunderstanding, especially in an
age when artificial ‘embryos’ and embryonic components can be generated ex
vivo [4-10]. An appreciation of how specific terminology came into being is
also important for interpreting the wealth of information in historic texts that
form the foundation for modern developmental biology. Further, it can be rel-
evant to philosophical discussions on the individuality of the embryo and
helps to anchor what might otherwise be metaphysical definitions of our indivi-
duality in empirical facts of early embryonic development [11,12]. Here, we will
outline how the way in which we define the boundaries (both categorical and
anatomical) between the embryonic and extraembryonic has shifted throughout
