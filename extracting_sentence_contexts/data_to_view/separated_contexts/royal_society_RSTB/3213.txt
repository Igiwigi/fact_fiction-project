VeEsQuz| was the first to observe the waxing and waning of the air-bubbles in the
vessels according to the relative gain or loss of water by the stem, and he concluded,
in fact, that the main function of the vessels is to act as reservoirs for water, and
that they conduct only under special conditions. He also erroneously concluded
that the resistance to a given velocity of flow is proportional, ceteris paribus, to the
fourth power of the radius, whereas it is proportional to the square of the radius and
the volume passing to the fourth power. In any case, the bubbles in the vessels
always appear under a pressure of less than an atmosphere, and hence arises the fact,
as shown by Von Hounet, that, when actively transpiring branches are cut under
mercury, the latter is usually drawn up into the vessels in spite of its capillary
depression. The latter is given by Von H6uNEL' as— '
