The actual concomitants can be obtained by building tableaux for consecutive degrees
in the coefficients, such that each tableau is of the required type. Thus for the alternating
invariant of 10 quaternary quadrics the tableau is

The product of five determinants corresponding to this tableau gives only one term in
the required invariant. With concomitants of a single ground form one term is sufficient,
for the fact that the ground forms are made identical is equivalent to the operation of the
symmetric group of permutations on the ground forms. If instead of a concomitant of
degree nin one ground form we sought a concomitant which was linear in each of Â» ground
forms and symmetric in these ground forms, it would be necessary to operate with the
symmetric group of permutations on these ground forms.

Similarly, to obtain the alternating invariant of 10 quaternary quadrics we must operate
on the term given above with the negative symmetric group on the LO quadrics.

Actually the 10! terms so obtained are not all required, as the given term already has the
alternating property with respect to many permutations.

Turnbull & Young (1926) have shown that the alternating invariant of 10 quadrics can
