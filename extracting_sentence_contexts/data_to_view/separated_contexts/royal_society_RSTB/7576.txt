What seems to be under-emphasized here is that long-range movement, no matter to what
degree controlled en route, rarely occurs unless the insects’ behaviour contributes in some
positive way to it, and that it is the making of this contribution, not the mechanism of their
horizontal displacement, which distinguishes the insects biologically as migrants. Displacement
may be active or passive, but ‘passive migration’ is a contradiction in terms. There is, in fact, wide variation in the degree to which migrants traverse the ground
through their own exertions, or on the wind. The variation is continuous and its causes need
to be studied; whereas it tends to be left on one side when migration is regarded either as
essentially active, or as essentially passive. The antithesis between ‘active’ and ‘passive’
migration is misleading, for it gives primary importance to a biologically secondary matter:
the particular means of traversing the ground, employed by migrants.
