Using narrow beam X-rays it has been reported that the spherulites in polyamides have
a decided texture and ‘that the molecular chains lie in planes round the centre of the
spherulite like the skins of an onion, and in such a way that the plane of the zigzag chain
lies in these planes, whilst, moreover, every position is achievable’ (Brenschede 1949).

It was difficult to visualize a mechanism of growth which could lead to a radiating
fibrous appearance, a tangential disposition of the molecules and an ‘onion-like’ structure.
In the case of crystals growing in polymers the crystallizing units are segments of long
molecules and the addition of segments to the crystal phase is very much conditioned by
what has gone on before and the state of order in the segments of the chains near the
crystallizing surface. An isolated small crystal growing in a randomly arranged long-
chain polymeric system can in the first place be expected to have a faster rate of growth
along the direction of the chain owing to the fact that in this direction there are far more
chains already in suitable juxtaposition for propagation of the crystal growth. Growth of
radiating fibrils from the nucleation point on this picture of the mechanism of the growth
will not on first sight result in a tangential disposition of the molecules. One possibility is
that at an early stage in the development of the spherulite, sheaf-like growth develops into
layer growth after the ends of the sheaves meet at the equator of the structure. This layer
or laminar growth would lead to a tangential disposition of the molecules and an ‘onion-
like’ structure, but will not explain the radiating fibrous appearance of the spherulitic

structures, nor will it result in a constant radial rate of growth of the spherulite. It was
therefore necessary to reinvestigate the structures of spherulites in polymers in order to
resolve these difficulties. This more detailed investigation has now been carried out and is
described in a later paper (see also Keller 1952). It has been demonstrated that the structure
