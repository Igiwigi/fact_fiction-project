x 3, from the holotype. The holotype, which at first sight suggests a spherical form, has been somewhat
distorted, but there is no doubt that here again the mouth is excentric. We can deduce from the fossil remains two important facts: (1) that the test was
thinner than in either Aulechinus or Ectinechinus; (2) that the test was elongate, with
mouth and anus at opposite poles very much as in Ectinechinus. The reconstructions (figs. 14A,B) are based on the above deductions. Dorsally
the form is made to resemble Ectinechinus except that the ambulacra have stronger
curves and the valves of the anus are fewer and stouter.
