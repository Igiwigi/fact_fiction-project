(5.) In addition to the above, the whole mass of results to be detailed in this and
the succeeding chapters is convincing evidence of the truth of our interpretation,
since, as will be seen by separating the fibres in the two sides of the cord (longitudinal
section), by interrupting the fibres on one side only (hemisection), &c., we obtained a
differentiation in our results which admits of no other explanation than the one
upon which we base our deductions, namely, that the electrical effects observed are
due to changes localised in the exposed cord, and, moreover, in the experiments
under discussion localised particularly in the nerve fibres which form the pyramidal
tracts. The fact above alluded to of the absence of electrical effects in the dorsal cord when
the area for the upper limb was excited in the Monkey, involves matters of such
importance that we now pass on to consider it in some detail. (c.) Lhe Localisation of Efferent Representation in the Cortex as ascertained by the
