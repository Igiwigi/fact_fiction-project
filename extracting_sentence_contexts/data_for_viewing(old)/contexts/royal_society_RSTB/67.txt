Shows double variation of spontaneously-beating Frog’s ventricle.

The electrical phases are in opposite direction at beginning and at end of beat; first phase, base negative
to apex ; second phase, apex negative to base.

A simultaneous record is made of the movements of a lever resting on the ventricle. (Apex to H,SO,,
variation SN.)

that a double variation seen by the galvanometer is also seen and recorded to be
double by the electrometer (Photos. 1 and 2); they showed further, as we expected,
that a variation seen as simple with the galvanometer could be shown to be composed
of two phases when the electrometer was put in circuit instead of the galvanometer.
The fact, however, for which our previous experiments had not prepared us, was that

* We also obtained the diphasic variation of a single twitch of the Frog’s gastrocnemius excited hy an
induction shock.

the electromotive change accompanying the beat of the ventricle is not always

composed of two phases, it is sometimes expressed in its photograph as a single

variation (Photos. 8 and 4). This then is the fact ; our opinion concerning it is that,
