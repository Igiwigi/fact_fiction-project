of 15.1mmolm~> when averaged over 2000-5000 m. On the contrary, the upper ocean shows a
clear deoxygenation signal with a loss of oxygen reaching 31.9mmolm~> when averaged over
200-600m and between 20°S and 20°N. Overall, the glacial ocean is simulated to be less
oxygenated than at MH, with an average oxygen concentration lower by 5.8mmolm~°.

When the multi-proxy data compilation of Jaccard & Galbraith [17] is plotted on top of the
simulated changes (figure 3), the overall comparison is rather satisfying, with the same contrast
between the upper and deep oceans. If we consider the 68 records that display a significant
trend (increase or decrease) from the LGM to the MH, the model reproduces the same trend for
48 of them (i.e. for 76% of the core locations). The main mismatches are located in the North
Pacific, where the model simulates an oxygenation trend northward of 40°N opposite to the
deoxygenation signal from the proxy records, and in the northern Indian Ocean (in fact in the
Arabian Sea), where the model simulates a deoxygenation trend opposite to a clear oxygenation
signal from the data. Note that all coarse resolution models have difficulties in reproducing low
oxygen concentrations for the present day in these two regions (see [3] for CMIP5 models, and
[39] for IPSL-CM5A-LR specifically).

(b) Major role of ventilation changes

As for the projected trends and for the simulated short variability (§3), we decompose the O
change signal into its AOz<.at and AAOU components (figure 4 for the Pacific Ocean; electronic
supplementary material, figure S3, for the other basins). From the LGM to the MH, O2sat decreases
by 74mmolm~ on average and for the global ocean, in line with a global ocean warming of 1°C.
At the surface (0-50 m), the ocean warms by 2°C and Oo¢at decreases by 10.4mmol m3. In the
