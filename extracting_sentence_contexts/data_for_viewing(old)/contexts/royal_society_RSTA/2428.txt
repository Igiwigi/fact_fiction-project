solutions to the FP equation for the DLE at steady state.

This renewed interest stems, in part, from the technological advances in a variety of biological
areas, bringing empirical observations with ever-increasing temporal resolution. The improved
resolution in the data, combined with the ever-present uncertainties or inability to construct first-
principle models of biological phenomena, has made apparent the need for a general framework
to represent non-Markov stochastic processes. The equivalence between an LE and FP description
is at the heart of that development.

Following the approach of Budini & Caceres, one of the present authors has shown in [29]
the importance of constructing joint-probability distribution functions (PDF) to represent non-
Markov stochastic processes compared to Markov cases. The joint probability distribution is
in fact necessary to construct the conditional probability distribution, which is the bona fide
representation of the random process. Following on from ref. [30], an FP representation for the
one-time and two-time PDF has been developed to construct the conditional PDF for a DLE [31].

Despite these recent findings for linear non-Markov systems, the formulation of an FP
description of nonlinear, non-Markov processes remains an open problem. Our interest here is
to review these recent studies and present some new results for (linear) DLE, and at the same
time to set the stage for tackling the more general problem of a probabilistic representation of
nonlinear, non-Markov systems.

The paper is organized as follows. In ยง2 we consider the general problem of a delayed
nonlinear Langevin equation and show the infinite hierarchy of FP equations that can be
constructed from it. In ยง3, we present the DLE, we review the solution method and the
