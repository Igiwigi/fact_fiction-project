If the rate of damage of a specimen
is indeed diffusion limited, then it may be possible to use a higher electron flux (as in STEM) to
obtain a better SNR for a given level of damage. This analysis assumes that the flux in low-dose
CTEM corresponds to the linear portion of the schematic in figure 4a and the localized STEM
probe flux relates to the region at which the dose rate versus damage rate curve plateaus and
hence the damage per unit fluence (i.e. the gradient of the curve) is lower. Here, we also note that damage is in fact delocalized around the STEM probe (figure 4b),
typically over a radius of 3-5nm for the low energy electronic excitations responsible for

Figure 5. (a) A comparison between high-resolution 300 kV CTEM (1-3) and STEM (4-9) imaging of calcite nanoparticles. STEM 3
BF imaging was able to detect a lattice at higher fluences than was possible in CTEM. However, this was found to be due to the fa
contamination deposited during STEM imaging, as when the contamination was removed (7—9), STEM imaging caused more DB
severe specimen degradation than CTEM, converting the specimen to calcium oxide at a lower fluence. (b) Comparison of 0 : Ca : 3
atomic ratios extracted from time-resolved CTEM EDX spectra from both a contaminated and (cleaned) uncontaminated calcite 2
