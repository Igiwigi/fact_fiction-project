The curve © is the system of the »—2 tangents
from P to the curve; each tangent has with the curve a single intersection at P, that is,
k=n—2; each tangent besides meets the curve in the point of contact Q' twice, and in
(m—3) points P'; hence if (a, «, «) refer to the points (P, Q'), and (27, B, Þ') to the
points (P, P'), we have

2{a—«—&} +{2r—8—Þ8'} + Supp. =2(n—2)D. From the foregoing example the value of a—«—«' is =4D—zx. In the case where the
point P is at a cusp, then the »—2 tangents become the n—3 tangents from the cusp,
and the tangent at the cusp; hence the curve © meets the given curve in 2(4—3)+3,
=24—3 points, that is, (@—2)+(2—1) points; this does not prove (ante, No. 96), but
the fact is, that the cusp counts in the Supplement (2 —1) times, and the expression of
the Supplement is =(n—1)z. It is clear that we have p=PB'=(n—2)(m—3), 80 that
the equation is
8D—2z+2r—2(n—2)(m—3)+(n—1)z=(n—2)2D,

2r=2(n—2)(m—3)+(n—6)2D+(—n+3)z;
or substituting for 2D its value =n— 2m+2+zx and reducing, this is
s 2r=w+8m—10n— 3x,

that is,

which is right.

and the point Q on a given curve of the order m/ have an («, «') correspondence, and let
