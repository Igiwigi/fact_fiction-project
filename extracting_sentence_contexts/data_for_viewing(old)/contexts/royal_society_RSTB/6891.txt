The mechanism of molecular contortion visualized by Astbury? as a result of X-ray
analysis of keratin and other substances is graphically indicated in the diagram repro-
duced here as text-fig. 1. Convolution of the molecular thread is represented as due
to the mutual attraction, either electrical or chemical, of side-chains known to project

* It is important to notice that the conception of a submicroscopic convolution is introduced here
to account for the facts of chromosome elasticity. It should not be thought of as an explanation of spiral
structure, the physical basis of which is quite unknown.

t It should perhaps be pointed out that Astbury’s work has already entered cytology in a paper by
Naithani (1937) referred to in the footnote to p. 188 above. Naithani’s suggestion was that a molecular
change of the f-a keratin type might underlie the post-pachytene chromosome shorlening recognized
by Belling and Sax, but gave no facts of any kind to support it. In the light of what has been shown
for Osmunda this suggestion would seem to be highly improbable and the post-pachytene shortening in
Osmunda will be dealt with here under the heading of supercontraction.

out from the bodies of the long molecules.* This attraction is suggested on the diagram
by the addition of + and — signs to the side-chains, though it is realized that such
signs are primarily symbolic and do not imply precise knowledge of the physical basis
of attraction. Now it is clear that, if such a convoluted molecule is straightened by
