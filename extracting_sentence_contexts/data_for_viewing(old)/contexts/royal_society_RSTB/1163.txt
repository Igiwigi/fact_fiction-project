In these experiments, it is seen that the right lateral column was excluded from
the section, and that stimulation of no other column above the section, except the right
lateral, produced any nerve effect.

It has, however, been shown in Chapter IX. that when impulses proceed up the
posterior roots into the evord they are conveyed to some extent (20 per cent.) by the
lateral columns of the same side. A connection between the posterior root fibres and
the lateral column, presumably by means of fibres in the posterior column or cornu,
must therefore exist. This connection is, however, of such a special kind that it
offers an evident resistance to the passage of impulses backwards from the cord into
the root. The fact that no effects in the above experiment could be obtained when,
with the lateral column as the gole bridge between the excited upper portion of
the cord and the nerves, the posterior columns were excited, shows that any spread
of path from the posterior to the lateral columns, if it exists, must either be below
the level of the section (12th dorsal) or must offer a resistance â€œto the passage of
impulses in the downward direction which it does not offer to their passage in the
upward direction, that is, in their ascent towards higher centres.

The relations which the cord columns appear to have -with one another, as given in
the summary of Chapter VIIL., are in this respect of great interest and importance.

Two results are clearly brought out by the consideration of the series of experiments
in the whole of this section; the first that the analogous character of the general
