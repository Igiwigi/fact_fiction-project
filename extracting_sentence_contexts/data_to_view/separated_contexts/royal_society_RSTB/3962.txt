Ina recent paper (‘ Journ. of Physiol.,’ XLIL, p. 337, 1911) Livpuarp concludes, from experiments on
three persons, that (1) the sensibility of the respiratory centre to changes in the alveolar CO, pressure is
normally far less than HALDANE and Priestiey find ; and (2) that the excitability of the centre hy CO.
is governed by the alveolar oxygen pressure, in such a way that an increase or diminution of the normal
alveolar oxygen pressure makes the centre more, or less, excitable to a given increase above normal in
the alveolar CO, pressure. He regards HALDANE and PRIESTLEY’s results as probably due to the fact
that the oxygen percentage in the air which they inspired while making their experiments was somewhat
diminished owing to vitiation with expired air. The same line of reasoning and experiment has been
further developed in a still more recent paper by HAsseLpaLcu and Linpuarp (‘Skand. Archiv fiir
Physiol.,’ XXV., p. 361, 1912).
