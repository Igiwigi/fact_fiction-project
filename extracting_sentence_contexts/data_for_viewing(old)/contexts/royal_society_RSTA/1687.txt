more remote goal. Direct detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background is plagued
by instrumental noise [23], and predicted spectral distortions of the relic photon background
radiation are seen against immense far infrared foregrounds. We can still be optimistic about
feasibility, in large part because we have been here before in terms of overcoming foregrounds.
The unprecedented limits on infinitesimal deviations from a blackbody reported by the COBE
FIRAS experiment and the further refinements projected with CMB-S4 and proposed space
experiments highlight a new pathway for future exploration.

There are many papers on generating spectral distortions in the early universe: for example, by
decaying dark matter, evaporating primordial black holes, and even more exotic phenomenology.
However, it is frustrating to realize that there are no guaranteed cosmological signals for such
exotica. Hence exploration of the unknown becomes difficult to justify when in competition
with missions that advertise guaranteed science goals. This is despite the fact that the historical
record demonstrates that such a new horizon approach is an invaluable part of humanityâ€™s drive
to explore the universe with the prospect of vast but unforeseeable returns. In fact by being
sufficiently ambitious, guaranteed science central to cosmology is achievable via a CMB spectral
distortion experiment.

More specifically, spectral distortions provide a unique window that exposes the physics of the
very early universe, and provide a fundamental test of the Big Bang theory, if one can overcome
the various foregrounds. Sources of spectral distortion arise in the pre-recombination and post-
recombination epochs where spectral distortions emerge as a combination [24] of late epoch y-
distortions [25] and early epoch j-distortions [26] in the standard ACDM model, along with a
transition phase [27].
