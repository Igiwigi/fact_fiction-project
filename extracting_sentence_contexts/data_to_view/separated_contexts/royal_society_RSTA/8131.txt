Hence, in order to refer this batch to
the permanent reference mean 4 microvolts must be added for this date. Using the
known age of 8 months and finding by analysis of other readings that + = 0-75, the
point (8-75, ++ 4) can be marked and a line parallel to the others drawn, thus giving
the em.f. of the batch both for the past and for the future. When the ageing
graph has been recaptured several times in this way to within 1 or 2 microvolts, inde-
pendently by the use of different batches, confidence in the whole method of procedure

* The facts that the cells are not all quite the same age and that they vary slightly in their values of +,

can be shown to lead to a negligible error at this age in the case of these cells, provided that the average
age and the average value of + are used. THE AGEING OF STANDARD CELLS. 161

is strikingly justified. When the writer first attempted to disentangle the web of
differences in such cases as this and to trace the ageing, it was expected to find variations
of many microvolts between the results of different routes of attack, but in only rare
instances do diserepancies exceed 5 microvolts.
