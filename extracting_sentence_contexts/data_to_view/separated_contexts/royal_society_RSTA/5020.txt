It should be noted, however, that the metallic C12A7:e~ undergoes the superconducting
transition (SCT) at approximately 0.2 K at ambient pressure. This fact is apparently incompatible
with a well-known fact that an s-band metal of alkali and alkaline earth metals does not exhibit
SCT at ambient pressure but some of them become superconducting [15,20-23] through the
pressure-induced change with the exception of lithium which has a very low T, (0.4mK) at
ambient pressure [24]. This fact implies the existence of an unrevealed mechanism to explain
the emergence of superconductivity in metallic C12A7:e~. In this paper, we report how the
sub-nanometer-sized cage network structure of C12A7:e~ is responsible for the emergence
of superconductivity, based on comparison with the pressure-induced superconductivity of
conventional s-band alkali metals. An insight into superconductors is addressed with a close
correspondence in crystal and electronic structures between superconductors of C12A7:e~ and
high-pressure phases of s-band alkali metals.
