0'244-+40°081 and for adult measurements 0°598+0°097, The numbers of
individuals on which these coefficients are founded are, of course, very small, but
their significant values—especially of the second—suffice to make it highly probable
that the remaining four clones were still not included in a single biotype. Beyond
this it is not safe to go, as the numbers were too small and transgressive
fluctuation too great to justify an attempt to decide whether indeed each clone
had not a distinct genotypical constitution. We can, however, say with some
confidence that at least three genotypes were represented among the five clones of the
small strain.

This is very suggestive of the enormous genetic diversity existing not only within
a single species but within a given population of a species inhabiting a restricted
and continuous area. The fact, however, must not be lost sight of that, in the
absence of segregation, heterozygous genotypes retain their individuality, and
therefore a ‘greater diversity may be expected to reveal itself here than in a self-
fertilising or closely inbred sexual population.

Comparison with the Monoclonal Population.

As we have seen, the monoclonal. population was descended from 70 original
ancestors, themselves all descended parthenogenetically from a single known female.
One of these 70 failed to leave offspring beyond Generation 1 and is left out of
consideration, leaving 69 original ancestors of the population. Each of these became
the ancestor of a separate line, of which two sub-lines a and b were bred, giving
in Generations 1-5 138 sub-lines in all (except where temporarily reduced by death
