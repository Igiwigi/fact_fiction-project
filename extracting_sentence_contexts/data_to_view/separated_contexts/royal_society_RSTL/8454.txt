8 were merely d6bris of such a membrane. In Rhynchodemus these
cells may often be observed uncontracted and of an oval form, and containing two or
three rod-like bodies (Plate XI. fig. 2), in fact in every way resembling the rod-cells
described from ordinary aquatic Planarians. On treatment with potash, the cells of
Bipalium swell up (Plate XI. fig. 4), are seen to contain rod-like bodies, and the fine
filament at the upper extremity appears like a duct leading to the surface of the base-
ment membrane.
