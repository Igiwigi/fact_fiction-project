equation (2.7) always exists and is uniform in phenotype space W (u) = Wo. But
the natural solution may lose positivity or even cease to exist depending on the
properties of G and K. For example, when both G(u) and K(u) are of the form
equation (2.2) with p= 2, the inverse Fourier transform of equation (2.7) exists
when the carrying capacity has a value of o larger than the kernel G, but not in
the opposite case.

Figure 1 shows stationary solutions attained at long times by the dynamics
in equation (1.2) illustrating the situations described above, starting from a
smooth non-vanishing initial condition. In the first case we choose a kernel
and carrying capacity functions (G(u) = gu), K(u)=sech(u/o)), such that
the natural solution exists and is positive everywhere. Thus it is stable,
and it is the steady state attained at long times. In fact it can be analytically
calculated,

Ww (uw) = a7! sechÂ®(u/o). (2.8)

In the second case the non-positiveness of the kernel used (with a carrying
capacity of the type equation (2.2)) breaks down the initial configuration into
umps, which at long times approach zero-width delta functions with forbidden
zones in between. In the third case, despite G, being positive, a positive natural
solution does not exist. Several outcomes are possible but, for the kernel and
capacity used, the system approaches a single hump solution which vanishes in
yart of the niche space.
