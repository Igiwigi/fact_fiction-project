F which might seem, & priori, the more probable. In favour of the second hypothesis,
and against the first, there are certain facts which are too important to be overlooked. In the first place Trczrstepr* found, on severing the auricles from the ventricles in
Rabbits, by means of his “ atriotome,” that the ventricles at once pass on to the slowed
but regular rhythm which is due to their intrinsic mechanism, and that there is no
such temporary arrest of the ventricles as is produced by strong vagus excitation. That the severance of the auricles from the ventricles was complete in his experiment
was shown by the fact that, after the atriotome had been applied no further slowing
