the cavities of the grains, and which, when immersed in
water, instantly dissolved, and displayed in the field of the
microscope, hundreds of perfectly organized, extremely mi-
nute worms, all which, in less than a quarter of an hour, were
in lively motion.

Having left some of these worms on a glass for five days
in a perfectly dry state, they were apparently dead; but
when moistened, they were again, in less than half an hour,
as lively as ever.

These experiments and results were 50 far satisfactory, as
they incontestibly established the fact, that [the fibrous sub-
stance within the cavities of the diseased wheat grains, con-
8ists of real organized animals, which are endowed with the
extraordinary property, of having their muscular action sus-
pended for a considerable length of time, and of having it
renewed again by the mere application of moisture : but how
these animals are propagated, and how they are introduced

into the cavities of the young germens, appeared tome a mys-
tery, which I was convinced could only be unravelled by
tracing them through every stage of the germination and
