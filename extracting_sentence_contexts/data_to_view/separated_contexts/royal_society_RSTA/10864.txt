This result, therefore, confirms the
explanation already given of the discharging action of the rays. In a recent paper
by Lenarpf this charging action of the cathode rays in a high vacuum was described,
but its connection with the ionized air surrounding the electrode was not brought
out. From the experiments just described it is clear that, while this action is directly
due to the fact that the cathode rays carry a negative charge, the extent of the effect
obtained in all cases depends to a very great degree upon the opposing influence
exerted by the ionized air surrounding the electrode upon which the rays fall.

4, Ionization not due to Rintgen Rays. It has been thought by some that the ionization produced by eathode rays was due
to Réntgen rays, which might possibly be sent out from tne window at the same
time. The results of experiment are, however, entirely opposed to this view.
