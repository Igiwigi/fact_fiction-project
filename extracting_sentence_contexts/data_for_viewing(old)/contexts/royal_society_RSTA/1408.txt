using a local low rank regularization. As a subspace basis, the four lowest order Fourier modes
were chosen. Figure 8 shows the reconstructed complex-valued coefficient maps from which a
composite image can be computed in a root-sum-squares manner (top). Additionally, synthesized
bSSFP images are computed for four virtual frequency offsets (bottom) in which the distribution
of signal voids is given by the phase distribution of the subspace coefficients. These synthesized
bSSFP images correspond to conventional bSSFP images acquired with four different phase
cycles.

5. Discussion

In the past decades, various techniques were developed to accelerate quantitative MRI. One
very general way is to exploit complementary information from spatially distinct receiver
coils, called parallel imaging (PI) [55-57]. Others make use of the fact that MR images are
usually sparse in a certain transform domain and combined with incoherent sampling and
nonlinear image reconstruction algorithms it is called compressed sensing (CS) [58]. Exploiting
this prior knowledge about a compressible image, CS can recover MR images from highly
undersampled data [59,60]. Other approaches combine PI and CS with efficient non-Cartesian
sampling schemes [60].

When it comes to parameter mapping, besides the already mentioned sparsity constraints,
low-rank constraints or joint sparsity can also be exploited along the parameter dimension to
accelerate the acquisition [14,16,61-63].

Generally speaking, the methods above usually consist of two steps: first reconstruction of
contrast-weighted images from undersampled datasets and second, the subsequent voxel-by-
