generalizing about physical space beyond our direct experience was a valid means of knowledge
construction [26].

Thus Riemann’s ideas of geometry challenged not only the belief that Euclidean was the one
true geometry, but also the certainty that science could arrive at a universal physical truth that
transcended experience [27,28]. They became widely known after Helmholtz’s promotion of them
in 1868, and William Kingdom Clifford’s 1873 translation of Riemann [29,30]. Geometry could
no longer be founded on self-evidently true axioms that were not open to physical questioning.
Instead, geometries were based on metrical considerations that could be empirically investigated.
The empiricist response was to consider the axioms of both mechanics and geometry as true only
to the extent that they were supported by experience until now.

Gravitational action at a distance had been adopted by Newton as an empirically verified fact,
standing in until such time as a more satisfactory and fundamental theory of locally acting forces
could be developed. On astronomical scales, where the size of celestial bodies could be considered
insignificant compared to the distances between them and constraints were not important, the
assumption of action at a distance in Euclidean space according to a central force governed by
an inverse square law worked well. Through the eighteenth century, driven by a desire to reduce
the discrepancy between astronomical observations and Newtonian mechanics, mathematicians


such as Euler, d’Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace had developed techniques of approximation
and variation which allowed them to handle many-body problems. These efforts culminated
triumphantly with the publication of Laplace’s Traité de mécanique celeste in 1798-1825 [31].
However, as well as being an unexplained and hence occult force, the assumption of action
