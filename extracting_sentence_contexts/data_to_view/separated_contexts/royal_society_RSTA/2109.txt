Third, the coupling may be asymmetric. Fourth,
the oscillators may be slightly non-identical. The phase equation including all these facts will take
the form

ba = Wala) +€ > Gap. (bar bp) + (= CO, aba bp) + YG, alas bp, by ) +++ (3.43)

To integrate all such complex situations into the theory would not be a difficult matter if we do

not mind lengthy calculations. Omitting all calculational details, we arrive at the final form of

phase reduction

da = 04 +€ D> M(ba — 6) + 2 (= PP) ba — 68) + CP ba — O16 — 7) te. GAs)

Finally, one may wonder if there is any practical use of the theory of higher-order phase

reduction.
