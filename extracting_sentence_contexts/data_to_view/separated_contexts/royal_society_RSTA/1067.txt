‘The classical frame of concepts’ may appear to refer to the concepts of classical physics, and
in part it does. However, by this time (in 1949), Bohr adopts a view that comes close to the
strong RWR-type view. As his said in his 1937 article, cited above, we are not ‘any longer in
a position to speak of the autonomous behaviour of a [quantum] physical object’.
