[PLaTE 39.] Towarps a knowledge of the generative economy of the Spiny Monotreme (Fehidna
Tyswriz, Cuv.) the recorded steps are the following :—

The fact of its posxessing mammary but teat-less glands, as in the Ornithorhynehus ;*
that these glands acquired large and functional development concomitant with ovarian
indications of recent gestation ;# that the lacteal areola became lodged in a tegumentary
depression or quas! pouch, capable of receiving the head and fore limbs of the young,
at least when this was not more than 1 inch 10 lines in total length. The female Zcladna and her young, the snbjects of the paper of 1865, were taken
in Lolac Forest, Victoria, Australia, on the 12th August, 1864. Guided thereby, I
noted, in correspondence with friends in localities frequented by the Echidne, the
period when females in the impregnated state might be obtained, with instructions as t0
the parts to be preserved and transmitted, in alcohol, for examination ; noting, also, the
chief facts which remained to be determined in reference to the suhject of the present
communieation, Among such friendly correspondents I have the good fortune to
include GxorGe FReDerTo BxxNerve, E8q.,
