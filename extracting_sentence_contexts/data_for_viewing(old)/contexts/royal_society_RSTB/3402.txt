The Proportion of the Sexes produced by Legitimate and Illegitimate Unions at
Times of Highest and Lowest Fertility, as compared with the Average Proportion.

In Table V it was shown that there is a consistent difference between the proportion
of M. born from legitimate as compared with illegitimate unions, in both white and
coloured races, for each of the three years under review; and the inference was
drawn (p. 290) that the forces which induce that difference act differently on the
two races.

In the last section this inference was shown to be justified for births as a whole,
and when the figures for legitimate and illegitimate births for the periods of highest
and lowest birth-rates are separately examined the same fact is again demonstrated.

I have presented these results in Table VIII. It is there seen that the proportion
of M. is higher during the months of lowest fertility than during the breeding seasons
in both legitimate and illegitimate births; this is true for both races, but the
difference is greater for coloured than it is for whites.

It is also shown that the proportion of F. is always higher for illegitimate than it
is for legitimate births during both these seasons for both races; but whereas the
difference is greatest during the months of highest birth-rate for whites it is greatest
during the months of lowest birth-rate for coloured people.

This variation is capable of the same interpretation already advanced regarding the
