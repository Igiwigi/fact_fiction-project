THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE=PRODUCING MEMBERS. 207

genous group, Similarly, in the larger sporangia of the Marattiaces, it originates
from the wall; in the smaller sporangia of the Leptosporangiate Ferns, from the
central cell (archesporium ?), Again, in Ophioglossum, with its large sporangia, there
is no.definite tapetum, in JZelminthostachys and Botrychium there is a tapetum
derived outside the sporogenous group. These facts support the general statement
that indefinite and nonspecialised nutritive arrangements are characteristic of larger
sporangia, but more definite tapetal layers are found in the smaller; and further, that
while in sporangia of relatively large size the tapetum may originate outside the

S the sporogenous cell or cell-group. A progressive change such as this last was
8 suggested by Lane,* as a possible explanation of the results observed by him in the
& microsporangia of Stangeria; a functional tapetum is there derived from the
& sporogenous group; outside this two layers derived from the surrounding tissue
Q resembles the tapetum of the Marattiacesw in position, but do not take the tapetal

arisen from the latter.” In the microsporangia of the Gymnosperms there seems to
