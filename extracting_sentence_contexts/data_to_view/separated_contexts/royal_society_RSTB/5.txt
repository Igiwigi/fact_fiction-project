24 (n and r) are not at first sight quite intelligible, until more careful search
results in the discovery that the empty conidia, &c., are still attached ; in other cases,
however, the remains of the conidia become destroyed (e.g., by bacteria, &c.), and the
delicate hyphze containing the protoplasm persist alone. I have excellent reasons for
believing that such hyphze are not necessarily dead, and that the presence of certain
fine hyphze on the leaves is to be explained as above. First, however, it will be advisable to see what occurs when the conidia are ger-
minating in a drop of water on the leaf of the living Ranunculus, and where the
increased supply of oxygen may be one of several causes for the fact stated aboveâ€”
that the conidia germinate more rapidly. In figs. 26 and 27 are shown several specimens of germinating conidia, which had
been sown in drops of dew on the living leaf, the plant being kept in a cool green-
house under a glass bell-jar.
