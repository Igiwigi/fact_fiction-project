facts which T have adduced justify us in reconsidering the whole theory of rhythm as
due to ganglia.

(k.) As I have already said, I am not inclined to deny that there is probably some
truth in the current theory of rhythm as due to ganglia ; I merely wish to point ont,
distinctly that this theory is inadequate, and that in order to cover all the facts, it
will require to be snpplemented by the theory which I now propose. The current
theory of rhythm as due to ganglia attributes the whole of the effect to the gan-
glionic element, and thus fails to meet the facts of a rhythm which is artificially
produced after the ganglionic element has been removed. It also fails to meet a
number of other facts of the firs} importance. For it is beyond all doubt that
rhythmic action of the strictes> kind occurs in an innumerable multitude of -cases
where it is quite impossible to suppose anything resembling ganglia to be present.
