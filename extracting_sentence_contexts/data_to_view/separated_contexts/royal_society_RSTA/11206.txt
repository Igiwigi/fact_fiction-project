At moderately high temperatures therefore, when palla-
dium can still absorb a considerable quantity of hydrogen, we should expect a more
rapid diffusion through, or permeation of, the foil, and consequently the production
of a spongy or fissured mass, caused by expansion on the occlusion of just as much
hydrogen as can be retained at this temperature, so that on cooling down to the
ordinary temperature the foil ought to behave more nearly like palladium sponge. At this stage an exact measurement of the total quantity of hydrogen absorbed
was made, and it was found that 94:50 cub. centims., or 851 volumes, had been taken
up by the palladium foil. That the absorption at 100° was complete was shown by the fact that on raising
the temperature to 100° C. about 100 volumes of gas were expelled, and of this about
three-quarters was reabsorbed on cooling down to the ordinary temperature, whilst
the remainder, along with seven additional volumes, was occluded on standing for
eighteen hours. The final measurement showed that 95°18 cub. centims., or 858
volumes, of hydrogen had been absorbed. Just as palladium foil which has been rendered more or less spongy in texture
requires a considerable time for the absorption of its quantum of hydrogen, so also
it gives off its occluded gas extremely slowly in vacuo at the ordinary temperature.
