H. CHURCH ON THE FLORAL MECHANISM OF WELWITSCHIA MIRABILIS. 137

turn be replaced by commissural stigmas (Cruciferee, Liliwm) and other secondary
stigmatic regions, it is sufficiently obvious that under xerophytic stress, in highly
specialised Gymnosperm phyla, the functionless megasporophyll would be rapidly
reduced and would soon entirely vanish, leaving its limiting single residual ovule
alone in its place. The fact that such loss of the megasporophyll had taken place
in the Paleozoic age (Cordaites), in the Mesozoic (Cycadeoidea), as well as in modern
Taxoids, shows that Welwitschia is not particularly exceptional in this respect. Its special significance and value is that it presents a reduction of the gyncecium
to the absolute minimum in a floral structure that also contains an androecium, and
was once presumably hermaphrodite. In this it is unique.
