While, however, it follows automatically that non-causal behaviour, considered at the level
of a given model, cannot be handled deterministically, the reverse is not true. The underlined
qualification is necessary because we can have causal models of processes in nature that may not
be ultimately causal. The fact that the causal models of classical physics apply and are effective
within the proper limits of classical physics does not mean that the ultimate character of the actual
processes that are responsible for classical phenomena is causal. They may not be, for example,
by virtue of their ultimately quantum nature. Nor, conversely, does the non-causal character of a
model, for example, that of quantum mechanics in the present interpretation, guarantee that the
ultimate nature of reality is non-causal.
