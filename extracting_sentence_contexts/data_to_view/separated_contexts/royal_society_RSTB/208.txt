% The experiment shows that the secondary response attains its maximum 1 /100”
# after that of the primary, and that it is independent of the direction of the exciting
'€ induction shock.

be Tn all the preceding experiments the second apex occurs at about 1 /100” after that
g of the primary response. This fact, together with the fact that the current of the
{primary response itself excites a strip when led through it, justifies the conclusion
E that the second rise is a true secondary response excited by the rise of the primary ; A but, as the tissue when excited by an induction shock has been shown in Part I. to
attain the maximum of its response in rather less than 1/100”, it seemed advisable to
devise an experiment which would clearly demonstrate that this second rise noticed
in all the preceding experiments is unquestionably an excitation evoked by the current
of the primary response.
