Suppose p(x) =0 for all x € {a1,...,dg,b1,..., bg}. Then
p(a1),-- +, P(g), p(b1),.--, p(bg) € T. But then p(c) = Th, [e(aj), e(b;)] = 1 At, so in fact there are no
such p in V(t). Hence the section (sy,,.. “1Sags Sbyr ees Sb.) of L®8 is nowhere zero, so C2g(L®8) =
(ca(L)°8 =0. 7

When n> 1, the combinatorics of the vanishing loci of the relevant sections becomes more
complicated. The key idea in the proof of theorem 1.2 is similar to that in our earlier paper [14],
but the combinatorics required in this case is more intricate.
