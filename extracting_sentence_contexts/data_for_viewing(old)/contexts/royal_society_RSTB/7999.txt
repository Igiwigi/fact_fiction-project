The musculature of the elephant has not been thoroughly described except in the case
of the foetus of Loxodonta (Eales 1928), and that of the adult was not studied in the present
investigation. The blood vascular system and respiratory organs have been described in
some detail by previous workers, and such observations as were found possible in the field
dissections were in accord with the findings of previous workers. It was thought that the

description by Todd (1913) and others of a condition in which the lungs adhere per-
manently to the walls of the chest might not apply to the wild animal. The point was
investigated in a number of specimens, and it was found that the adhesion is in fact normal.
Pleural cavities are present in foetal stages and are obliterated soon after birth; costal
movements in breathing are thus reduced to a minimum and respiration is largely
diaphragmatic. This fact contributes to the remarkable stillness of a standing elephant in
repose. A very young elephant calf in distress was observed to call loudly and continuously,
its chest heaving very much after the manner of the young of the domestic cow or sheep.

The anatomy of the alimentary system has been fairly thoroughly described in both
Indian and African elephants, and nothing has been added during this research. Speci-
mens of selected parts of the gut wall were preserved and await study.

The male reproductive organs of the (African) foetus were described by Eales (1929),
and those of the (Indian) adult have since been described by Schulte (1937). A male
