The replacement of yellow by white is, of
course, quite normal. At 2-5 cone units, colours have become largely monochromatic,
except for blue, which continues to retain its colour in a very unusual manner. The fact
that this observer is normal-sighted at large visual angles suggests that his photoreceptors
are normal, and that therefore he is not at all colour-defective in the ordinary sense. Like
normal-sighted persons, his colour vision deteriorates with decrease in visual angle, but in
an unusual way. The changes observed could be accounted for by supposing the subject
to possess abnormal red and blue response mechanisms: a ‘red’ mechanism which changes
at too large a visual angle, and a ‘blue’ mechanism which changes at an angle which
is too small.
