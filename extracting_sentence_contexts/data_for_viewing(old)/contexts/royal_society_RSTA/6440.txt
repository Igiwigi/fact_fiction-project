motion of incompressible viscous simple fluids; in other words, the question is whether a smooth
flow and a smooth scalar pressure can exhibit spontaneous formation of singularities [12-14].
Besides its obvious analytical interest for the theory of regularity (which has been developed in
an appropriate sense also for classes of stochastic partial differential equations), such a question
is expected to be crucial in the understanding of turbulence [15]. In turn, a related basic question
emerges: whether the assumptions that give rise to the Navier-Stokes equations constitute an
appropriate setting for turbulence; in other words, we may ask whether the scheme of simple
(incompressible and viscous) fluids is appropriate to describe the transition from laminar to
turbulent flows. Physics shows us such a transition; so, under question is not its existence, rather
the way we describe it.

This type of questions motivates foundational analyses of models and/or theories (per se
classes of interconnected models). A question remains in fact vigilant every time we construct
a model: What are we actually doing?

Clarifying what is at the ground of a model or, better, a theory has even practical effects,
besides its indisputable theoretical interest: it addresses, in fact, analytical and computational
choices; it allows one to better understand the nature of approximations, avoiding as much as
possible their ad hoc introduction only for the sake of convenience; it clarifies the nature of
boundary conditions, distinguishing those physically admissible from those that are not so. In
short, besides their clarifying nature, such a type of analysis may have not only have an inspiring
role for mechanics and pure mathematics but also an inspiriting role.

Starting from the middle of the twentieth century, C. A. Truesdell III promoted, with his school,
a foundational program in continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, which started with the
