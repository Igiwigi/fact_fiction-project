The first attempt to do this
was through the notion of atomic flow [64,65], but unfortunately, no polynomial-time checking
algorithm has been found so far, and it is very likely that it cannot exist [66]. An alternative approach is to completely separate in a proof the purely linear part and
the duplication/erasure part, as it is done in Hughes’ combinatorial proofs [67]. In fact, for the
very restrictive case of classical proposition logic, combinatorial proofs meet all four objectives
discussed in §2. For this reason, I will give here more technical details. The example in figure 4 shows the combinatorial proof corresponding to the syntactic proofs
in figures 1 and 2.
