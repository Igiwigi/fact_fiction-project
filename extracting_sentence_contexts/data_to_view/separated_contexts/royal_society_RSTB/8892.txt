Activin A + Ly (without BMP4) and Nodal-treated conditions. To test the differentiation potential of cells with DE and
Endoderm-like cells were, therefore, induced by Activin A in foregut endoderm characteristics, we developed a protocol
EpiSCs of all three categories but only in Mixl1-early cells in which EpiSCs were subjected to extended differentiation
and, at a much lower abundance, in Mix!1-late cells following culture for a further 2 days in media supplemented with var-
Nodal induction. To assess the efficiency of Activin A and ious combinations of FGF10, BMP4, retinoic acid (RA) and
Nodal induction of DE versus visceral endoderm-like cells, an inhibitor of Hedgehog signalling (cyclopamine, cyc),
