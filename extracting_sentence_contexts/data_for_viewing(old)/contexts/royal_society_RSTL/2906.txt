method of making a new micrometer, upon a conſtrution |

entirely different from any that are now in uſe, which I have
been ſucceſsful enough to put in prattice, and by which I have
already begun to determine the diſtance of the centers of ſome
of the moſt remarkable double ſtars to a very great degree of
accuracy *,

The powers that may be uſed upon various double ſtars are
different, according to their relative magnitudes : e Bootis, for
inſtance, will not bear the ſame power as « Geminorum, nor
would it be difficult to aflign a reaſon for it ; but as I here ſhall
merely confine myſelf to facts, it will be ſufficient in general
to mention, that two ſtars, which are equal, or nearly fo,
will bear a very high power: with @ Geminorum I have gone
as far as 3168 ; but with the former only to 2010. The diffi-
culty of uſing high powers is exceedingly great ; for the field
of view takes in lefs than the diameter of the hair or wire in
the finder, and the effect of the earth's diurnal motion is-{0
great, that” it requires a great deal "of pradtice to find the
objec, and manage the inſtrument. It appears to me very
probable, that the diurnal -motion of the earth will be the
greateſt obſtacle to our progreſs in magnifying, "except we'can
introduce a proper mechaniſm to carry our teleſcopes in a con-
trary motion.
