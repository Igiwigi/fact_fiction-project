IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND REGENERATION OF BONE. 265

GrowtH oF Bone in Mouscte. In the foregoing (and in some of the subsequent) observations attention has been
called to the fact that muscles lying alongside of bone, which had been bereft of
its periosteum, were apt to have the connective tissue surrounding their contiguous
muscular fibres infiltrated with osteoblasts, and hence they became adherent to the
fresh osseous layers forming on the outside of the shaft. This was more marked where the nude bone was introduced in the shape of small
shavings and the muscles were made to intimately surround them, and more
especially where the connective tissue covering of the muscle fibres was lacerated. At such places the invasion of the osteoblasts was greater.
