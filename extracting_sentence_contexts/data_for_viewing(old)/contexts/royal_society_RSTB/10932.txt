starting point, however, is to assume that the traits are
entirely independently distributed. If we assume these con-
ditions, then on average (450/500) x (480/500) x 500 = 432
mimics will have neither trait, while only (50/500) x (470/
500) =47 models will have neither trait. Therefore, any
predator that avoided prey with either C+ or P+ would
have a net pay-off of 432-47 = 385 after exploiting all the
prey, which is lower than the pay-off were it to reject prey
based on C+ alone!

Why is it that a predator that attended to one trait (C+)
rather than two traits (either C+ or P+) would have a higher
pay-off despite the fact that both traits are disproportionately
more frequent in models than their mimics? We can answer
this question by calculating the marginal pay-offs. Consider
a predator that began by avoiding C+ prey on encounter, so
that prey with both C+ and P+, and prey with C+ alone are
avoided. We need to ask whether it would have paid the pred-
ator to also have avoided prey with P+ alone (no C+). We can
calculate the expected number of mimics with P+ alone as
20 — (20/500) x (50/500) x 500 = 18 while the number of
models with P+ alone would be 30 — (30/500) x (450/
500) x 500 = 3. So, if the predator avoids any prey with C+,
then the remaining prey with the pattern P+ that lacked
colour C+ are more likely to be mimics than models, and
