It seems that sync would
be perfectly suited for tackling the silent singularity conjecture. If we consider the past timelike
trajectory of a spatial point, it is a standard expectation (cf. e.g.[20], fig. 1) that the null cone of
the vertex point will become more and more narrow and inhomogeneities will be pushed outside
of them, hence residing outside regions of causal communications. However, we have seen in
the present paper that causally unconnected spatial points may in fact sync with each other, and
this could possibly contribute in making the evolution along neighbouring timelines decouple. Nevertheless, such decoupled spatial points will evolve in unison due to sync even if they were
in causal communication only transiently or at all. Data accessibility.
