Now Mr. Boyle having counterpoiſed a piece of ice

in a ſcale, hung itout in a froſty night, and found next |
morning that it had loſt conſiderably of its weight by /
evaporation. © Who (ſays he) would have thought
that ſo extremely hard and cold a body would eyapo-

rate ſo faſt in the clear air of a freezing night?” And |
fince that time others have obſerved the fame thing |
which fact ſeems to be an unanſwerable objefion to all
the accounts in which rarefaCtion by heat is made to be
the chief, if not the only cauſe of evaporation ; and,
therefore, we muſt have recourſe to ſome other
principle to afliſt us in agcounting for this phzno-
menon. As the author of nature does not employ in his
works a greater variety of cauſes than is abſolutely
neceflary; it is the bufineſs of natural philoſophy to
reduce as many phznomena as may be to ſome ge-
neral well known cauſe; and this1s to be done by
comparing the phznomena together in their ſeveral
circumſtances, in which, if they are found to agree,
they are then to be conſidered as effets of the ſame
kind, and aſcribed to the ſame cauſe, By which means
the cauſes, whoſe exiſtence is already proved, will
be rendered more general, and our knowledge more
extenſive. Now as the ſuſpenſion of the particles
of water in air, of falt in the waters of the ocean,
and of other heavy bodies in the fluids that diflolve
them, ſeem to be phaznomena of the fame kind,
we might reaſonably ſuppoſe that they ariſe from

the ſame cauſe; and that , what we call evapora-
tion is no.
