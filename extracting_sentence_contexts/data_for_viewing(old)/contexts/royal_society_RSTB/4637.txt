(2) One piece of three original segments.

(3) One piece of three original segments.

(4) One piece of eight original segments.

(5) One piece of four original segments.

(6) Original posterior end with about twenty segments, pygidium and anal cirri.

All the evidence tends to show that what happened in this last case is typical of
what takes place most frequently when reproduction by fragmentation and regenera-
tion occurs in nature, excepting for the fact that the fourth piece of eight segments
would naturally break into two pieces of four segments each.

In the first place, the break after the sixteenth segment is of very frequent
occurrence. Amongst worms which had just been brought in from outside, or had
been living for « short time, up to three weeks or a month, in finger-bowls in the
laboratory, there are definite detailed records of sixty-five cases in which an original
anterior portion had regenerated posterior segments.

The numbers of original anterior setigerous segments found in these sixty-five
specimens are given in the following Table, with the number of specimens recorded
corresponding to each :—
