noble collection. As the exterior appearance of these crystals
was different from that which is peculiar to carbonate of lime,
I was desirous to ascertain their nature, and therefore endea-
voured to bring them, by splitting, into the primitive rhom-
boidal form of this substance ; but, upon making the attempt, I
perceived, to my great astonishment, not only that I was not
able to obtain any fracture that could possibly belong to the
planes of the primitive rhomboid, but also, that the substance
strongly resisted every attempt I made to procure a fracture in
any other direction. In fact, every fracture I could obtain was
irregular, and possessed more or less of that vitreous appearance
which is peculiar to. the greater number of hard stones. So
remarkable was the hardness of this $ubstance, that, although

the points of the crystals were very thin, and consequently might

scrupulous attention, every thing relating to the peculiar cha-
racters of this substance.
