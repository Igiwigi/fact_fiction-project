Given that nasal respiration appears to be actively
involved in human memory, the question is why? It is not a
question of oxygen; oral respiration, which supplies a greater
volume of air, has a significantly smaller effect [37,38], and
here our focus on murines might be a good thing. If the olfac-
tory system and the hippocampus are in fact a limbic
navigational system [39], then using two highly olfactory
model species is a lucky break. However to proceed further,
to ask the right questions of these and other species, to ident-
ify the mechanisms, we need to understand the behaviour at
multiple levels of analysis, including adaptive function and
phylogeny [40,41]. Geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, a friend of my grand-
father, Gregory Altschuller, wrote in 1973: ‘Nothing in biology

makes sense except in light of evolution’ [42, p. 125].
