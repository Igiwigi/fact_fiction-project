It is true that in the very simple case I
have just stated, these inconveniences, though really existing,
are not felt. If we take one a little more complicated, they
will speedily form a prominent part of the diſficulty. Suppose
thelaw of formation of the terms of a series were, for instance,
as follows:

Y. = + 2, u,=bu, + Buy u,=Cu, þ ally,

u, = au, + Pu,, ug = bu, + al, u, =Cug o+ Bu, , &c.
it would be necessary to divide the whole investigation into
SIX cases, and to integrate six several equations of differences,

Ups + 2 ls gp 1+ lex Uer4 3= Olex +2 +PU6z+ 1» KC.
and after all, the general term of the series would not be
obtained, but merely the several general terms of six other
s8eries which, interlaced, as it were, one with the other, form
the series in question; which is in fact much the same way


Mr. HensCHEL on circulating functions, &c. 147

of proceeding as it would be to consider the series of natural
numbers as consisting of several other arithmetical progres-

sions such as
SO YORTS} ET TEN 21300 Ge!
GEES IS BEIT 5 12-06
EEE IO. 14" 15," &c.
the general terms of which are respectively gy — 2, gov— 1;
3z, united into one, the general term of which is w. It is interesting then to discover some analytical artifice
which shall obviate these inconveniences, by comprehending
the whole extent of these and similar series in one single
equation, whose order shall be no higher than is absolutely
indispensible ; which shall require no preparatory investiga-
tion to obtain it; nor the actual calculation of any superfluous
terms for the determination of the constants in its integral ;
and, finally, whose integration $hall lead to an expression in
functions of the index wx, such that the substitution of the
natural progression of numbers in succession for z shall pro-
duce all the terms of the series in their order. Such an
artifice, or train of artifices, I shall now proceed to explain.
