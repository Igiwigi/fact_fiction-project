To recapitulate the substance of my observations. I have
ftirst adduced some arguments in support of migration, the
fact itself not being generally admitted by naturalists of ce-
lebrity, and also against the hypothesis of a state of torpor,
or what may be termed the hybernating system. I have
represented that the s8wallow tribe, and many other birds
that absent themselves at stated periods, return annually


on the migration of birds. 43

to the same spot to build their nests; and at the same
time that any inference drawn from this fact in support
of a state of torpor, would be fallacious upon physiologi-
cal principles. That certain periodical changes of the testes
and ovaria, are the inciting causes of migration. 'I have
stated many facts, hitherto, I believe, unnoticed, - chiefly
with respect to the cazse which excites the migrating bird,
at certain seasons of the year, to quit one country for an-
other, ( viz.) the enlargement of the testes in the male, and
ovaria in the female, and the need of a country where they
can for a while be better accommodated with succours for
their infant brood, than in that from which they depart.
It is also attempted to be shown, that their departure
from this country is not in consequence of any disagree-
