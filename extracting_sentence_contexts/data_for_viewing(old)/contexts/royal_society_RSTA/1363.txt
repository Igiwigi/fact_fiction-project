Then p-e=s, p-é=t, and p€ S? provided
y72(1 — 42)? = (8? +P — 2ast +27 — 1) > 0.
Hence given t € [—1,1] we have that f(s) = ¢(t) for all s satisfying
+P —2arst+a2-1<0,
so that f(s) is constant in the interval
at—/a-1)0-2),at+ Ja—-2)0-P).

This interval depends continuously on ft and at t = 4 the right-hand endpoint is 1, while at f= —A
the left-hand endpoint is —1. Therefore, f is constant on [—1, 1], giving the result. a

Remark 3.7. A more sophisticated proof is to use the fact that any rotation is a product of a
finite number of rotations about e and é, as proved in [12] (see also [13]). Thus p(Rp) = p(p) for
all R € SO(3), so that p is constant.

Corollary 3.8. If p ePNC(S?) is axisymmetric and has cubic symmetry then p(p)=1/4 is
constant.

Proof. If p is axisymmetric with axis e and has cubic symmetry then we have that
e(Qip)=f(Qip-e)=/(P Qe) forall Qe P™.

But if Qe were parallel to e for all i this would imply that Q? € P4 := P48 m SO(3) has the same
axis of rotation e for each i, which is not the case. Hence, p is axisymmetric with respect to two
non-parallel axes of rotation. | |
