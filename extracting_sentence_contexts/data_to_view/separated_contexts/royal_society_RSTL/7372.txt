the catheter is being paszed through the prostatic portion of the urethra, and which is
not felt by the female, is owing probably not 80 much to the supposed heightened
sensibility of the parts as to mechanical obstruction and entanglement. That the park
in question is referable to the region of the verumontanum and wr to the trigone, as is
commonly believed, scems certain from a fact first stated by GuTHRE®, that in the
healthy bladder even when moderately distended the triangular Space degcends 80 boy to be
beyond the reach of the catheter. The extreme sensitiveness of the trigone in disease,
or when irritated by the presence of a stone, is moreover no proof of its increased
sensibility in the normal condition of the parts. If the trigone, as SABATIER, BELL, and
others affirm, be 80 delicately sensitive, it is difficult to understand hoy the urine, which
naturally collects in the neck of the bladder, is not expelled almost as s00n as it is
received.
