they might be invoked to decide the nature of the action revealed by Mr. Ber. The
result was mentally clear before the experiment was made. I pictured a highly
absorbent vapour exposed to the shocks of the intermittent beam, suddenly expanding
during the moment of exposure, and as 8uddenly contracting when the beam was
intercepted. Pulses of an amplitude probably far greater than those obtainable with
solids would, I thought, be thus produced ; and these pulses, if caused to succeed each
other with sufficient rapidity, would be sure to produce musical gounds.

This idea was tested and verified on the spot. The Journal of Telegraph Engineers
for December 8th, 1880, contains the following record of what occurred. © When
Professor BELL was good enough to show me his experiments, I happened to be
myself experimenting on the action of vapours upon radiant heat. Old experiments
had revealed, and new ones had confirmed the fact that, as regards the absorption of
heat, there existed vast differences between vapours. This is well illustrated by the
deportment of bisulphide of carbon and of sulpharic ether, one of which is highly
transparent, and the other highly opaque to radiant heat. Tt occurred to me that, if
the action were due to the absorption of heat, we might possibly extract musical
sounds ſrom sulphuric ether vapour, whereas bisulphide of carbon vapour being trans-
parent to heat-rays they would for the most part go through this vapour unabsorbed,
and produce no 80norous effect. I think Professor BELL will bear me witness as to
the result. We placed a quantity of sulphuric ether vapour in a test tube, and
allowed an intermittent beam of light to strike upon the vapour far above the liquid,
.and we heard distinctly a musical tone of a pitch corresponding to the rapidity of the
flaches. We then took the bisulphide of carbon vapour, and tried it in a similar
manner, but neither Professor BELL nor myself could hear any trace of a musical
