whole suspended system to a high degree of astaticism. The small trimming magnets were
attached to the heads of small screws inserted in tapped holes. The magnets could then be
rotated to any desired angle.

The magnetic moment of each Vectolite magnet was 60c.g.s.; the stronger pair of trim-
ming magnets with which coarse adjustment was done had moments about 1-0c.g.s., and
the weaker pair used for fine adjustment about 0-2c.g.s.

This magnetometer was found very satisfactory and showed the great effectiveness of
this method of achieving a high astaticism. Under favourable conditions the mean error of
a reading was not very much larger than the calculated thermal value.

It was thought possible that the fact that the mean error was normally considerably
greater than the thermal error might be due to fluctuations of the vertical gradient of the
earth’s horizontal field. To eliminate this effect a parastatic system was built, with four
magnets consisting of pieces of Caslox 2-5 x 0-55cm magnetized transversely. As this
material is machinable, holes were drilled along their long axis, and they were threaded
like beads on to lengths of phosphor-bronze wire which were attached to a short Perspex
