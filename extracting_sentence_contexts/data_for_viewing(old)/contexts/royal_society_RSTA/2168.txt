(Observation 2 but not Observation 1), the computation in the VAC would lead to a low DCsum
value which might dip below threshold. This will cause the output duty cycle DCout to become
incorrect. During Observation 1, although V4q dips low, the computation because of the weights,
etc., produces a high relative value result that manages to keep DCsum above threshold. This is
not the case during Observation 2. On the other hand, if Vyq itself reduces below threshold, no
matter what value the VAC produces the voltage to PWM part will produce relatively large errors
as the perceptronâ€™s glue logic would kick in anyway.

Also of concern is the accumulation of nonlinearity after both parts of the perceptron have
been put together, and this nonlinearity continues to increase once the perceptron is connected in
series across multiple stages of an NN of non-trivial depth.

Another issue is the fact that there may be difficulties for the perceptron to implement AFs
other than flavours of ReLU. Of particular concern is that the perceptron, because of the use of


the voltage across a grounded capacitor to represent a crucial value, only works in the positive
value domain.

Future research topics include the better matching between the constituent parts of the
perceptron to overcome the threshold and nonlinearity problems and the extension of the
perceptron to cover a larger set of AFs.
