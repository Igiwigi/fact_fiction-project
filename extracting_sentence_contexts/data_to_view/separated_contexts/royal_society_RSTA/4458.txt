The transition is smooth as the slow codon is at the initiation site, so there can be no
sharp onset of queuing. In summary, for type 1 mRNAs there is a first order phase transition as [aaa] is reduced: we
move from a regime where protein production is limited by the initiation rate ky to a regime
where it is limited by the slow codon. For type II mRNAs, the protein production rate is limited
by both initiation and the slow codon; i.e. due to the fact that the first codon is slow, initiation of
new ribosomes is hindered.

(b) Amino acid starvation can lead to increased tRNA charging

Figure 2 demonstrates that amino acid starvation impairs the ribosome traffic. In this subsection,
we describe how this decreased traffic can affect the charging levels of a tRNA species delivering
an amino acid that is not subject to starvation. In figure 3a, we introduce two further idealized
mRNAs which contain three codon species and we denote these mRNA X and mRNA Y.
