whether high or low, is associated with an array of different
challenges, some that stimulate long-term elevations in GC
production and others that stimulate short-term elevations.
These different challenges may confer different influences
on physiology and health.

(c) Metabolic and health effects of short- versus long-

term glucocorticoid elevations
Studies with laboratory rodents suggest that short- versus
long-term GC elevations have different influences on health-
related processes. We review some of these findings and
apply these lessons to primates based on the fact that HPA
regulatory processes are evolutionarily conserved, with signifi-
cant homology among vertebrate species [108-110]. Effects of


HPA axis hormones on health processes in laboratory rodents
may generalize to a wide range of vertebrate organisms.

GCs are widely recognized for their effects on carbohydrate
metabolism, gluconeogenesis and subsequent increased blood
glucose. In addition, GCs regulate lipid metabolism in adipose
tissue, enhance de novo lipid synthesis in the liver, and increase
protein catabolism [111,112]. The release of energy-rich substra-
