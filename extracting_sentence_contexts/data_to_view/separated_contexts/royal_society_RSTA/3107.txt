A second experiment, in which a 50 per cent. solution of silver nitrate was saturated
with nitrite by the addition of KNO, and then diluted and filtered, gave the value
111837 (52d) for the electrochemical equivalent. In this case the saturation of the
solution was evidenced by the fact that needles of silver nitrite actually crystallised
out from the solution on standing in a cool place. The above experiments show clearly that silver nitrite even when present in
considerable quantity does not raise the electrochemical equivalent by more than
one part in 10,000 and can only be an unimportant impurity. In view of the yellow
tint of the nitrite crystals, which should be colourless when pure, we are by no means
certain that the slight increase which we have observed may not be due to hyponitrite
(vide infra) and not to the nitrite itself.
