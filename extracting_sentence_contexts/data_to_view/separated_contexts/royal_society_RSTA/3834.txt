These particulars are taken from notes
supplied by the Rev. Mr. Durrus, the Anglican rector. He states that the “sea
rose in Bequia Harbour about 2 feet 6 inches.” It is a curious fact that while sea
waves were noticed here and in St. Lucia and Barbados, no one seems to haye
observed them in St. Vincent. If they took place there, they must certainly
have been quite inconsiderable, as many people were launching boats or landing
from them along the leeward coast from Chateaubelair southwards, and any sudden
change in the level of the sea could hardly have escaped remark, There are many
houses in these districts which stand very little above sea-level, and the incursion
of a sea wave would have left traces too obvious to be overlooked. St. Lucia.—A most interesting account of the phenomena observed by him in
St. Lucia, has been sent to us by Major Hopper, R.E., who was in Castries during
the eruptions.
