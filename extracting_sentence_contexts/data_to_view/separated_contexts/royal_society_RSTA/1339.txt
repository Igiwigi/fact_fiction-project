The existence of II, ,,; (i.e, the regularity of Il,,,,..) would trivially
imply the existence of I,,,,. The (s — u)-dimensional elements I,_,,, of Tu, may be seen to be the uth
vertex figures of those s-dimensional elements of II,, which occur at one II,_,. Expressing
this fact numerically (the properties of II,,, being distinguished from those of I,
by changing “ p” into “ p, w’’), we have

pu

2.61 Cl aa: w) = (P| Pa (u Pa ee m). This is a special case of the still more obvious relation
2.62 rulm—uu) = (lm) (« —L rss sm),

in which we may. as usual, replace m by n (= m).
