The experiments with the platina gilt crucible afford the
most unequiyocal proofs of metallic arsenic ; whilst those with the platina foil
and spoon, though seemingly more ambiguous, will, on examination, I presume,
be found scarcely less satisfactory. Thus the partial oxidation of the surface
exhibited in yariegated colours; the strong cobesion of the arsenic to the pla-
tina, are .characteristics of the metal. The alliaceous odour (in cases where
no deoxygenating substance can be presumed to exist) is admitted to belong
only to the metal ; insolubility in strong muriatic- acid, is a property of no

known oxide of arsenic, but of the metal. 'To which may be added the facts,
that I have repeatedly coated the arsenic, deposited on platina, with copper,
and also with mercury ; and removed both, without affecting the arsenic. All
these circumstances seem to prove the accuracy of the statements made on the
subject. Though zinc and platina were the metals used in the electro-chemical ex-
periments on arsenic already noticed, I have also employed several other
metals which generally afforded analogous results.
