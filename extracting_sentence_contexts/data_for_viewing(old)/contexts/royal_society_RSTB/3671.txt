by fairly large spaces from the interseminal scales. Such sections are shown in
the more central part of fig. 9, the edges of which show the megasporophylls cut
nearer their apical ends, also in fig. 26 and in text-fig. 3, A. It is by no means
improbable that the large spaces between the loose sheath and the interseminal
scales (figs. 20, 22, 23, 26, etc.) are the result of the disappearance of loose tissues
such as Liagnrer, Sonms—Lauspacn, and WreLanp have described in the seed-
peduncles of Bennettitean strobili; but further reference is made to this possibility on
a later page.

A reference to text-fig. 3, E, d, illustrates a common feature in the mega-
sporophylls, namely, the intimate association, and in some cases apparently organic
connection, between the loose cylinder of cells and the tissue of adjacent interseminal
scales. This fact, in conjunction with other features already alluded to, points to
an absence of a well-defined limiting layer in the pedicels of the ovules and reminds
one of the absence of a normal epidermis in the seed-peduncles of Bennettites.*

Bracts and Hairs.—The bracts of the Eathie species agree generally with those of
Bennettites Gibsonianus Carr, and B. Morierei (Sap. and Mar.), as also with the
corresponding structures in American examples of Cycadeoidea. The great
abundance of secretory sacs, the occurrence of thick-walled hypoderm, and, so far as
can be ascertained, the structure of the vascular bundles are features common to all.
The ground-tissue cells in B. Gibsonianus have all thick walls with scalariform
thickening,t while in Williamsonia scotica this tissue consists only in part of
