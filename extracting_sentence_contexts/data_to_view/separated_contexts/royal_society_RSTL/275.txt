When the
pencil of light falls in the direction TV, its lustre suffers a
great diminution : the: light gradually assumes a red colour,
and vanishes altogether when the obliquity is considerable. But if the pencil is incident at the same angle on the opposite
side, as PQ, its lustre suffers very litle diminution, and its
colour is not sensibly altered. These facts admit, to a certain extent, of an easy explana-
tion if we suppose that the plate of agate consists of lamine
m1, op imperfectly transparent, alternating with laminee ca, ef,
which are more pervious to light, a structure which is indicated
by the.existence of a bright and a nebulous image. In this
case the intensity of the light will obviously be a maximum


transmitted through crystallized Bodies. 195

when the ray RS is parallel to mz, and a ray PQ will, within
certain limits, suffer less' diminution of lustre than a ray TV
falling with the same angle of incidence on the other side
of RS. When RS and mn are perpendicular to the surfaces of AB,
and when PQ and TV form equal angles with the perpendi-
cular RS, their intensity should be equal; but this is by, no
means the case, for the transmitted light which is incident on
the side T of RS appears to have a different character from
that which is. incident on the other side.
