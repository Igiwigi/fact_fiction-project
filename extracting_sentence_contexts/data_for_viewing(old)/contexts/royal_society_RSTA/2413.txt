equation describing the production of blood cells [2]. The control of the cellular production at
time t is based on the current number of blood cells x(t). However, there exists a significant delay
t between the initiation of cellular production and the release of mature cells into the blood.
This means that the change x(t) of the number of blood cells at time t depends not only on the
instantaneous number of blood cells x(t) but also on the retarded configuration x(t — rT). In general,
a nonlinear delay system can be described by the delay differential equation (DDE)

x'() =f(x(t), x(t — 1), (1.1)

where f denotes a nonlinear function. For example, in the Mackey—Glass equation, we have
f(x, Xr) = Bx, /(1 + x) — yx with the fixed parameters f, 1 and y. To capture the effects of the
time delay one needs a description which takes the history of the system into account, and
thus requires a dynamical system with an infinite-dimensional phase space. In fact, it turns
out that the state of the DDE (1.1) at time f¢ is given by the function x(@), 6 €[t—1,t] (see
[3,4] for the mathematical theory on DDEs). Therefore, DDEs such as equation (1.1) are able to
produce extremely complex behaviour and bifurcation scenarios. For example, albeit its relatively
simple scalar description, the Mackey—Glass equation shows periodic, aperiodic as well as chaotic
behaviour. Moreover, it has been shown that the dimension of the chaotic attractors of delay
systems grows linearly with the delay [5]. This means that extremely high-dimensional chaos is
possible for DDEs with large delay, which makes them interesting for applications. In general,
time delay is able to induce instabilities, multistability and chaotic motion on the one hand, but
on the other hand can also suppress instabilities, stabilize unstable stationary or periodic states,
and render an initially complex and chaotic system predictable.

The classical studies of time delay dynamics were driven by engineering and mathematics
