agitation, but without more than a merely momentary preponderance of either, When
large and rapid fluctuations present themselves, we sometimes find considerable and
apparently irregular differences in the successive tabulated directions of the magnet
(taken, as must be remembered, at the precise instants of the equidistant epochs); but
the more regular and systematic prevalence of easterly deflection at particular hours, and
of westerly deflection at other hours, usually overrides, even in the individual cases as it
does altogether in the means, the partial influence of the fluctuations.

The excess of easterly over westerly, or of westerly over easterly deflection at the
8everal hours in the ninety-five days is a measure of the influence which the disturbances
would necessarily exercise on the © diurnal inequality” derived from the hourly means
of the ninety-five days, if the elimination of the disturbances were unattended to: the
excess thus referred to constitutes, in fact, the disturbance-diurnal variation due to that
portion of the disturbances occurring in the five years which is included in the ninety-
five days contained in the Table. This part of the subject will be resumed in the third
8ection of this paper.
