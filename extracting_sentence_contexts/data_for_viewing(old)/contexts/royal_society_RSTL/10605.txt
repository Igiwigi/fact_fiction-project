We have already alluded to the fact that, in the case of various plants growing in
aszociation, the number of individual plants within a given area is generally small in

rtion as the number of 8pecies is also small. The diminution not only in the
number of *species, but in that of individual plants, is usually the result of conditions
favouring the luxuriance of some 8pecies more than others ; and hence the competition
between plant and plant becomes more s8evere. The variety and the number are
Â© reduced, but the strength and size of those which remain are enhanced. The experi-
mental details given in the sequel will afford some striking illustrations of these facts.
Naegerr* considers the internecine war to be the most severe between those species
and varieties which are the most nearly allied in character and organisation, because
they require the same conditions of existence. He cites in illustration the case of
Qhree species of Achillea, two of which, A. moschata and 4. atrata, make similar
Rllemands on their environment, and 80 come into competition one with another, with
She result that the two are rarely found together, because one overpowers the other.
he third species, A. Millefolium, having a different organisation from the other two is
mot brought into competition with them because its requirements are different ; and ib
As, in consequence, found growing with either or both of the others. It mus be
Zemembered, however, that plants very elosely allied morphologically, so far as their
utward conformation is concerned, may, nevertheless, vary greatly in physiological
Zndowments. We see this in the very varied constitutional and physiological peculi-
