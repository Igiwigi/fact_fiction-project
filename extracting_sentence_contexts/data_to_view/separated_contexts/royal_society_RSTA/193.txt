q The main differences between the elementary theory and the exact general theory of
8 Pochhammer and Chree are as follows: (1) According to the simple theory, the velocity of
a sinusoidal wave is independent of A and is equal to cy, (= ,/(E/p)) ; according to the general
a.theory, ¢ is determined by a, A, cy and o, where @ is Poisson’s ratio, and, in fact, (¢/cg) is a
ic function of ¢ and (a/A), which is unity only in the limit when a/A is zero. Dispersion will
© therefore occur in the general case, and if an arbitrary disturbance, originating at x = 0,
& say, is resolved into its Fourier components, the relative phases of these components vary
with the distance from the origin and the disturbance suffers distortion as it travels along the
gq By Dar (2) According to the simple theory, the longitudinal stress and displacement are
= uniform over the cross-section of the bar, the radial stress is everywhere zero and the radial

@ displacement at distance r from the axis is gr/E. In the general case, the longitudinal stress
s and displacement vary over the cross-section of the bar, the radial stress is finite and the

radial displacement does not follow the simple linear law.
