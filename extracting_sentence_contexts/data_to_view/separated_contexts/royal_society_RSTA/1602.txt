In the above formula, we can simply consider the composition QN instead of JQN since Im(Q)
and ker(L) can be identified (even if it is not technically correct to say that they coincide, being
subspaces of different spaces) and we can choose J as the identity. It is possible to check that u € D
is a T-periodic solution of (1.5), if and only if it is a fixed point of &. Hence, the problem of finding
T-periodic solutions to equation (1.5) is brought back to the search of fixed points of the operator
®, or, equivalently, to the search of solutions to the nonlinear functional equation

u— P(u)=0. (2.9)

Property (A) yields the well known fact that, although Kp is not compact, the Nemitski
operator is L-compact and the coincidence degree theory is therefore applicable in order to study
equation (2.9). This will be done in the following two sections.


3. The general result

In this section, we prove the existence of T-periodic positive solutions of problem (1.5).
