162. Hence it would appear that there is no other essential difference between Oper-
culing and Nunmulites*, than that which consists in the closing in of the spire,
affirmed by MM. D"ARCHIAC and Haim to be a constant character of the latter, whilst
in the former the spire seems ordinarily to open out 80 long as it continues to increase.
But even this is not an invariable difference ; for I have met with several specimens of
Opereulina, in which the spire closes in by a somewhat abrupt inflexion of the marginal
cord, 80 as to produce a rapid diminution in the size of the last four or five chambers,
ending (as it would appear) in a complete cessation of growth. FExamples of this kind
are represented in fig. 8, Plate III. and fig. 3, Plate V.; and in Fig. IX. is shown the
closing septum of one of these specimens upon a more enlarged Fig. IX.
scale. Looking, however, to the circumstance that these specimens
bear but a very small proportion to those which exhibit no snch
tendency, and also to the fact that some of the specimens in
which this closing-in is seen are very far from having attained
their full growth, I am disposed to regard it as an abnormal, or
at least as only an occasional occurrence in Operculing; and I
must confess that, notwithstanding the positive assertion of
MM. Â»*Arcniac and Hans, I still entertain doubts as to whether
it is to be accounted as a uniform characteristic of Nummulites.
At any rate, the occasional occurrence of this condition in Oper-
culina deprives the character of that constancy which is requisite
to make it good for generic differentiation ; and if Operculing and
Nummulites are to be retained as separate genera, I cannot per-
ceive by what features they are to be distinguished, save by the
marked compression in form, the limited number of convolutions,
