ridges themselves are capable of independent growth, that they have to accommodate
themselves at the surface of a limited bulk of material, and that in some cases their increase
in length may considerably affect the shape of the scale.

The first example is taken from the hair-scales of the scent-brush of Danais septentrionalis
Btlr. Ifa single hair-scale is examined from base to tip, it is found to be of constant diameter
throughout the greater part of its length (the tip itself is often missing). Under oil
immersion it can be seen that whereas at the base of the scale the ridges are running
parallel to the long axis (figure 40, plate 2), they become ‘wavy’ as they pass along
distally (figures 41 and 42, plate 2). The amplitude of the waves increases distally, until
the ridges appear to break up into short segments, jumbled together more or less at random
(figure 43, plate 2). These changes suggest that the ridges have to be accommodated in
a surface of limited area, and that their meandering course is the expression of the fact that
they are continuing to grow in length in a surface already limited by the volume which it
bounds; that is to say, they continued to grow in length after the cylindrical bristle was laid
down.

A second example is provided by the androconium of Pieris brassicae, already considered
in another connexion. It is clear from figure 58, plate 3, that the course of the ridges is
intimately connected with the shape of the scale. Assuming that the rudiment of this scale
does not differ in organization from that of other scales, the formation of the posteriorly
directed horns at the base of the androconium, on either side of the stalk, can be regarded
as an exaggeration of the tendency—observable in other scales (for example, the wing-
