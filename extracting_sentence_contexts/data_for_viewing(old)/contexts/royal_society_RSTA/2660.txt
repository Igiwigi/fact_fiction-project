1. Introduction _

Italy is one of the most active volcanic regions of Europe. The peninsula sits on top of the : =
point where the Eurasian Plate meets the African Plate and suffers from considerable seismic : 3
and volcanic activity. There are four very active volcanoes in Italy (Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano and : =
Vesuvius). We plan to use muography to glean further insights into the workings of two of these 2
volcanoes, namely Vesuvius and Stromboli. The former is famous for the destruction of Pompeii [3
and Herculaneum in the eruption in 79 AD and is now in the middle of the sprawling urban : |
development that has characterized the city of Naples in the past 100 years. :8
It is, in fact, impossible to underestimate the disaster potential of this situation. Vesuvius has : S
erupted many times since and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted “S

within the last 100 years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world
because of the population of 3000 000 people living nearby (figure 1), making it the most densely
populated volcanic region in the world, and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of
the Plinian type.

The specific areas actually affected by the ash cloud depend upon the particular circumstances
surrounding the eruption and, probably, the volcanic plug conformation. The evacuation plan
(http: / /www.protezionecivile.gov.it/jems/it/view_pde.wp?contentId=PDE12771) put in place
by the Italian ‘Protezione Civile’ assumes between two weeks and 20 days notice of an eruption
and foresees the emergency evacuation of 600000 people, almost entirely comprising all those
