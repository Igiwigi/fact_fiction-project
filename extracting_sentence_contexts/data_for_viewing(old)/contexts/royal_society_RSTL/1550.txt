thus formed, or it is permitted to remain, and the cavity is
filled up by the same secretion; of the former process' we
have an instance in Bulimus decollata ; and of the latter many
instances occur, familiar to the knowledge of conchologists.
The Ocytho# offers to our consideration a remote deviation
from these ordinary laws which apply to the testaceous
mollusca, inasmuch as it only resides in the last vulution-or
body of the shell. In the specimen above described, the
sides of the abdomen are slightly canaliculated, in conformity
with the sculpture of the inner lateral surface of the shell;
but it is worthy of remark, that the portion which corresponds
with the most unequal part of the chamber, the carina, is not
at all indented ; which fact induces the supposition that the

Such also is the form of the inferior part of the abdomen,
that it never could have revolved in the cavity of the invo-
