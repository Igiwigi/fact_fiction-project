mature, they are flat and grooved filaments, having the compound structure above de-
scribed. With the shortening of the longitudinal filaments (<fibrillee”) in muscular
contraction, the surrounding spirals—and of course the striz—become elongated and

Situated one within the other, there cannot well be much difference in their lengths,
when the fasciculus is broken off. Hence in part, probably, it is that the fasciculus
