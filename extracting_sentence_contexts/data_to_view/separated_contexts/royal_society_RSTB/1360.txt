In the second case the insects were bred during
the present season (1895) and killed within a few hours of emergence from the pupa. If the precipitation by silver is carried out in the presence of excess of ammonium
hydrate a compound is obtained which contains ammonia and a larger percentage
silver (50Â°7 per cent.). It would seem to be a molecular compound of the formula
Ag,X, Ag NH,X, in which the substance acts as a dibasic acid; but it is refe:
