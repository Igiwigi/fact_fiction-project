For m=<3>4/?, the loop has altered its form in s8uch wise as to exhibit the node
and two cusps, the curve has therefore two real nodes. A TEAS - £ ; :

For m=v/2, the two nodes unite together into a tacnode, 80 that the loop is on the
point of disappearing; and for m<a/2>1 the nodes are imaginary, and there is thus
no longer any loop. [

16 PROFESSOR CAYLEY'S SUPPLEMENTARY MEMOIR ON CAUSTICS. For m=1, the double tangent has the two coincident real intersections y=0, or it is
in fact a triple tangent. For m<1>0, the double tangent has with the curve two real intersections, viz. they
are the points where the double tangent meets the circle a*+4*=1. And finally, for m=0, the points in question unite themselves with the points of
contact, the double tangent z=0 being in this case the common tangent at the two

cusps z=0, y==+1.
