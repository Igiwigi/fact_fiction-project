Regarding the first question, the Bloch sphere presentation was meant to illustrate that the
evolution of states induced by Hamiltonians can be given geometric interpretation. In particular,
we have argued that, for the initial state |0), evolution of probabilities Prob,(t) depends only
on the polar angle of the vector n defined by the Hamiltonian H=n-o. In view of the fact that
the main features of the probabilistic behaviour are insensitive to the particular distribution
of weights between o, and oy, one may simplify the picture by considering only o, and oy
components in the Hamiltonian. Regarding o, + oz and oy +z, the resulting Hamiltonian mixes
amplitudes across the state, that is, it combines amplitude in each slot of the mental state with
amplitude from other slots. However, ox + oy merely swaps amplitude from one slot to another.
