To waste them, is therefore to undo, what has been expressly prepared for our use
by a beautiful system of contrivances, and to place ourselves under the necessity‚Äù of
performing, by an expenditure of our own labour and capital, those very processes,
which nature had already accomplished for us, without cost, by the aid of those
animate or inanimate agents which she has at her disposal.

4thly. The analyses above reported may suggest caution as to the inferences which
some might be disposed to deduce from certain researches lately announced, with re-
spect to the power which a plant possesses of substituting one alkali, or one earth,
for another, in the processes of vegetation.

This substitution indeed, however brought about, is a fact which hardly admits of
being questioned, supported as it is by the testimony of men $80 eminent as SAUSSURE
and as LizB16, and indeed many of the analyses detailed in this paper might be ap-
pealed to in corroboration of its truth.

Thus we find, that whilst the amount of bases agreed pretty nearly in the three
crops of the same plant which had been analysed, the proportions between them
often varied considerably. This is particularly seen in the case of the lime and mag-
nesia, the deficiency in one of these earths being often made up by an excess in the
other.

In like manner a deficiency of potass is found to be compensated by an increased
amount of soda, and the same remark seems to apply to the acids.
