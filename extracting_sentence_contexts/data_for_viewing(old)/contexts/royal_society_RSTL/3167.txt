but that it equally obeys either et of agents, whether applied to the brain or
spinal marrow; while the muscles of voluntary motion obey no stimulus acting
through the nervous system, unless it be applied to their nerves themselves or to
the particular parts of that system from which their nerves arise. I found from
repeated experiments that the yessels bear the same relation to the neryous
system as the heart does, their power being independent of this system, but
equally with the heart capable of being influenced by either stimulants or
sedatives applied either to the brain or spinal marrow, and that eyen to the
instantaneous destruction of their power. They in all respects bear the same
relation to the nervous system with the heart, which affords the strongest
argument for believing that their power is of the same nature *,

From the various facts stated or referred to in the foregoing paper, the fol-
lowing inferences appear to be unavoidable ;â€”That the circulation is main-
tained by the combined power of the heart and blood-yessels; and that the
power of both is a muscular power.
