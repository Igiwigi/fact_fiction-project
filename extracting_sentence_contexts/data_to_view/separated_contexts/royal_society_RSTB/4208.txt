The Staffordshire specimen also appears to
be quite distinct from the Calamites (cruciatus) quinquenarius, yar. Déhlensis of
Srerzeu,t from the Lower Permian of Saxony. In view of these facts, and especially the great difference in the age of the
Continental specimens, I prefer to regard the present plant as a new species,
C. Cannockensis. Occurrence :—Grey Productives, Top Hard (=Wyrley Deep, or 8 ft.) seam at
No. 3 Pit, West Cannock Colliery, Hednesford, South Staffordshire.
