106 MR. BRODIE ON MYRICIN.

combination with this unctuous acid, the presence of which is very probably due to
another source.

This alcohol may possibly, as well as the melissin, be combined with palmitic acid,
or it may be in some altogether different form in the wax. Even after long boiling
with alcohol, the myricin has a slight wax smell, and it is possible that this unctuous
acid is the product of the action of potash upon the oil which is one of the con-
stitnents of the wax, and from which I have in fact procured an acid of this nature.
This oil, or rather grease, which was analysed by Lewr, is a yery curious substance.
The other constituents of the wax are, in a pure state, inodorous and crystalline,
and to it the wax owes its tenacity and peculiar smell. I have made some experi-
ments as to its nature, and procured from it also an acid and an unsaponifiable
substance; I will not, however, here enter upon the matter, hoping at some future
time to resume its investigation.

I must not omit to mention, with reference to the bees'-wax from Ceylon, of which
I spoke in a former paper, and which contained no cerotic acid, that it possesses all
the general characters of the other portion of the wax. Like the impure myricin, it
contains more than one 8ubstance. The wax itself has a melting-point of 65%5.
When digested with ether in the cold, a portion is taken up by the ether, and a residue
