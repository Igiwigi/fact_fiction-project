However, the
experiments of Robertson & Cook (1913), and others, have shown that yield always occurs
at the upper yield stress, and the experimental work described in the present paper provides
further confirmation of this point. It is well known that the occurrence of yield in mild steel is accompanied by the formation
of Liiders lines. It seems probable, as suggested by Muir & Binnie (1926) and others, that
the material within the Liiders lines has undergone a considerable amount of slip, and has
in fact strained to the point Â¢ in figure 1. The surrounding material is still entirely elastic,
and is sustaining only the lower yield stress. This elastic material is therefore subjected to
