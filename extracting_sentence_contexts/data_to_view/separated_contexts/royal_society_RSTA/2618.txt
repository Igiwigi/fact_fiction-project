Thus our equations would make the spheroidal mass of incompressible fluid first

become unstable when pus = ‘400, but these equations have only been obtained on

the supposition that hee is so small that its squares may be neglected, a supposition

which is now seen @ posteriori to be hardly admissible. Probably the results
obtained are qualitatively true, but quantitatively unreliable. In point of fact the

first point of bifurcation for an incompressible mass, instead of being given by
we ep ‘400, is known to be given by the widely different value La "1871. 2ae 2ao

Our analysis has nevertheless proved rigorously the point which is really most
important, namely, that there can be no point of bifurcation at all for quite small
values of = . At the same time, since the question of when and how a rotating mass
first becomes unstable is one of considerable importance, I have attempted to obtain
a more reliable investigation than the preceding.
