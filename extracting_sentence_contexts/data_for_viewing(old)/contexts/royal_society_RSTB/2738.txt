52 MR. F. H. A. MARSHALL ON THE GESTROUS CYCLE AND THE

mountain breed, and which, although thriving well and attaining their maximum size
on dry lowland pasture, are hardy and active, living naturally on dry heaths or bare
mountain pastures (WALLACE, 1893).

Although most foreign sheep resemble the majority of British breeds in showing
varying degrees of polycestrum, but a single sexual season annually, AristorLe long
ago recorded the fact that “in some places where the weather is warm and fine, and
food is abundant,” sheep may have young twice a year. When this is the case the
spring sexual season should probably be regarded as of the nature of a continuation
of a series of dicestrous cycles which started at the previous autumn sexual season,
but were interrupted by gestation. A breeder of Dorset Horn sheep in the Isle of
Wight informs me that in the absence of the ram cestrus may keep on recurring at
regular intervals in the ewes from the autumn sexual season (during which they are
normally allowed to become pregnant) onwards until the following spring. It would
appear, however, that in these sheep there is a short ancestrous period (in the absence
of gestation) during part of the summer, but that its length is a variable quantity,
depending upon whether or not there has been a winter gestation, and being further
complicated by such influences as lactation, food supply, and climatic conditions.
