the subject has been wilfully misrepresented by those natu-
ralists, who have stated it as a fact. Yet how careful should
we be in the investigation of all subjects in natural history,
which may captivate, by their apparent novelty !

If birds crept into holes and crevices to hibernate, would
they not, like quadrupeds, creep out again in a languid state,


on the migration of birds. 15

their fat all absorbed, and their bodies emaciated ? We see
this fact exemplified in the hedge-hog, one of the most re-

every situation where nature could find room for it. This fat
is its only source of nutrition for the winter, which, by
