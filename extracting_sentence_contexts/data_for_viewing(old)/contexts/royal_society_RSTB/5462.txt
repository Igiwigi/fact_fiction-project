the auditory capsule in the chondrocranium of Sorex. Anteriorly, the alicochlear com-
missure, as a répresentative of the trabecula, marks a place which can be regarded as
a medial limit to the capsular material. Proceeding straight backwards from this
spot, mounting the roof of the cochlear capsule (and paying no attention to the basi-
cochlear sulcus, which marks the position of the basicochlear fissure of other forms),
one arrives at the anterior root of the suprafacial commissure. This is a remnant of
the original side wall of the skull, and as such, might be taken to mark another medial
limit to the capsular material. Still further back, in the same line prolonged, is the
apertura medialis of the recessus scales tympani. ‘his is a part of the fissura metotica,
and consequently there is no doubt that it marks the medial boundary of the auditory
capsule.

The result of this inquiry is to show that Gaupp’s theory would fit the facts provided
that a satisfactory explanation could be found for the basicochlear fissure in those
forms which possess it. ‘The presence of the basicochlear fissure might be regarded
as a developmental adaptation to a condition which is shared by all the higher mammals,
viz., the great increase in the size of the brain, for expansion of the cranial cavity in
the hinder region of the skull can only be obtained by pushing out the auditory capsule.
Since the ductus cochlearis is an integral part of the membranous labyrinth, it is con-
ceivable that when the latter together with its capsule were displaced to the side, the
cartilaginous envelope of the ductus cochlearis accompanied it, and became separated
from the rest of the basal plate.

But the basicochlear fissure may, on the other hand, be regarded as a remnant of
the original basicapsular fenestra separating the auditory capsule from the basal plate,
