be applied to a, protoxide as to a metal;
and in the case of the nitromuriatic acid; when the nitrous acid
is decomposed to assist in the formation of a metallic muriate,
the body disengaged (nitrous gas, ).is known to be in a high
state of oxygenation. Ke


68 Mr. Davy's Experiments on

That nitrogene is not a metal in the form of gas, is almost
demonstrated by the nature of the fusible substance from am-
monia, and (eyen supposing no reference to be made to the
experiments detailed in this paper,) the general analogy of
chemistry would lead to the notion of its being compounded. Should it be established by Å¿uture researches that hydro-
gene is a protoxide of ammonium, ammonia a deutoxide, and
nitrogene a tritoxide of the same metal, the theory of chemis-
try would attain a happy simplicity, and the existing arrange-
ments would harmonize with all the new facts. The class of
pure inflammable bases, would be metals capable of alloying
with cach other, and of combining with protoxides. Some of
the bases would be known only.
