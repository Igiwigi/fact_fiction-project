During the two shorter intervals (1 and 2), the calculated
period of the third mode is respectively longer and shorter than that for the whole interval. The result clearly depends greatly on the value assigned to (p,;â€”p,). The observations
in figure 10 were not extended long enough to decide whether a progressive decrease
in period of the third mode did in fact occur. We may now examine the partition of the modes between the two interfaces. Using
equation (A 14), it is possible to calculate the ratio, f, of vertical displacement of the upper
to that of the lower interface for each mode.
