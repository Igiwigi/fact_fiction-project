Further,
a numerical comparison between LBM with the herein given equilibrium population and LBM
with an extended Navier-Stokes equilibrium is given in [31]. From a formal point of view, the
inclusion of extended equilibria into the current framework would require extended perturbation
terms for the steps AP in the proposed ansatz (§3), effecting additional terms on the right-hand
side of (3.7).

5. Lattice Boltzmann equation—numerical examples

The generality of the herein presented ansatz is reflected in the fact that by varying model
parameters in the constructed DVBE, we can reach either an advection-diffusion equation, a
diffusion equation, or a hyperbolic conservation law. The following numerical tests investigate
the applicability of the stability constraints derived above and suggest approximation orders to


the TEQ. An in-depth analysis of accuracy and consistency in each step from TEQ to LBE is not
carried out, though subject to follow-up research.
