It is easily seen that the combination of (248) and (249) is continuous across 4 -}- 4) = 7.
For on this line @ = 7, and from (207)
sin y —_ 2 ; (250)
sin ap, (sin yf +sin 4,9) L,(cos Oy) L,(cos@) — siny+sin ap,
so that (248) becomes

the discontinuity in which just balances that in (249). The complete field on 0-4-6, = 7 1s

The formula (252) is a generalization of (165), the two being obviously equivalent when

p.(siny) = 1.
