others like it had an extraordinarily great influence that I was able to obtain the

Suniform mode in the taking of every curve. I found that after the wire had

Sproducing no immediately visible effect, affected most materially the subsequent
behaviour of the wire. Indeed the curve of magnetisation under any given load
Sdepends not only on the load actually present, but on any changes of load which have

Fromoval of all visible magnetisation, the Joad were accidentally raised to 4 kilos. and
21 kilo. then removed, the resulting curve was very sensibly different from what it
Spould have been if the weight had simply been raised to and kept at 3 kilos., and this,
Ftoo, in spite of the fact that the wire had been frequently snbjected to more than
Ffour times that amount of stress, and was therefore in a mechanically stable state.
