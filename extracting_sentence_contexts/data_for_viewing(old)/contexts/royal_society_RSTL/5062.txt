Experiment 3.—Cat. Prussic acid, swallowed. Between the bile in the gall-
bladder and blood flowing from the vena porta; the latter slightly positive. . Between
the bile in the gall-bladder and blood flowing from the vena cava inferior, in the
chest ; the latter positive 5®.

Experiment 4.—Cat. Prassic acid, swallowed. The electrodes were inserted into
the gall-bladder and vena cava inferior in the chest ; the latter positive 4® or 5?, and
as the blood flowed out from the wound the motion of the needle increased. Between
the gall-bladder and vena porta, the latter slightly positive.

Several other experiments might be related proving the same conclusions, but as the
fact may not be dispnted, we shall state, in a general manner, the other circuits that
were formed ; viz. between clots of blood and pieces of liver; between the mucous
membrane of the intestines and the gall-bladder ; between the blood in the chest and
various parts of the abdomen ; one electrode was coated with bile, and then both of
the electrodes were dipped into the blood in the chest. It was generally found that
the electrode in contact with the blood was positive, but not always ; sometimes vibra-
tions of the needle only occurred, at other times the needle went as far as 80? or 90?
and then stopped. The motions of the needle presented quite a different character
to those observed when the bile in the gall-bladder and the blood flowing from the
vena cava inferior were formed into a circuit; the latter presented a steady character,
they could be depended upon ; whereas with the former a greater effect might be pro-
duced at first, and it would then cease, or perhaps go in the opposite direction.
