The analysis of this acid must, in future,
be attempted with the aid of complicated affinities. Thus, in
the masterly experiment of Mr. TENNANT, phosphorus, which
attracts oxygen less strongly than charcoal, by the intermedia-
tion of lime decomposes the, carbonic acid. Yet, led by the
analogy of this fact, its discoverer found that a similar artifice
did not succeed in decomposing the muriatic acid, * As vital
© air,” he observes, © is attracted by a compound of phosphorus
© and calcareous earth, more powerfully than by charcoal, I was
« desirous of trying their efficacy upon those acids which may
* from analogy be supposed to contain vital air, but which are
* not affected by the application of charcoal, With this intention,
* I made phosphorus pass/ through a compound of marine acid
