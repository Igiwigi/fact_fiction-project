probable that the latter is the correct explanation of the mode of production of the
phenomena under consideration.

That the muscles of the posterior extremity on the side of the lesion contract,
though less powerfully than do those of the opposite limb, is evidence that the same
degree of control is not exerted on al! the centres of the opposite cortex ; but it is
also possible that some of the spasm in the muscles of the posterior extremity on the
side of the lesion may originate in the cerebral cortex of the same side as the limb.

The way in which the convulsions are diminished, and tonus largely replaces clonus
during the muscular contractions which take place in the anterior extremity on the
side on which the posterior columns and their nuclei have been divided, are interesting
points, as is the fact that these differences become more pronounced after a series of
convulsions ; but in dealing with so much that is unfamiliar, it appears to me to be
better to record the facts without at present entering into any speculations as to
their significance.
