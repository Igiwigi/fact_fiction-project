the sound of the roaring of the mountain was at times acutely painful. As we shall
see later, there can be no doubt that the eruption of the great black cloud occasioned
a sudden rise of barometric pressure. Dr, Dunpar Hueugs, of Barrualli, was one of
the observers who noted this phenomenon.

Above all resounded the roaring of the mountain, and for about two and a half
hours in the afternoon the noise was terrible. Even at Kingstown it was so loud that
it resembled no sound with which the observers were familiar. Some compared it to
the discharge of an enormous gun, except that it was continuous and not intermittent,
and we were reminded that among the Caribs there were old traditions regarding the
“Great Gun of the Soufriére.” Most people described it, however, as having a long,
drawn-out, weird, unearthly character, recalling the roar of a wounded animal in
intense pain. It is a curious fact that most observers in St. Vincent state that it did
not seem to them to be made up of distinct detonations or reports, or if so, these were
so numerous as to be blended together without intermission. The sound, however,
rose and fell, being at times distinctly much louder than at others. At the same
time in Barbados, St. Lucia, Trinidad and elsewhere, the noises from the voleano were
compared to the reports of distant cannonading, and the intermittent nature of the
sound was one of its distinctive features.

The air also was laden with sulphurous fumes. Especially was this noticeable
during the passage overhead of the great black cloud, when the abundance of
sulphurous acid (and also sulphuretted hydrogen) was so great as to produce an
intense feeling of irritation and suffocation. Thereafter it seems to have been much
less, but continued more or less through the whole night. The sulphuretted hydrogen
