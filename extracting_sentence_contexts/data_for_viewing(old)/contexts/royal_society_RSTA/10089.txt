s have endeavoured throughout to keep my mind free from all preconceived notions.
Every one thus looking with unprejudiced eyes at the main facts must feel himself
‘2 drawn in opposite directions. On the one hand there is the evidence of the periodo-
gram which indicates almost decisively a new departure at the beginning of the
nineteenth century ; on the other hand we have the remarkable fact that WoLrer,
making use of all the data since 1610, deduced 11°124 years as the most probable
‘g period—a result identical with mine. Similarly Newcoms,* after a most careful
examination of the same records, arrives at a period of 11°13 years. It needs to be
é explained why the years in which, according to our results, the periodicity was
apparently absent do not affect the mean duration of the period, so that the same
value is obtained whether the time during which the periodicity is ea hypothesi
absent is included in the calculations or not. My first impression was that the
coincidence was partly a matter of accident and partly due to the fact that both
observers attached weights to the times of the observed maxima according to their
trustworthiness. The weights thus attached to the records of the last 70 years
naturally much exceeded those with which previous records were credited. Hence
the whole result might very well be found to depend on the later periods only.
When first writing out the account of my work, this was the view I took, and it was
only very gradually that I abandoned it. I am convinced now that it is untenable.

To put the reader into possession of all the facts, and to get at a clear view of the
subject, it seems advisable to state in detail the arguments which seemed to point to
the conclusion that the 11 years’ period was only of recent origin. In Table XIII. the
first column contains the times of sunspot maxima as copied from Wo.rFer’s tables.
The third column contains the intervals between two successive maxima. The fourth
