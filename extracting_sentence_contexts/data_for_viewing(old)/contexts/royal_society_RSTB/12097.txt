directly, fuelling the argument that models are underused by
stakeholders [6,7,10,11,15-17]. Reasons commonly cited for
this knowledge—practice gap include: (i) models do not address
stakeholder concerns, (ii) outputs cannot be clearly translated
into policy or intervention, (iii) processes are explained poorly
and/or are too esoteric, (iv) assumptions are considered inva-
lid, and (v) models lack intuitive interfaces that facilitate
stakeholder use [7,10,11,15—18]. These factors are compounded
by the fact that models are often developed without systematic
and transparent stakeholder input [11,15-17]. Essentially,
modelling becomes a top—down exercise driven by the develo-
pers, with limited opportunities for stakeholders to guide
model development, structure simulations or apply counter-
factual analysis. This presents a dilemma for the field of
epidemiological modelling, as models without stakeholder con-
fidence will be ineffective at addressing the environmental,
economic and social implications of disease [7,10,11].

Participatory research seeks to overcome this knowledge—
practice gap by involving stakeholders who could be affected
by research outcomes [15—17,19-22]. Owing to the rise of
