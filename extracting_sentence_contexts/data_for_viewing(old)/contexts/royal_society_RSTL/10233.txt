'= recently been shown by A. AGass1z,* most Teleostei acquire at, an early stage of their
S development heterocercal caudal fins, like those of Elasmobranchii and the Chondro-
© 8tean Ganoids ; but in the course of their further growth the dorsal lobe partly
Z atrophies, and partly disappears as such, owing to the great prominence acquired by the
A ventral lobe. A. portion of the dorsally flexed notochord and of the cartilage or bone
- replacing or investing it remains, however, as an indication of the original dorsal lobe,
© though it does not, project backwards beyond the level of the end of the ventral lobe,
- which in these types forms the terminal caudal fin.

The true significance of the dorsally flexed portion of the vertebral axis was firsb
 elewrly stated by Huxriey,t but as A. AGassz has fairly pointed out in the paper

already quoted, this fact does not in any way militate against the view put forward by
