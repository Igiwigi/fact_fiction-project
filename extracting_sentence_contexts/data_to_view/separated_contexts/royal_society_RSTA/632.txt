I need, however, to
define causality. Causality as understood in this article (and by Schrédinger here) is an ontological category—
part of reality. It relates to the behaviour of physical systems whose evolution is defined by the fact
that the state of a given system is, at least as idealized by a given theory and model, determined at



all moments of time by their state at a particular moment of time, indeed at any given moment of 1s |
time. This concept is in accord with Kant’s principle of causality, which states (this statement of the
principle has been commonly used since) that if an event takes place, it has a [determinable] cause
of which it is an effect [22, pp. 305, 308]. Quantum phenomena violate this principle, because no
determinable event or process could ever be established as the necessary cause of a given event,
and only statistical correlations between certain events could be ascertained.
