Before the experiments of M. VoLTa on the electricity
excited by the mere contact of metals were published, I had
to a certain extent adopted this opinion ; but the new facts
immediately proved that another power must necessarily be
concerned ; for it was not possible to refer the electricity
exhibited by the apposition of metallic surfaces to any che-
mical alterations, particularly as the effect is more distinct in
a dry atmosphere, in which even the most oxidable metals do
not change, than in a moist one, in which many metals un-
dergo chemical alteration.

Other facts likewise s0on occurred demonstrative of the
same thing. In the VoLTaic combination of diluted nitrous
acid, zinc and copper, as is well known, the side of the zinc
exposed to the acid is positive. But in combinations of zinc,
water and diluted nitric acid, the surface exposed to the acid
is negative; though if the chemical action of the acid on the
zinc had been the cause of the effect, it ought to be the same
in both cases.

In mere cases of chemical change likewise electricity is
never exhibited. Iron burnt in oxygene gas, properly con-
nected with a condensing electrometer, gives no charge to it
during the process, Nitre and charcoal deflagrated in com-
