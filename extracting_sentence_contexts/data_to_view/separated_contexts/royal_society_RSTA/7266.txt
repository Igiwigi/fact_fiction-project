Making these substitutions, and evaluating as usual, we get

Considering now the two parts of SS for given w, we see that the amplitudes are in the
ratio | ,¥|/|¥,| = 82(A+-2z)/2,*, which is small when (h+-z)/x is small. The phase of yz
exceeds that of —y, by +-4$7 according as #(w) = 0, so that the amplitude of the sum of
—y,and ,, differs from | y, | by a small quantity of the second order if (4 + z)/xis first order. This corresponds to the fact that with plane waves for angles near grazing incidence no
energy goes into SP, SS being reflected with unchanged amplitude but changed phase
(Jeffreys 19265). The above evaluation of ,y-, differs in one important respect from previous approximations
on I’,. Whereas approximations obtained from I’, hold (subject to the conditions stated)
as w approaches and crosses the imaginary axis of w, (11-27) holds only as long as I’, is not
too near I,.
