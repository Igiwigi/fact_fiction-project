This method was tested on three children with
ASD, and achieved good emotion recognition performance
especially for happiness and sadness. Robust facial expression recognition is technically challen-
ging, especially if there is no control over illumination
conditions and the age range of the intended participants is
large; the latter is particularly problematic if young children
are considered to be included, as facial expression datasets
generally contain only adult participants. The technical chal-
lenges are compounded by the fact that expression
recognition needs to be carried with real-time processing
speed on a standard computer. With TeachMeEQ, we
intended to do multiple live demonstrations in different
locations and include children as well as adult participants. This required us to build a robust facial expression recog-
nition pipeline.
