Geological Position, —The baths of Nero, commonly called Sudatorij di Tritoli,
occur close to the shore of the bay of Baja near Pozzuoli. They consist of yapour
baths cut from the solid tufaceous rock of volcanic formation. Perhaps the most re-
markable fact connected with their geological position, is the proximity of the Monte
Nuovo, elevated by volcanic explosion in 1538, It is singular that the spring imme-
diately to be mentioned should not have been affected by that circumstance ; for
there is every reason to believe that it has flowed since the time of the Romans. B. Specialties, $c.—I have very fully described the origin and circumstances of
this remarkable spring in my series of papers on the Bay of Naples in the Edinburgh
Journal of Science.
