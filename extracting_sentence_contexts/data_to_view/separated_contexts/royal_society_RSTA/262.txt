Of the two interlacing nets in
figure 22, the first (shown in full lines) has four nodal
points in the quadrant for which residual forces have
to be liquidated by a use of the standard ‘pattern’,
the second (shown in broken lines) has two. These
points are indicated by full and open circles re-
spectively: the remainder are too near the boundary
to permit relaxation. On both nets liquidation is easy, and could be
made complete if this were thought worth while: in
fact it is not worth while until the ‘selvedge values’
(§22) have been amended, so on these coarse nets
the work was done in short stages during which,
alternately, interior points were relaxed in ac-
cordance with the standard pattern, ‘selvedge
points’ in the light of rough plottings as described
in §§ 20-2. Figure 22 records the accepted values, €——
multiplied by 104 in order to obviate decimals. Figure 23a records accepted values of y at nodal
points of a finer net comprising both of the inter-
lacing nets of figure 22, and figure 234 records values for a net which similarly in-
terlaces the net of figure 23a.
