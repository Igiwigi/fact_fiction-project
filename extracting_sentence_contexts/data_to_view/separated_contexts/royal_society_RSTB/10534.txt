If both fastigial nuclei are lesioned in a monkey, saccades the right EBN and IBN (red line), which chokes off the drive to

the ipsiversive fastigial nucleus that stops the saccade on target. However, although saccades overshoot the target, they do

eventually stop. 5. Distributed motor error

What mechanism might then sto pa hypermetric saccade?
