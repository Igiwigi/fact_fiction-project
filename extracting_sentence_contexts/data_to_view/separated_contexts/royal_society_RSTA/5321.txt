On this basis, a stochastic model has to be more challenging
than a deterministic model, although, at the same time, some computational approximations will
perform less badly with a stochastic model than with a deterministic one.

4. Uncertain static parameters

We fully expect 0 to be uncertain; worse, it is often ill-defined, except as an instrumental quantity
that we introduce in order to construct a prior distribution over X. This makes it hard to specify
a prior distribution 7 (@), but in fact this is not our main difficulty. Q’ 9” 6”
