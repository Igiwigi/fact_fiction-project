Cobb’s work had an enormous influence on Ronald Aylmer
Fisher (1890-1962 [45]; figure 1e), who is traditionally—
though incorrectly—credited as the originator of the theory
of the rarer-sex effect [46,47]. Fisher is explicit in crediting
Cobb’s 1913 paper on Human fertility [34] as providing the
inspiration for his own theory of the decline of civilizations,
articulated in the latter chapters of his 1930 book The genetical
theory of natural selection [37]. And although he does not expli-
citly credit Cobb for the sex-ratio argument that he gives
earlier in the same book, it is beyond reasonable doubt that
Fisher was aware of Cobb’s sex-ratio paper. Edwards [9] com-
piles convincing circumstantial evidence, including, for
example, the fact that Cobb’s paper appeared in the same jour-
nal issue as two book reviews contributed by Fisher [48,49].
Fisher’s major contribution to understanding of the
rarer-sex effect is to give it a more formal foundation by pro-
viding a proper mathematical account of—and name for—the
concept of reproductive value. This is done firstly in an article
on The actuarial treatment of official birth records published in
1927 in The Eugenics Review [36], and also in The genetical
theory of natural selection [37, pp. 27-30], again without
making any reference to Cobb’s work. Fisher then gives
what is essentially Cobb’s formulation of the rarer-sex
effect—with one crucial difference [37, pp. 142-143]:
