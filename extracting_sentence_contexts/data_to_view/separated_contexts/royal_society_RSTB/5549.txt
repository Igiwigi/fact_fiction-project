Now suppose that on account of some change in the
meteorology of the place the perennial streams become intermittent, liable either to
break up into a series of pools and puddles which may dry up altogether or become rapid
torrents generated by a single shower (such is the habitat of the funnel-mouthed larve). The tempestuous waters of torrents contain a high percentage of dissolved oxygen and it
is known that animals tend to reduce their respiratory organs under such a condition. Tn fact, Dopps and Hisaw (‘ Ecology,’ V, pp. 262-271, 1924a) have been able to show a
“definite correlation between gill area and oxygen content of the water.” So when
these tadpoles with reduced gills were left in pools and puddles with an ever-decreasing
quantity of oxygen dissolved in the water, they would naturally come to the surface
for inhaling the atmospheric air, and this habit would ultimately lead to the lungs
becoming once more functional for respiration.
