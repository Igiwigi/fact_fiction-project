The fact, however, for which our previous experiments had not prepared us, was that

the electromotive change accompanying the beat of the ventricle is not always

composed of two phases, it is sometimes expressed in its photograph as a single

variation (Photos. 8 and 4). This then is the fact ; our opinion concerning it is that,
having regard to the rapidity with which the instrument may be shown to act to very
brief changes in very

rapid succession, the single variation observed under these
circumstances is proof of a practically single and simultaneous change taking place

monophasic, and such as to indicate that the apex became negative to the base at each beat. (Apex
