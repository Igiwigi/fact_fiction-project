But of the facts observed the chief was the very local effect
which would be obtained by varying the point stimulated. Thus stimulation of a point
1 millim. centrally or laterally of a given point often produced an entirely different
resulting movement, or no response at all, which fact is clearly of much importance in
showing that with the above strength of current the restriction of the stimulus to
one point must be sufficiently well obtained. 2. Mechanical.

_ As a means of controlling the observations derived from electrical excitation,
mechanical stimulation was sometimes employed in examining the nerve roots, and
was evoked by pinching the tissues with fine forceps.
