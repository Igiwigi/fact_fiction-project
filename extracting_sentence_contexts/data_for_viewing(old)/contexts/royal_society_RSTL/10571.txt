potass and phosphoric acid. Of silica, plot 13 furnished rather less in the later than
in the earlier years ; but whilst in the earlier years the two plots yielded practically
the same amount, the amount annually taken up fell off in the later years very con-
siderably on plot 9, but much less on plot 13; so that the increased yield of silica

over plot 9 was all in the later years. Over the 20 years, however, the excess of
silica, taken up where the straw was used, was only about one-eighth as much as it
would contain ; and the fact that the excess was all in the later years is consistent
with the supposition that the silica of the straw would be only very gradually available.
A similar argument applies to the increased assimilation of nitrogen, which was much
more in the later than in the earlier years.

An examination of the comparative botany of the two plots will afford useful
evidence in aid of the explanation of these results.

The Table LXXIL., pp. 1348-9, shows the percentage of each species at each separa-
& tion, the produce per acre, the increase over that without manure ; and, finally, the
Sincrease or decrease over that on plot 9 with the same manure, excepting the straw.
2 As with the ammonia-salts and mineral manure without the straw, 80 with it, we
have, but even in a greater degree, a very marked reduction in the number of species
