hydrogen to- unite to the potassium, and the substance quits
the potassium to unite to the hydrogen.

The new substance, I find, is not decomposed when Voltaic
sparks are taken in it in its gaseous tate from ignited points
of charcoal : at first there are white fumes, probably from the
action of moisfure or hydrogen in charcoal, on the substance;
but these fumes s0on cease, and when the tube in which the
experiment is made is cooled, the substance appears unaltered.

From all the facts that have been stated, there is every
reason to consider this new substance as an undecompounded
body. In its specific gravity, lustre, the high number in which
it enters into combination and colour, it resembles the metals;
but in all its chemical agencies it is more analogous to oxygen
and chlorine; it is a non-conductor of electricity, and possesses,
like these bodies, the negative electrical energy with respect
to metals, inflammable and alkaline substances, and hence
when combined with these substances in aqueous solution and
electrized in the Voltaic circuit, it separates at the positive
surface ; but it has a positive energy with respect to chlorine,
for when united to chlorine in the compound acid I have de-
scribed, (page 78), it separates from the chlorine at the
