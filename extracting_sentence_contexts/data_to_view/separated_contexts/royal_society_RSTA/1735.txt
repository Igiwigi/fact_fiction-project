Turbulent hydrodynamics for laboratory astrophysics and fundamental high-
energy-density hydrodynamics

(a) Laboratory astrophysics

The opportunities offered by high-power lasers to mimic astrophysical phenomena in the
laboratory were recognized in the late 1990s [118,119]. Similarity scaling based on Euler equations
[120,121] has been improved to include the effects of radiation [122]. In fact, the advent of MJ high
power lasers has enabled a booming new field of research in which astrophysical environments
can be scaled down to laboratory dimensions yet preserve the essential physics via self-similar
transformations of the governing equations. The stabilizing effect of radiation on the RTI has been
demonstrated on NIF in conditions relevant for young supernovae remnants [123,124]. This is the
culmination of a long thought research project [125-127].
