This is a very significant failure in the ambition to describe natural phenomena
in a single framework. Worse, even in partnership with general relativity, the rotation curves of
galaxies, weak lensing of light and the large-scale structure of the universe cannot be described
without introducing ‘Dark Matter’, for which the SM does not contain a compelling candidate
(though the possibility of strongly bound composite SM states is still discussed, e.g. [60]). The
low level of CP violation possible from SM mechanisms has not been reconciled with the gross
violation inherent in the fact that the observable universe seems to consist overwhelmingly of
matter rather than antimatter. And finally, it is probably apparent from the preceding sections
that the SM contains quite a lot of parameters with seemingly arbitrary, but suggestive, values. These include some, such as the Higgs mass, that look unnaturally ‘fine tuned’, to the extent that
it is very tempting to think that they are fixed by some so-far unknown symmetry or principle
inherent in a larger theory, of which the SM is just a part.
