It is well to measure the degree of inconsistency,
to discover whether it is so great as to imply that the population was heterogeneous. ON CLIMATE AND TSETSE FLIES 183

The degree of inconsistency between cages at a single humidity may be appropriately
measured by z? ; we propose to test the hypothesis that the flies in all the cages at
one humidity were drawn from a homogeneous population. The x? formula gives
a measure of the divergence between the ‘“ observed” facts and what would be
“expected ”? on this hypothesis. An example will make this clearer.
