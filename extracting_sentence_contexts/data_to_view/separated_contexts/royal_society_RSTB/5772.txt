No difficulty is experienced in obtaining embryos
in which the heart is beating, and blood formation in the vascular area invariably occurs,
but there frequently seems to be a maladjustment between the two, so that embryos
are often obtained in which the heart is beating, probably not very strongly, whilst the
blood instead of circulating in the blood vessels, is concentrated in large masses in the
posterior part of the area vasculosa. Secondly, in those embryos in which the circulation functions properly, it is nearly
always found that after 12-24 hours the heart slows down and stops, and the embryo
dies. It is possible that in such cases a change of medium would suflice to prolong life
for a time, but the facts rather suggest that there is something lacking in the conditions
of cultivation for embryos of this age, since if an embryo with a functional circulation
is removed from the egg and explanted in vitro it rarely survives for more than 24 hours. Fig. 26, Plate 23, shows an embryo which had 9 somites when transplanted and which
was cultivated for 43 hours: this specimen shows almost the latest stage of development
to which embryos attained in these experiments.
