That this is 8ometimes the ease there can be no doubt, as the
tissuc bears optical indications of having been strained at the line of blocking. But that this cannot be the
explanation in all eases is proved by the occurrence of those numerous gradations in different parts of tho same
tissne-mass, both with regard to excitability of tismne-areas and intimacy of physiological connexions. MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUS®E. 717

facts to be detailed in this subsection. For it it can be proved that the contractile
tisxues of Aurelia are pervaded by tissue-tracts which display the essentially nervous
function of establishing what I have termed excitational continuity between different
parts, then I think we may be more prepared to believe that the passage of contractile
waves depends on the presence of tissue-tracts presenting a nervous character, For
the evidence being already in fayour of the hypothesis that the pasxage of contrac-
tile waves depends on the presence of certain differentiated elements whose function is
presumably nervous, such evidence would be further strengthened if it could be shown
that in the very same tissue there occur other differentiated elements whose function is
demonstrably nervous. Now that such elements as the las; mentioned do occur in all
parts of the excitable tissues of Aurelia aurits is a fact concerning which there can be
no question.
