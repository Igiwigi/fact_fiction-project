At the same time an account was given in, and published by the Academy,
of new marks which were made in the same years, 1820-21, to record the level of
the sea observed at the time of the survey. Notwithstanding the numerous proofs recorded of the change of leyel, and the
high authorities who had declared in its fayour, I continued, in common with many
others, to entertain some doubts respecting the reality of the phenomenon, partly
because I 8uspected that it might be explained by reference to more ordinary causes,
snch as 8ome of those aboye mentioned, and partly because it appeared to me im-
probable that such great effects of subterranean expansion should take place in
countries which, like Sweden and Norway, have been remarkably free within the
times of history from violent earthquakes. The slow, constant, and insensible ele-
vation of a large tract of land, is a process s0 different from the sudden rising or
falling known to have accompanied, in certain regions, the intermittent action of
earthquakes and yolcanos, that the fact appeared to require more than an ordinary
weight of evidence for its confirmation. I am willing, however, to confess, after

reviewing all the statements published previously tomy late tour for and against the
reality of the change of level in Sweden, that my scepticism appears to have been
unwarrantable ; but it will not be disputed that too many proofs cannot be accumu-
lated to substantiate s0 remarkable a phenomenon. :

I propoxse, therefore, to lay before the Royal Society the observations which I made
during the summer of 1834, with a view of satisfying myself in regard to the data ap-
pealed to in support of the elevation of parts both of the eastern and western shores of
Sweden. As much of the evidence could only have been derived from personal inter-
course with the inhabitants, it may be proper to mention that I was accompanied
throughout my excursion by a well-informed Swede, Mr.Jouxsox, who by his thorough
knowledge of the English language was well qualified to assist me as interpreter.
