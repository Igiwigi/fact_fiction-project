This disturbance increases as it
progresses, and finally causes the jet to break. By directing the jeb against a flame,
or against a hearing orifice, it is readily perceived that such disturbances travel along
the jet-path with a velocity which is not that of ound in air. In fact, the 8ound
heard in the ear-piece resembles an echo of the disturbing sound. The disturbances produced by sounds of different pitch travel along the jet-path
with the same velocity. This is evident, since otherwise distinct reproduction of the
complex vibrations of speech at a distance from the orifice would be impossible.
