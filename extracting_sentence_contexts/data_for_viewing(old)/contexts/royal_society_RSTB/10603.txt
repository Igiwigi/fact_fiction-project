biochemical activity of many is unclear [12]. In vitro assays of
replication in host cells illustrate the difficulty: only 10 of
these effector proteins produce robust replication phenotypes
upon deletion [13], limiting options for traditional genetic
dissection of function. Despite a lack of clear in vitro pheno-
type, many of these effectors are in fact attenuated in whole
animal models of disease [14], though some characterized
effectors fail to produce robust replication phenotypes
either in vivo or in vitro. Additionally, animal systems have
clear limitations if one wants to analyse many different
candidate virulence-related genes: beyond basic logistical
requirements for housing and upkeep, isolation of infected
tissue is difficult and time-consuming, not to mention the
ethical concerns involved. Even at their best, animal models
only capture aspects of human disease [15,16], and for
some important pathogens well-developed animal models
do not exist.
