of © The Optical Properties of the Cyanurets of Platinum and Magnesia, and of
Barytes and Platinum,” salts which he had received from M. Haipinces of Vienna,
The notice is chiefly devoted to the properties of the reflected light; but with
respect to the latter of the salts, Sir Davip remarks that © it possesses the property
of internal dispersion, the dispersed light being a brilliant green, while the trans-
mitted light is yellow.” Although the distinetion between true internal dispersion
and opalescence was not at the time understood, there could be little doubt from the
nature of the case that the internal dispersion mentioned by Sir David BrewsTeR
was, in fact, an instance of the former of these phenomena ; but I could not try for
want of a specimen of the salt. Some months ago I received from M. Haipinctr a
Specimen of the first of the salts mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph,
namely M. Quaprar's cyanide of platinum and magnesium, a alt of great optical
interest on account of the remarkable metallic reflexion which it exhibits. On
examining the salt, I was greatly interested by finding that it was highly sensitive,
the fluorescent light being red. This induced me to form some of Gmz1aN's platino-
cyanide of potassium, and I found that the blue light which this salt exhibits in
certain aspects is, in fact, due to fluorescence, a property which the salt possesses in
an eminent degree. Having afterwards received some of the same salt pure from
Professor GREGoRy, I applied it to the formation, on a small scale, of the platino-
cyanides of calcium, barium, strontium, and two or three others. The three salts
last named, of which the second is that mentioned by Sir David Brews, are all
