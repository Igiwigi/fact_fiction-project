past, listened to the actual results of medical and pathological observations of
importance, that I should wish to enter in detail into the results of the actual
observations which I have carried out by means of the method of automatic
photographic registration which I have described, for, as is indicated by the title
of this paper, I am dealing at present with methods rather than with results. I may,
however, be permitted to point out and to illustrate by certain of the curves which
I have obtained, that the method of photographic registration has revealed the fact
that the temperature of the body in any given region is ceaselessly changing, and in
a manner hitherto unsuspected, doubtless in consequence of constant changes in the
activity of the great vaso-motor centre and its subordinates. These changes are
much more strikingly seen in the curves of the diurnal changes in the rectal
temperature of a healthy man, which are not reproduced in this paper, but which will

be subsequently published.
