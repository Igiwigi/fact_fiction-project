The equation (17°02) is
identical, except as regards notation, with that given in my first memoir on the
kinetic theory (loc. cit., p. 451). When », = 0, the formula reduces to

oe SRT 1 _ _5RT

which is the first approximation to the coeflicient of viscosity of a simple gas
composed entirely of molecules of the first kind. Some idea of the accuracy of
(17°02) as a first approximation may be gained from the fact that for a simple gas
the error (7.c., of (17°03)) amounts to only 1°6 per cent. for rigid elastic spherical
molecules, and less for n“ power centres of force (¢f. my second memoir, loc. cit., § 11),
the first approximation being too small. How the error varies with »,: », cannot be
stated without carrying the calculation further, but it is probable that it is always
of the same order of magnitude, 1 or 2 per cent. A second approximation to x,
would replace the last factor of (17°02) by the quotient of one homogeneous quartic
