We have performed an extensive numerical exploration of the profiles of travelling breathers
when q varies in the interval (7/2,7). We have observed a local drop in the tail size close to
v = 1.05, where tail size over breather amplitude is close to 1.6 x 10-3. At this local minimum, the
energy density |a,,+1(0) — ay(0)|? in the tail is extremely small (of the order of 10-16, i.e. machine
precision). This value of v corresponds to 6 close to 0, i.e. the solution is close to a solitary wave
(03.4 x 1074 and q ~ 2.33). This result suggest that strictly localized solitary waves exist in the


DpS equation (1.4) with p=2.5. Another local drop in tail size occurs close to v = 0.3, but the
phenomenon is less clear. Indeed, in this region where breather velocity v is relatively small, tail
size tends to be small for all values of v. This is consistent with the fact that static breathers (case
v =0) are strictly localized [46].

5. Discussion

We have derived several amplitude equations to approximate slowly modulated periodic waves
in the DpS equation with nonlinearity exponent close to unity. These models provide analytical
approximations of travelling breather solutions with superexponential spatial decay (either
Gaussian or with compact support). From a numerical point of view, we have computed exact
travelling breather solutions for p €(2,4] and compared them to the approximate solutions,
observing convergence when p —> 2. Travelling breathers computed numerically are generally =
superposed on a small non-vanishing oscillatory tail, except in special cases when they are close 3
to strictly localized solitary waves. In the vibro-impact limit when p becomes large, we have 1B
