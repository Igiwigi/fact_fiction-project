When placed
underwater, the treated hydrophilic mesh exhibited oil contact angles of 153° and droplets were
found to roll easily from the tilted surface. When an oil—-water mixture was poured onto the mesh,
the water permeated through the mesh while the oil remained on top. Although this configuration
helps to reduce the impact of oil fouling, the fact that the surface is only superoleophobic
underwater limits its application. Brown & Bhushan [17] created a superoleophobic/superhydrophilic mesh surface by
combining the chemistry of the fluorosurfactant with hierarchical roughness using the layer-by-
layer technique described earlier. Bhushan & Martin [18] used the nanoparticle/binder coating
with an over layer of fluorosurfactant.
