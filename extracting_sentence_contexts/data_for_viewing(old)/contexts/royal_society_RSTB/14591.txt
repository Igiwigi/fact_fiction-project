(d) Analysis
The ‘ImerTest’ package [48] was used to analyse the data.
The model included two fixed effects (the Valence of the target
(positive or negative valence) and its valence Congruency with
the responses (Cong0: no congruency; Cong1: one congruent
response; Cong2: two congruent responses)) and the interaction
between Valence and valence Congruency. We also included as
random effects the intercept per participant (accounting for their
variability), the slope per participant (accounting for the possi-
bility that the effect of the fixed factors is not the same for all
participants), and the by-item random intercept (accounting for
the fact that some items might be more difficult than others). The
MuMiIn R package [60] was used to compute a PseudoR2 (see
also [61]), which indicates that our statistical model explained
22% of the variance with a medium to large effect size (f2 = 0.28)
according to Cohen’s conceptualization [62]. A post hoc power
calculation test (with the pwr.f2.test function in R, within the pwr
package) showed that our sample of 30 participants is enough to
have a statistical power of 0.63 (p < 0.05).

The output of the model is presented in electronic
supplementary material, appendix SIC, table SC1.
