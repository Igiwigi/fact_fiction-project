All time-invariant nonlinear feedback controllers that can be written in the form f(t) =
g(O(E- 1), A(t — t)) can be reduced to proportional-derivative (PD) feedback after linearization
if the function g is smooth in both of its arguments. Thus, we limit our discussion to delayed PD
types of feedback, namely, the feedback takes the form

F(t) =—kp0(t — t) — ka(t — 0), (2.2)

where kp and kg are the proportional and the derivative control gains and r is the reaction time
delay.

Figure 1 shows a ‘pinned’ inverted pendulum controlled by time-delayed PD feedback. The
term ‘pinned’ refers to the fact that the position of the pivot point A of the inverted pendulum
is fixed and hence the only possible motions are those confined to the anterior-posterior plane
about the pivot. The fixed point of (2.1) with f(t) = 0 is a saddle. In order to analyse linear stability
when f(t) 40, it is useful to note that the period of the small-amplitude oscillations that occur
when the pendulum is hung downwards is Tp = 22/@n [38].

We focus on three causes of instability for human balance during quiet standing.

(a) Time delay

The observation that an inverted pendulum can be stabilized by time-delayed feedback draws
attention to the importance of the inter-relationship between t and on. This relationship is
summarized by the stabilizability parameter referred to as the critical delay, tert. An inverted
