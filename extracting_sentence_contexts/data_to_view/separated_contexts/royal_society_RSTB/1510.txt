By varying several other experiments of the same kind, precisely similar results
were obtained. From the foregoing results obtained by the excitation method, it may be justly
concluded that the normal relationship of any given posterior root (sensori-motor
reflex) to the segments in the spinal cord is that the destination of its root-fibres is
nerve centres in segments below the point of entry into the spinal cord. It now
remains to see how far this generalisation is justified by other facts obtained in other
ways. In the first place, the fact is of much interest that as long ago as 1847 CLAUDE
BERNARD found that the 6th and 7th posterior lumbar roots supplied the 7th anterior
root. Another point in the same direction is the fact that if the lumbar region be
cut across, then stimulation of the posterior external column, as high as the margin
of the cut surface of the lower portion, will give as intense a movement as before
section.
