February 14, 1850. Since the previous observations were communicated to the Secretary of the Royal
Society, I have been $0 fortunate as to obtain from the Oxford Clay of Wiltshire, a
Belemnite in which the two dorsal processes of the phragmocone are more perfectly
displayed than in any specimen hitherto discovered (sce Plate XXX.). From the rarity of such fossils, and their extreme fragility and perishable nature,

* I do not mean to aver that similar processes exist in every species of Belemnite, for it is probable that, as
in Ammonites, there may have been considerable diversity in the form and size of these appendages; and in
some s8pecies the basilar margin of the perisxtome may have been destitute of them : my remarks exclusively
refer to the species of Belemnites described in the text.

+ The facts dexcribed in the text are of course directly opposed to the views expressed in the following ex-
tract from the Philosophical Tranzsactions for 1844, p. 74: © The association of the spathose guards with crushed
phragmocones identical in 8{ructure with those in connection with the fossil ink-bags and muscular parts.”

+ Belemnites have recently been discovered in limestone in the Middle Island of New Zealand, by my eldest
son, Mr. Wares ManTELL.—See Geological Journal for August, 1850.

$ Belemnites first appear in the Lias, where they suddenly attain their maximum development. Many spe-
cies abound in the Oolitic or Jurassic formation: in the Greensand they are likewise abundant; in the Gal? there
are but two or three 8mall species.
