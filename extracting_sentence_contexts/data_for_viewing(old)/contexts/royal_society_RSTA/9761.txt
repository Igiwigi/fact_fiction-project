the most convenient mercury lamp that has yet been devised and it is a matter for
regret that it is no longer manufactured commercially.

(c) A vertical “ Quartzlite” lamp, both made of silica and taking a current of 3°5
amperes. These lamps were specially constructed for use with the polarimeter and
have been described and figured in the ‘Trans. Faraday Soce.,’ 1912, vol. 7, 267.

(4) (a) Mercury Green. Hg 5460°97.

In reading rotations of large magnitude it is impossible to use sodium light as a
standard, owing to the fact that the lines D, and D, are not extinguished together,
the difference amounting in the experiments now described to 8° for the dextro-quartz
and 11° for the levo-quartz column. It was, therefore, necessary to adopt some other
light for the purpose of making stringent tests on the quartz blocks before attempting
measurements of rotatory dispersion. For this purpose the green mercury line was
selected. The choice has been fully justified by practical experience during several
subsequent years. Not only is the line one of the easiest to produce and read but it
is the only line of the 24 which can be read as easily and as sharply to 0°01 ona
rotation of 12,000° as on one of 5°. Most of the measurements were made with the
glass Bastian lamp as a source of light, a dense prism on the constant-deviation spectro-
scope and a dense direct-vision prism on the eye-piece. Although the line can be
resolved on the echelon spectroscope, its spectral purity is incomparably greater than
that of sodium (Nurrrye, ‘ Bureau of Standards Bulletin,’ 1906 [IL], 249), and it is
