which he endeavoured to refer the chemical action of light to a standard measure.
His first papert contains a description of this instrument. In 1844 he published a
memoir on “ tithonised” chlorine, in which he gives some of his reasons for believing
that the effect of light is to produce an allotropic form of chlorine. This view is
further dealt with in a paper published in 1845, The allotropic modification is,
according to Draper, more active than chlorine which has not been illuminated, as it
combines readily with hydrogen even in the dark.{ This conclusion was contradicted
by Buysen and Roscor,$ who exposed the gases evolved by the electrolysis of
hydrochloric acid separately to sunlight, and led them then into their “insolation”
vessel, On exposing the mixture to light, they found no greater difference between
the duration of the induction period of this pre-illuminated mixture and that of gases
which had not been previously illuminated than is to be accounted for by unavoidable
errors of experiment.|| This contradiction is explained by the fact that, in Draper's
experiment, the gases were mixed in the vessel where they were submitted to the
