The tendency to turn the lever in a direction opposed to the arrow is therefore pre-
dominant ; the lever will obey this tendency and move until the needle finds itself in
the magnetic meridian : when this position is attained, the predominance spoken of
evidently ceases, and the system will be in equilibrium. Experiment perfectly cor-
roborates this theoretic deduction.

In this case, the centre of gravity of the needle recedes from the north magnetic
pole as if it were repelled by the latter; but it is evident that the recession is not due
either to the attraction or repulsion of the needle considered as a whole, but simply
to the mechanical advantage possessed by the force @', on account of its greater
distance from the axis of rotation. If the force acting upon every particle of the
needle were purely attractive, it is eyident that no such recession could take place.
Supposing, then, that we were simply acquainted with the fact, that the end F of the
needle is attracted by the terrestrial pole, and that we were wholly ignorant of the
action of the said pole upon the end h, the experiment here described would lead us
infallibly to the conclusion that the end 4 must be repelled. For if it were attracted,
or even if it were neither attracted nor repelled, the motion of the bar must be towards
the pole N instead of in the opposite direction.

Let us apply this reasoning to the experiment with the bismuth prisms already
described. The motion of the magnetic needle in the case referred to is not more
inexplicable, on the assumption of a purely attractive force, than is the motion of our
rectangular box on the assumption of a purely repulsive one; and if the above expe-
riment would lead to the conclusion that the end Ã¾ of the magnetic needle is repelled,
the experiment with the bismuth leads equally to the conelusion that the end F of the
