In the early work on extended
thermodynamics, the fluxes of conserved quantities have been chosen as additional variables,
and also fluxes of fluxes and even higher fluxes. Over time, two schools have emerged (see the
article by Jou in this theme issue), nowadays known as rational extended thermodynamics (RET)
[9] and extended irreversible thermodynamics (EIT) [10]. The restriction to the conserved quantities and fluxes appearing in balance equations as
variables is motivated by the fact that their convection behaviour is well-understood so that
one can focus entirely on the irreversible processes, which are usually associated with entropy
production. Convection conserves entropy, and guaranteeing the non-negativity of entropy
production by irreversible processes is a central element of any framework of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. The use of more general structural variables became possible by the generalization of
convection in terms of Hamiltonian dynamics with degenerate Poisson brackets.
