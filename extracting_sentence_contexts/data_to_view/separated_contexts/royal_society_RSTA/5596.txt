As explained in [71], starting from the ansatz (3.17) (and a similar one py+1(x,t)=
P(ug(x, #), Ra(%, #), Ag41%,Ag+41)), it is possible to write down a family of ‘ideal’ conditions that W
would have to satisfy so to give a ‘clean’ iteration leading to a proof of theorem 3.5(b). These
conditions are

— &+>+ Wv,R,&,7) is 21-periodic with vanishing average, i.e.

1
W) := ——z | Wi, R, dé =0; 1
W) on | (v,R,&,1) dg =0; (18)
— The average stress is given by R, i.e.
(W@W)=R. (3.19)
— Wand P satisfy
drW +0- VeW + dive(W @ W) + VeP =0
(3.20)
and diveW =0. Assuming a W as above exists and it is smooth in all variables,” the best we can hope for, in
view of (3.19) are bounds of the form

IWISIRE?, |aWISIRI?,  laRWI SIRI. (3.21)

'Note that this is no serious restriction, as any triple (v,p, R) can be easily smoothed to a new triple still solving (3.3): in fact
there are several ways of doing this, given that the system is very much underdetermined.

2In reality this family of conditions is somewhat naive and there is no such W which would satisfy the bound (3.21). The main
issue is in the advective part 3, v, + v - VeW of equation (3.20). While it is not possible to accommodate (3.20) exactly, the main
idea around the problem is that the condition does not need to be fulfilled ‘exactly’, but we can allow for a suitable error.
