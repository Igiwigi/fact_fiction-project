The proposal presented here admits many variations, including the various interesting DS

possibilities discussed in Kent [2] (adapted to allow for the new treatment here of outcome data, .
distinguishing data from inside and outside the future lightcone). Intriguingly, it also suggests
natural ways to generalize quantum theory, following [2,12,13]. For, given a beable formulation—
a description of quantum reality—consistent with standard quantum dynamics, we can define
modified theories by altering the rules for assigning probabilities to beable configurations. For
example, we can introduce weight factors that depend directly on the beable configuration,
and use these to rescale the probabilities for beable configurations that are defined by standard
quantum theory. Even more general possibilities are also available.

More extended comments and discussions of possibilities in these directions, which apply—
and indeed, apply with more force—to the present proposal can be found in [2]. The fact that our
beables take the form of a generalized stress-energy tensor also suggests a possible new path to
considering the coupling of quantum theory and gravity, while avoiding the problems afflicting
standard semi-classical gravity [2].
