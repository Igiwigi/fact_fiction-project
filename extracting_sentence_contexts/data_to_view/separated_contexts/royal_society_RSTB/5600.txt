It may be recalled
that these experiments subjecting the fish to a rise of temperature in the laboratory
were paralleled by transferring the fish from the river to a shallow stream at a tem-
perature 4°-5° C. higher than the river, and here the fish also developed the secondary
sexual characters rapidly. The Operation Experiments 32, 33, etc., show that the removal of the testis, prior
to the temperature change, does not affect the development of the secondary sexual
characters. This is clearly due to the fact that the testes of these fish contained well-
developed interstitial tissue when they were totally castrated. Other experiments
show that if the fish is totally castrated with the interstitial tissue undeveloped, there
is no appearance of the secondary sexual characters if the fish is subjected to a suitable
temperature rise. The secretion of the interstitial tissue has therefore been produced
and is available after the removal of the testes of the fish.
