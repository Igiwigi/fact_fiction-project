observations, taken together with the data derived from the cooling-curves described
above, is that the limiting solubility of tin in lead at a temperature of about 180° C.
(which is near the temperature of the freezing of the eutectic, and therefore very close
to the solidus in alloys containing nearly 16 per cent. of tin) is very little more than
16 per cent. On this view an alloy containing a little less than 16 per cent. of tin,
if cooled so slowly that complete equilibrium is attained, would solidify as a
homogeneous mass, no eutectic being separated. It will be seen, however, that there
is good reason to suppose that some “secondary” tin is separated from this solid

solution at lower temperatures if the alloy is slowly cooled, and this fact has
considerably complicated the determination of the limiting solubility. The fact that
very gradual cooling would be required to produce this complete equilibrium is borne
out by microscopic evidence, as well as by the cooling-curves described above.
Figs. 23 and 24 (Plate 6) are photo-micrographs, at a magnification of 150 diameters,
of alloys containing 10 and 15 per cent. of tin respectively, cooled from fusion in
an ordinary laboratory furnace. Considerable quantities of eutectic appear in both,
but, as has already been indicated, these alloys gradually become homogeneous on
exposure to a temperature of 175° C.

In the alloys lying between 8 and approximately 60 per cent. of tin the cooling-
curves show the existence of changes involving an evolution of heat at a temperature
which lies at 149° C. for alloys above 18 per cent. of tin, and at lower temperatures
