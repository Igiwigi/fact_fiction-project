12. Remarks on the Disturbance-variations â€”At nearly all stations whose disturbance-
dinrnal variation curves have been found by the process described above, one or other
of these curves, either the easterly or the westerly, closely corresponds in shape to a
general type. The westerly disturbance- diurnal variation curve for Bombay conforms
to this type, of which the characteristics are, that during about half the day the ordi-
nates are yery 8mall, whilst there is a gradual and regular rise on either side of this
quiescent period towards a maximum, which occurs near the middle of the remaining

* The deficiency in the ratios and numbers of observations for the year 1861 is partly accounted for by the
fact that during an aggregate of thirty-one days in the months of Tuly, August, October, and November the
instrument was acting irregularly or was under adjustment, and the observations had to be rejected.

part of the day; such curves are the easterly for Kew, St. Helena, Toronto, and the
Cape of Good Hope, and the westerly for Hobarton, St. Helena, Pekin, and Nertschinsk.
'The correspondence as to shape does not, however, hold as to time, either absolute or
local, for the hours of maxima are not confined to any particular portion of the day.
The Bombay astronomical hours of little or no westerly disturbance are from 6 to 17,
the considerable and regular variation from hour to hour occurring during the remaining
hours. The principal features of the easterly disturbance- diurnal variation curve for
