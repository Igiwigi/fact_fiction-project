tains during the transit a little superiority with respect to that kind which it
first received from the pole, and is, by virtue of that difference, carried forward
through the fluid to the opposite pole {.

488. This theory implies that decomposition takes place at both poles upon
distinct portions of fluid, and not at all in the intervening parts. The latter
serve merely as imperfect conductors, which, assuming an electric state, urge
particles electrified more highly at the poles through them in opposite direc-
tions, by virtue of a series of ordinary electrical attractions and repulsions\.

489. M. A. ps 14 Rivs investigated this subject particularly, and published
a paper on it in 1825]. He thinks those who have referred the phenomena to
the attractive powers of the poles, express the fact generally, rather than give
any explication of it. He considers the results as due to an actual combina-
tion of the elements, or rather of half of them, with the electricities passing
from the poles in consequence of a kind of play of affinities between the matter
and electricity {[. The current from the positive pole combining with the
hydrogen, or the bases it finds there, leayes the oxygen and acids at liberty,
but carries the substances it is united with across to the negative pole, where,
because of the peculiar character of the metal as a conductor##, it is separated
from them, entering the metal, and leaving the hydrogen or bases upon its
surface, In the same manner the electricity from the negative pole sets the
