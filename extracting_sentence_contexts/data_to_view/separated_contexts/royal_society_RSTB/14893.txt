Perceptual response fractions (a—c) and perceptual confidence (df) for auditory B/P, visual G/K and McGurk stimuli. (a) Response fractions over ‘B/P’, ‘D/
T and G/K’ percepts (top) and associated perceptual confidence (bottom) separately for auditory B/P stimulus (a,d), visual G/K stimulus (b,e) and McGurk stimulus
(ie. auditory B/P and visual G/K; (cf)). In all figure components, bar plots show across subjects’ means and box plots indicate across subjects’ median response
fraction with first and third quartiles and with whiskers indicating the minimum and maximum subject values. (Online version in colour.)

Moreover, because the variance of the posterior distribution performance. This metacognitive insensitivity arises from the
of the audiovisual distribution is smaller or equal to that of fact that the six response options are spanned by the place of
either unisensory posterior distribution, we would expect articulation (e.g. B versus D versus G) and the voicing (i.e. B
participants to be more confident on audiovisual congruent versus P) dimensions.
