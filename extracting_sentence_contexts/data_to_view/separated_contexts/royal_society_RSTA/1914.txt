Now the lines of the
Rempstone and Sileby Faults would intersect at a point in the Wreak Valley just
south-east of Asfordby Village, and about two miles west of Melton Mowbray. It
is precisely at this assumed intersection-point of the two faults that the main
magnetic disturbing centre is situated, as indicated by the intersection of the arrows
showing the “relative” horizontal disturbing forces at Melton and Asfordby respec-
tively (see p. 82). That all four lines should intersect at one and the same point cannot be an
accidental coincidence, especially when account is taken of the fact that the Lough-
borough and Rempstone disturbing forces also intersect on the fault-line. * It affords
a strong presumption that the magnetic disturbances may originate in connexion
with the fault, and that magnetic material is concentrated at particular localities
along the fault-line.
