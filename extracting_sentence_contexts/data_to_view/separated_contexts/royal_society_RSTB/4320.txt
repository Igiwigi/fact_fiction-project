between actual branched pancreatic tissue. It is true that
the branched pancreatic tissue encircling the left aspect of the portal vein is derived
from the original dorsal pancreatic duct, but its duct-like structure has entirely
disappeared by the time that fusion occurs between it and the two ventral primordia. In dealing with the origin and fate of the dorsal pancreatic duct (ante, p. 315),
attention was called to the fact that the duct exhibits a remarkable variability. inasmuch as it may either persist until late in foetal life or undergo complete
degeneration at a much earlier stage. The duct, when persistent, opens inde-
pendently into the left dorso-lateral border of the duodenum, removed some little
distance from the common bile duct opening.
