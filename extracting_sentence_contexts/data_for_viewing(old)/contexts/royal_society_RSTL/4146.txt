position of water by heat would be; the effect of platinum, like that of heat, on the
elements of water having been hitherto known only as combining them. With regard
to any theoretic views I may have advanced, I by no means attach the same import-
ance to them as I do to the facts themselves, though I consider it necessary for the
collation of facts, and desirable for the progress of science, that an author pretending
to communicate new results should give with them the impressions which led to their
discovery, and the inferences which he regards as immediately deducible from them.
No expression can be given to facts which does not involve some theory, and ad-
mitting the difficulty (perbaps insuperable) of correctly enunciating new phenomena,
and the probability of future discoveries entirely changing our views regarding them,
I cannot at present see that the title of my paper could be altered without being
open to greater objections. I am of this opinion, not s0 much because other bodies
than platinum will produce the effect, as I shall presently show, nor from the fact
that the electrical spark will decompose aqueous vapour, though these are arguments
in its favour; but from the following considerations. The catalytic action of plati-
num will induce or enable combination to take place where there is already a strong
affinity or tendency to combine, as with mixed oxygen and hydrogen gases ; it will
also induce decomposition where the affinities are extremely weak, or in a state of
unstable equilibrium, as in Txzxanp's peroxide of bydrogen ; again, where there are
