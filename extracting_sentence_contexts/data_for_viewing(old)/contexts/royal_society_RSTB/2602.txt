SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARTIAN TYPES OF CORALS. 165

genus Jsastrwa, beginning this time with the typical massive form of the Jsastrea
corallum, in which calyces were clearly walled off from each other, and ending with a
typical Latimeandrea, in which few calyces have their own walls, most being arranged
in confluent series, irregularly walled and winding. The individuality of the polyp is
never so great in Jsastrea as in Thecosmilia, since the Thecosmilian polyp at the end
of a free stem carries on a much more independent existence than an Isastrean polyp
on the surface of a compact colony. Again, although Thecosmilia may also have a
massive corallum, the dignity of the polyp never descends so far as in that of a
typical Latimeandroid. And we shall generally find that there is a certain standard
of independence for each genus, which may be taken as a measure of the genus in
placing it systematically. We may, in fact, use the form of the corallum and its
habit of increase as a generic feature when we keep in view the highest degree of
polypal individuality attained and the lowest. No sooner do we keep both ends of
the scale before us than “ gemmation” and “ fissiparity” merge in one another.
“ Fissiparity” I take to be simply a hastened development of buds under certain con-
ditions and at certain periods of “ vegetative growth” in the life of the coral. And
the buds, which form long meandroid series and never develop fully, probably perform
in an Astraid colony the functions of a coenenchymal area in “ Perforates,” namely,
the rapid circulation of nutritive material throughout the colony.

GEMMATION AND FissipARiry.

As I have already said (antea, p. 147), all the forms of budding may be reduced to
