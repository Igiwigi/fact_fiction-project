Corollary.—The associated oscillation function, being the sum of two upper semi-
continuous functions,t is itself an upper semi-continuous function. Theorem 9.—If S’ be a component of the fundamental set 8, such that all the
limiting points of S! which belong to S are contained in 8’, then the wpper (lower) limit
of a function in (S—S’) is the same as that of the associated upper (lower) limiting
function in (S—8’). This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at any point P of (S—S’)
is unaffected by the values of the function at the points of 8’, since P is not a limiting
point of 8’. Whence the result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a point of an upper (lower) semi-continuous function is
the maximum (minimum) at that point in the case of such a function, enables us to
substitute the word value instead of maximum (minimum) in the definition of
integration.
