The heat conveyed by the stream of gas is proportional to
the volume of the gas in motion, its mean rise of temperature, its mean velocity,
Bits specific heat, and its density ; thus we have for a given temperaturet

a Convection = A go i

ew here A = a constant, p = the density of the gas, C = the specific heat, y = the
‘Bviscosity.

4 According to the above formula, the relative convection in carbon dioxide, oxygen,
Suir, and hydrogen is represented by the numbers 20, 8°6, 8°5, and 1:2. If we take
Zinto consideration that the experimental numbers 0:000020, 0°000013, 0°000009, and
#0-00001 are obtained from the difference of two nearly equal quantities, the agree-
Ement may be considered satisfactory.

& Weare now in a position to express in absolute units the heat lost respectively

8by convection, conduction, and radiation. S

* his fact is confirmed by the experiments of Kunpt and Warburc (see ‘ Pogg. Ann.,’ vol. 156, p. 179,
1875). They found that, in a certain apparatus, the heat dissipated was independent of pressure up to
30 millims. in the case of air, and up to 154 millims in the case of hydrogen.

+ This relation between the heat lost by convection and the density, viscosity, and specific heat of a gas
only holds good when the speed of the convection currents is very low; at higher temperature and
pressures the phenomenon is more complex.
