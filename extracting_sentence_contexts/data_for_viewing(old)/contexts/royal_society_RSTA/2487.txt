Wind; but also MESSENGER [76], INTEGRAL and Rosetta [83], combined with the state-of-the-
art modelling and ground-based measurements at Earth and/or Mars [84], all of which have
provided new insights into the spatial distributions of SEP events.

2. Solar energetic particle events short- and long-term forecasting

High-energy particles both from the Sun and from outside the heliosphere (i.e. galactic cosmic
rays) are a radiation hazard [85]. It is important to be able to predict the additional fluxes driven
by solar eruptive events that are superimposed on the ever present cosmic ray background [86].
As stated in ยง1, the majority of SEPs are protons which reach energies up to the GeV range (i.e.
GLEs) only on occasion. Thereby, although all GLEs are accompanied by major SEP events at
lower energy, a considerable number of SEP events which can lead to a serious radiation risk are
not accompanied by a GLE [87]. This highlights the fact that in the future an integration of the
available forecasting tools from low-energy SEPs to relativistic GLEs should be made possible.
Moreover, multi-spacecraft observations of SEPs, combined with the growing need for human
exploration in space,> gave ground to efforts for the accurate quantification and prediction of the
radiation environment in other planets (e.g. Mars) [84], and within the IP space, in general [88]. In
order to be able to achieve an early warning and to take mitigating actions against solar radiation
storms, two basic questions should be addressed:

(i) Will a solar eruptive event lead to an SEP event on the Earth or elsewhere in the
heliosphere?

(ii) Which characteristics of the parent solar event(s) can be used for the prediction of the
properties of the SEP event in specific locations?
