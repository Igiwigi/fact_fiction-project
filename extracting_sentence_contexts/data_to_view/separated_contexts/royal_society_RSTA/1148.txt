Assuming that w(T) > —00, N(w) blows
up as w > @(T). If there are C, k > 0 such that N(w) < C(w — o(T))~* for w — o(T) >0 sufficiently
small, then, as shown in [42], one gets sup; tk eM T(£)|| < 00. In fact, one may associate
with every blow-up rate of the resolvent an appropriate correction of exponential growth of the
semigroup; see [24] for details. Recently, using the techniques of [42], the following interesting
result was proved by Wei in [43, Theorem 1.3]. Theorem 2.4.
