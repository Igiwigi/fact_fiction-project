For example, sometimes we want to understand what is being explained (plural is explananda).

â€œTopological explanations raise ontological questions about math-
ematical objects. Philosophers of mathematics cast this in terms of
the so-called indispensability arguments, according to which we

case of homophily, where regions with similar connectivity
