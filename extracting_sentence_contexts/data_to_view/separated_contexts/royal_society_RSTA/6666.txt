But in none of the papers on this type of discharge is a frequency less
thana megacycle quoted, and itseems likely that the frequency used here is too low to produce
such an effect. This experiment thus leads to the conclusion that no appreciable amount of
ionization is caused by the ‘electrostatic’ field. This is confirmed by the fact that the break-
down potentials were the same when a narrow feed-point gap was used. After breakdown the highly ionized gas will be similar to a metallic conductor, and the
magnitude of the field in the gas will depend on the capacitative coupling between the copper
coating and the gas. A simple calculation shows that this capacity is of the order of 260 pF
and its impedance to 150 kc./sec. is 4000 ohms.
