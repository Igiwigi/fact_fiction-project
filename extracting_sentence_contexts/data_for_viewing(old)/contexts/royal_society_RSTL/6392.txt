$ 10. On the Physical Connexion of Radiation, Absorption, and Conduction.

Notwithstanding the great accessions of late years to our knowledge of the nature of
heat, we are as yet, I believe, quite ignorant of the atomic conditions on which radia-
tion, absorption, and conduction depend. What are the specific qualities which cause
one body to radiate copiously and another feebly? Why, on theoretic grounds, must
the equivalence of radiation and absorption exist? Why should a highly diatherma-
nous body, as shown by Mr. BairouR STEWART, be a bad radiator, and an adiatherma-
nous body a good radiator ? How is heat conducted ? and what is the strict physical
meaning of good conduction and bad conduction? Why should good conductors be,
in general, bad radiators, and bad conductors good radiators ? 'These, and other questions,
referring to facts more or less established, have still to receive their complete answers.
It is less with a hope of furnishing such than of shadowing forth the possibility of
uniting these various effects by a common bond, that I submit the following reflections
to the notice of the Royal Society.

In the experiments recorded in the foregoing pages, we have dealt with free atoms,
both simple and compound, and it has been found that in all cases absorption takes
place. The meaning of this, according to the dynamical theory of heat, is that no atom
is capable of existing in vibrating ether without accepting a portion of its motion. We
may, if we wish, imagine a certain roughness of the surface of the atoms which enables
the ether to bite them and carry the atom along with it. But no matter what the
quality may be which enables any atom to accept motion from the agitated ether, the
8ame quality must enable it to impart motion to still ether when it is plunged in the
