The apparent change here observed is of the order of about 1 in 32,000,000 parts.
We now proceed to review, very briefly, the results yielded by the two series of experi-
ments, and to indicate the probable causes and sources of the observed variations.

(6) Of the Possible Errors associated with the Experiments of Series I. and IT.—
In itself, and from a certain point of view, the final result secured by means of the
experiments of Series II. was both excellent and gratifying. We may not, however,
ignore the important fact, that this result is not in harmony with the final result
obtained from Series I. As the two sets of measurements were effected under precisely
similar conditions, the two final values are, so far as can be known, equally reliable.
If we combine the two final values, then the apparent change in mass is equal to

$('033—"004) = ‘015 mgr.

Or, the apparent change in the whole weighed mass is equal to 1 in 8°5 million
parts ; this degree of accuracy was frequently attained by Lanporr and by him
sometimes surpassed.

Tn our opinion it was now definitely established that the observed apparent changes
in mass arise, not from any appreciable inherent or unallowed-for defects in the
