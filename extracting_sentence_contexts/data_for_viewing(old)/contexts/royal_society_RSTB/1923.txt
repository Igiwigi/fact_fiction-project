indirectly with the accessory auditory ganglion; while the fibres of the central
auditory tract either help to form, or lie in association with, the lateral fillet.

A continuation of some of the fibres of the lateral fillet beyond the posterior quad-
rigeminal body has been described both by Kénimer and Hexp, but the latter's
statement that fibres can be traced through the quadrigeminal region, the regio-sub-
thalamica, and the internal capsule to the cortex of the temporal lobe, so as to form a
“direct cortical auditory tract,’ has not been confirmed by Kéxurker (vol. 2,
p. 896).

The probable existence of a strand of fibres passing from the internal geniculate
body to the superior temporal convolution has been stated by numerous observers ;
while the fact that it medullates at a definite period of intra-uterine life has been
recently established by Fiecusie (88). This radiation of the internal geniculate body

* Vow Monaxow’s (22) observation that section of the lateral fillet produced atrophy of the strim
acustice and of the tuberculum acusticum, without any alteration in the trapezoid body, does not
militate against the observations here recorded.

ascends through the optic thalamus, and crosses the posterior part of the internal
capsule and the putamen, to end in the superior temporal gyrus. This tract corre-
sponds with the “direct cortical auditory tract ” of HELD. :
