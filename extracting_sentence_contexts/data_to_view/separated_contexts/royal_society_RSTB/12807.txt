In the present case, the stable isotopic results results in order to avoid false positives [70] (table 1). However,

taking into consideration from the MALT results that 99% of all
Mycobacterium genus DNA reads found in the calculus were
exclusively of M. leprae origin rather than a different myco-
bacterium, we conclude that the remaining protein is in fact
from M. leprae as well.

content comparison in dentine and calculus

Endogenous human DNA found within the dentine and
the calculus followed a similar deamination pattern to that
previously observed by Mann eft al. [71]. In particular, the den-
tine sample had significantly higher deamination rates even
when normalizing the number of reads. By contrast, M. leprae
DNA deamination rates were similar regardless of source
material (electronic supplementary material, tables S2 and S6).
