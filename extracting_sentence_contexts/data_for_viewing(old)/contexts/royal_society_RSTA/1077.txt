of spectral features (such as feature C/C’ in figure 3) complicates their assignment rendering
the extraction of unambiguous information difficult. The shape resonances (D/D’ in figure 3)
were proposed to arise from scattering of the metal 1s electron from surrounding atoms. This
is based on the seminal work by Farrel Lytle and co-workers [54] (after whom the ‘Farrel W.
Lytle Award’ of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) facility at the SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory in Stanford is named). Following this work, a rule now known


as Natoli’s rule was proposed [55]. According to this, the energy shift of the shape resonance can
be used to estimate changes in distances between the probed metal and its nearest neighbours
because the energy of the shape resonance can be thought to approximately depend on the
nearest-neighbour distances R by 1/R. Concerns about limitations of this rule have been raised
repeatedly [53,56] and they all relate to the complications arising from the fact that both geometric
and electronic structure effects considerably influence energies and intensities of the transitions
in the transition-metal K-edge XAS spectra.

There are several ways to probe the electronic structure of 3d transition-metal complexes more
directly and one is to analyse the pre-edge features in K-edge XAS spectra located at energies
below the edge (they are seen at approx. 7110 eV in figure 1 and labelled P in figure 3). These are
due to 1s > 3d transitions [45,57] and they give direct access to the 3d-derived frontier orbitals.
Because these transitions are dipole forbidden they are much weaker than the transitions in or
above the edge and this has largely hampered their utilization so far in time-resolved K-edge
XAS studies of transition-metal complexes and metalloproteins at XFELs (with first indications of

the usefulness by Chen’s group [49] and in a study by Lemke et al. [58] as well as in exemplary : =
