All
the values in the table are consistent and show quite definitely the separate influence
of moon and cloud ; but the most remarkable difference from the Noctuid table is
the very high value obtained on the nights of no‘moon with cloud, which is almost
three times the value of any of the adjoining groups and nearly six times the number
of the opposite extreme “‘ full moon, no cloud”’. TasLe XIII

Another curious fact is the small difference between the values for full moon
and no moon on nights when there is no cloud. If one were to attempt an explanation of the differences at the present early stage
in the investigation it might be suggested that the insects as a whole (which include
avery large majority of small Diptera) are more sensitive to “optimum”? conditions,
which are cloudy (and hence warm and damp) nights with no moon, and do not
fly if these conditions are not existing, while the Noctuidae are more tolerant of their
climatic environment and are only seriously reduced by the poorest conditions,
which are cool clear nights with full moon.
