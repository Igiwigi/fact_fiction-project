It is necessary to determine whether a unique value of 7 exists through the
photographs of one particular line, permitting the equations of the contours to take
this form, in order to decide whether the line has one or more components. 4H, is a
suitable medium for this determination, and a succeeding section takes up this
question.

(VL) The Effect of Dispersion.

When the photographs are magnified on a large scale they all appear unsym-
metrically broadened towards the violet. This is the effect to be expected from the
fact that the spectrum produced by the prism is not normal, and it is necessary, before
a detailed analysis of the photographs can be made, to calculate the asymmetry due
to this cause and to compare it with the actual effect observed. A complete account
of this problem is given below in connection with the best magnified photograph
obtained for H,. The dispersion on the original plate, before magnification, was
known to be given very accurately by the formula

A =A/+t+C/(n+n))

where A, = 2257°5, C = 116,802°9, d is in A.U., and n+ is in millimetres of the scale.
The scale reading for the centre of the pattern of Ha, \ = 6563, is, therefore, on the

original plate
