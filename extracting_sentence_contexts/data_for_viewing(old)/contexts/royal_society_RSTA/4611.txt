‘characteristic earthquakes’ recur more or less regularly, a renewal process is assumed and the
time-dependent probabilities are calculated from the average recurrence interval and date of the
most recent event. The term ‘characteristic earthquake’ was originally defined for a repeating
earthquake with similar slip distribution [7], but it has been used more broadly allowing some
variability. The ERC adopted the Brownian Passage Time (BPT) model [8], among several
probability density function models, to calculate the 30-year probability. If data indicate that
temporal distribution of earthquake occurrence is random, or if available data are insufficient
to indicate regular recurrence, the Poisson process, in which earthquakes are assumed to occur
randomly, is adopted to calculate the time-independent probability. As of 2010, the highest 30-year
probability in Japan, 99%, was calculated for a large earthquake with M ~ 7.5 in the Miyagi-oki
region, just west of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake source. However, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake
(M 9.0) was much larger than the long-term forecast. As detailed in the following sections, this
underestimation is due to the fact that the government's long-term forecast was based ona simple
‘characteristic earthquake’ model with seismological and historical data of past earthquakes in the
last few centuries.
