The number of rows, however, contained in the tube seemed four: which
of conrse would become connected in the above way, as easily as two; and give
origin to a corresponding number of interlacing spirals.

25. I cannot suppose that minuteness is any hindrance to the smallest filament
(* fibre”) having its origin by the same mode: and to this, the linear arrangement of
the discs within the blood-corpuscle seems to have especial reference}. Facts will be
hereafter mentioned, which seem to show a fasciculus of filaments to be thus produced
in a certain tis8ue (par. 42—44).

26. Within the windings of the spirals (fig. 57 «), nuclei are sometimes to be dis-
cerned. It appears to be from these nuclei that there proceeds the substance for
forming new filaments (fig. 22); which are very often seen within the winds of spirals
(figs. 131 Þ, 94, 58).
