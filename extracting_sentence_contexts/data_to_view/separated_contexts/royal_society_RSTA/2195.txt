The two main results are that the progression of all
the morphological and optical properties of the crystals, with the atomic weight of the
alkali metal (K = 38°85, Rb = 84°9, Cs = 131°9, and Rb—K = 46, Cs—Rb = 47), is
beautifully shown once more in this nickel group of double selenates ; and that the
true isomorphism, but not eutropism, of the ammonium salt with the potassium,
rubidium and cesium salts is clearly indicated by the principal determinative constants
(such as interfacial angles, size of the unit cell of the space-lattice, refractive indices
and molecular refraction) of the ammonium salt never falling outside the limits of
these constants for the two extreme, potassium and cesium, salts of the group. 8 The former of these two main results is admirably illustrated by the fact that both

Sthe average and the maximum amounts of interfacial angular change, brought about

Bby replacing one alkali metal by another, are directly proportional to the change in

atomic weight. The differences of atomic weight between potassium and rubidium

Sand between the latter and cesium are practically the same (46 and 47), and the

Bchanges in angle, whether the mean of all the changes of the 36 angles measured or

sathe greatest change of angle observed, are also equal ; or to express it differently, the

‘replacement of K by Cs is accompanied by twice as much angular change as that of

7K by Rb (average changes K by Rb, 23’, and K by Cs, 47’, maxima 57’ and 119’),

Ejust as the change of atomic weight Cs—K (= 93) is double that for Rb—K (= 46).

Z which, on a generous estimate, cannot exceed 3’,
