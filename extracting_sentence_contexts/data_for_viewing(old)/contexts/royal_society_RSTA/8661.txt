potentials fall short of what are required to produce lightning discharges, there is no
reason to suppose that the vertical currents are of an altogether different order of
magnitude. If any considerable proportion of shower-clouds are of positive polarity
the upper atmosphere will receive an excess of positive electricity which may possibly
be sufficient to maintain the positive potential of the conducting layers and to supply
the normal downward current of the fine-weather regions. The total current which
must be supplied for this purpose is, as Smrpson* has pointed out, of the order of
1000 amp√©res for the whole earth.

It is not necessary to suppose that only isolated clouds of the cumulo-nimbus type
contribute to the current between the ground and the upper atmosphere. If we
consider a cloud from which heavy rain is falling and assume that the conditions are
uniform over a large area, the case is in fact somewhat simpler than that of the
cumulo-nimbus cloud ; the general results are the same.

We may suppose that a steady condition is reached in which the vertical electric
field within the cloud (and thus the potential difference between its upper and lower
surfaces) has a value which depends on the rate of rainfall and other factors; it is
assumed to be independent of the sign of the polarity. Even if this potential
difference is only yy or yo of that reached in thunder-clouds the effects may be
important: the E.M.F. which tends to drive a current between the ground and the
upper atmosphere is still from 10 to 100 times the normal potential of the upper
atmosphere above fine-weather regions.
