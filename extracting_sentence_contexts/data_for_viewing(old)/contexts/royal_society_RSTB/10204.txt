teported here are based on the estimated growth rate (2) for a particular
strain and condition.

eight different genotypes, which we call ‘strains’, of
the trypanosomatid C. bombi. We did not test the fourth
AMP, Apidaecin, that is present in bumblebees for various
technical reasons. We chose to use in vitro assays, as one advan-
tage of this system is that C. bombi can be cloned and kept in
culture, i.e. as strains. This eliminates the confounding effects
of host background, which leads to substantial variation
for the outcome depending on which strain (genotype) of
C. bombi infects which host genetic background [44,45]. In
fact, the expression of these AMPs depends on the host genetic
background [16,46], the strain of the parasite [17] and the
interaction of the two [47].

2. Material and methods

(a) Bumblebees and parasites

Queens of the bumblebee, B. terrestris, were captured in spring
2008 and 2010 in Aesch and Neunform (Northern Switzerland)
and kept in the laboratory at 26°C under constant red light.
The faeces of naturally infected queens were collected and
single C. bombi cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell
