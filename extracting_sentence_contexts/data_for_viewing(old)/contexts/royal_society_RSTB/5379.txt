Calne does not come within the province of this paper, but this list of Echinoderms
is inserted in order to show that, palwontologically as well as lithologically, it is partially
isolated from our district. It is difficult to account for these facts, except by connecting
them with the analogous change which is observed in the Berkshire Oolites, and to
attribute the whole to the effects of the uplift of the Purton anticline. We find final
confirmation of these conclusions in a study of the Upper Caleareous Grit.

(ce) The Littlemore Clay Beds.â€”It is well known that at Littlemore near Oxford, and
at Hilmarton, Wiltshire, the Lower Calcareous Grit is succeeded by Corallian Clays.
These clays raise such interesting points that it is considered desirable to treat of them
in a separate subsection, together with similar beds which, it is less generally known,
occur at two intervening places. The beds consist of alternate bands of blue-grey clay
and nodular, white-weathering, argillaceous limestone or mudstone, in layers a few inches
in thickness. The areas where they occur are very limited in extent, and pass through
to the inner or shore side of the reef. With regard to their age, it can be seen that these
