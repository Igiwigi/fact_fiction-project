Submarine landslide tsunamis, however, were not fully recognized
prior to the 1998 Papua New Guinea (PNG) event [5]. This was despite clear tsunami evidence
from events such as the 1929 Grand Banks tsunami [6,7], the 1979 Nice tsunami [8], as well as
the 8150 BP Storegga landslide tsunami [9,10]. In fact, the PNG event gave rise to a scientific
dispute, eventually leading to a general acceptance that the tsunami was due to a slump source
[11,12]. Past investigations may consequently not fully recognize submarine landslides as possible
triggers, and particularly older historical records are therefore likely to be biased [3]. Tsunamis induced by landslides display a greater variety depending on their origin compared
with earthquakes.
