he found brought out the stylet track very distinctly in relation to the cells. As a result
of this reaction he suggests the probability that pectic substances form a part of the

sheath substance in A. rwmicis, as PETRI says they do in the case of Phylloxera quoted
above (p. 44).

With Dreyfusia niisslini I also employed the methylene blue stain as used by
Davinson, and obtained good staining of the sheath, but I am unable to deduce from
this fact the presence of pectic substances, for the following reasons :â€”

(a) As a confirmatory test for Pectin and its compounds, I used Ruthenium red,
which is recommended by Motiscn* as one of the best tests for this purpose.
My results showed that although I got good staining of the middle lamelle of
the cell walls, in no case did I detect any sign of staining in the numerous stylet-
sheaths present in the abnormal tissue.

(b) Methylene blue cannot be regarded as a distinctive stain for pectic compounds,
and its action on the sheath may be due either to the presence of some animal
product, perhaps of the nature of mucin, derived from the saliva, or, on the
other hand, to certain plant substances extracted from the cells,
