THE investigation of the erystals of the four salts of the series R,M(SeO,),.6H,0O, in
which M is ferrous iron, and R is potassium, rubidium, csesium, and ammonium, has at
last been successfully and completely accomplished, both morphologically and optically,
and the results are presented in this communication, The difficulties which have
delayed it are described in a separate memoir, read at the same meeting of the Royal
Society and published in the ‘ Proceedings,’* together with details of the manner in
which these difficulties have been overcome.

The main obstacles were (1) the difficulty of preparing ferrous selenate FeSeO,, a
salt very much less stable than ferrous sulphate FeSO,; (2) the ready oxidation of its
solution in water and of the solutions of the double selenates obtained by the addition
of the calculated quantity of the alkali selenate, and (3) the especial difficulty under-
lying the formation of potassium ferrous selenate, and the fact that even when formed
the crystals of this salt decompose and become opaque like porcelain within a very few
hours.

There is no record of rubidium or cesium ferrous selenates having ever been
previously either prepared or investigated, crystallographically or physically.
Ammonium ferrous selenate was prepared by H. Topsgx,t and its goniometry and a
density determination were described by him in his 1870 dissertation ; its optics were
also to a very limited extent described by him in conjunction with C. CHRISTIANSEN,
in their well-known memoir of 1874. Potassium ferrous selenate offered such
insuperable difficulties, however, that Torsok was only able to obtain four approxi-
mate measurements of exterior angles, and no attempt ata density determination
was made; for, as he states in his 1870 dissertation, he found that the crystals which
