Indeed, it is observed that OPVs based on C79 show a reduced tendency
for burn-in loss [11], contrary to the case of Cgo in figure 4a. A simple method to reduce oligomerization and other energy-driven molecular degradation
pathways is to develop architectures that increase the exciton dissociation rate (and hence the
probability of defect formation during its lifetime) without also reducing cell performance. In fact,
bulk [14] and mixed heterojunction [15] cells have precisely this property: by placing a donor-
acceptor interface very near to the point of exciton generation, the exciton almost immediately
dissociates after light absorption, leaving it less time to engage in dissociative molecular
reactions. Indeed, for this same reason, such blended cells also have higher efficienciesâ€”excitons
immediately dissociate into charge carriers prior to recombination. The charge carriers thus

generated are free to travel along contiguous domains of either the donor (in the case of : 8
holes) or acceptor (for electrons) molecules until they are collected at the appropriate device Dos
contacts.
