The fibres are not obliquely placed with reference to the axes of the striz, but. are
almost horizontally oriented. In other words, the deposit is laid down from the first
by the lateral flaps of the septal invagination, and not at the upper edge where the
flaps meet. The absolutely smooth edge of the septum finds in this fact a simple
explanation,

The septa of Huphyllia, therefore, although finely striated on their surfaces, show
two important features of distinction from the septa of types hitherto discussed :—

(1.) Smooth upper edge.

(2.) The fibres are directed almost horizontally outwards from the median plane of
calcification to the opposite surfaces. These correlated features suggest that the septal invagination is not frilled along
