When at rest, however, these forms
frequently exercise little spasmodic jerks or vibrations, tending to partly rotate the
body, but not causing displacement; these are produced by the small accessory
flagellum, I think. Cercomonas.â€”The movements of this form have been described by Wrnyon. * 1
need only draw attention to the fact that, when the flagellates are in the most active
condition, being then pear-shaped or elongated, the undulatory vibration of the body
is produced by the active movement of the attached tail-flagellum. On the other

hand, the forward movement is chiefly caused by the somewhat irregular lashing of
the long anterior flagellum, which often causes the body as a whole to swing sideways
to some extent. This movement is very characteristic.
