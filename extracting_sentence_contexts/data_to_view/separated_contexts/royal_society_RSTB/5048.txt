In the early stages all the spines are formed in exactly the same way as the typical
spines in Eehinus miliaris (GorDoN, 1926, pp. 268-272, figs. 5-7). Later they become
variously modified at their extremities, those on the sternal plates, for example, becoming
spatulate. The majority of the spines in Echinocardium are directed backwards owing
to the fact that the expanded base is much more developed on one side than on the
other (fig. 26, g). In the imago there is a slight indication of this asymmetry (figs. 7
and 16). The fasciolar spines, however, project at right angles to the test, and possess
a symmetrical, but poorly developed, base (fig. 26, f). ‘They remain short, and each of
the six prongs is elaborated at the tip, so that the distal end of the spine becomes
“tufted ” (fig 26, f).
