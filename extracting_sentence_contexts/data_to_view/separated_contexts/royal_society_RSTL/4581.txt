5, 6, c') ;
but 8ubsequently (Plate IV. figs. 7, 8, from an embryo, 24 inches long) this conical
venous channel becomes elongated; its upper part forms the oblique vein already
mentioned, whilst its lower part (s) pursues its course to the right along the auriculo-
ventricular furrow. The coronary vein (g), properly s0 called, is now seen to end,
< not in the right auricle itself, but in this venous channel, falling into its under side at
San acute angle, at a short distance from its termination in the auricle; Still later, in
2a foetus 5 inches long, from vertex to coccyx, the same facts are as plainly obseryed
= (figs. 9, 10) ; and on cutting open the veins at this period, a narrow oblique venous
= channel (0), tapering to a point as it ascends to the left along the back of the auricle,
may be traced from the point of entrance of the true coronary vein (g) upwards to
S the opake streak (7), seen on the wall of the auricle; whilst below the entrance of the
Z coronary vein, the venous channel becomes dilated (s) as it passes to the right, re-
= ceives several cardiac veins, including generally the middle cardiac, and ends in the
Z lower part of the right auricle, close to the interauricular septum, by a somewhat,
.2 contracted orifice, which is guarded by a rudimentary valve.
