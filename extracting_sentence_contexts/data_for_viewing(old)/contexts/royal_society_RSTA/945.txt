the motion or other asymptotic information [3,4] to have the so-called asymptotic completeness,
see [1].

For the unbounded potentials considered here, the question of classical asymptotic
completeness is even more involved. In the case of celestial mechanics, that is (in units where
the gravitational constant equals one), V;;(q) = —mjmj;/|\lq\|, there are collisions for n> 2, and : =
non-collision singularities for n > 4, see [5-7] and §2. Moreover, as shown in [8] for d=1 and 3
n=4 there are initial conditions which (after regularization of binary collisions) do not lead to :
singularities but for which limy—. +00 ||q(t, Xo) ||/t = 00, so that asymptotic velocity (1.3) does not nee)
exist (see also [9]). :

Conversely, for n < 4 celestial bodies asymptotic velocities exist for all initial conditions. This [4
follows from von Zeipel’s theorem and the fact that j*(x) < 00 for n < 3, see theorem 2.6. DN

Remark 1.2 (The constant /). By taking the maximum, we will use the same constant I in (1.2)
and (1.4). To gain more flexibility, by further increasing I, we assume that (1.4) is valid even for
