by the many points of resemblance between this animal and a leech. Mr. HeRBERT
SPENCER has, in his * Principles of Biology,‚Äù placed a gulf between Planarians and
Leeches by denoting the former as secondary, the latter as tertiary aggregates*, It is
obvious, however, that a single leech is directly comparable to a single Bipalium. The
successive pairs of testes, the position of the intromittent generative organs, the septa
of the digestive tract, and, most of all, the pair of posterior czca are evidently homolo-

gous in the two animals. Further, were leeches really tertiary aggregates, the fact
would surely come out in their development, or at least some indication of the mode of
their genesis would survive in the development of some Annelid. Such, however, is not
the case. The young worm or leech is at first unsegmented, like a Planarian ; and the
traces of segmentation appear subsequently in it, just as do the protovertebre in verte-
brates, which Mr. SpexceR calls secondary aggregates. If Mr. SPENCER's hypothesis
were correct, we should expect to find at least s0me Annelid developing its segments in
the egg as a series of buds. It is not, of course, here meant to be concluded that
Annelids are not sometimes in a condition of tertiary aggregation, as Nats certainly is
when in a budding condition, but that ordinarily they are secondary and not tertiary
aggregates; and if 80, then 80 also are Arthropoda.

Much more information concerning the anatomy of Planarians will be required before
