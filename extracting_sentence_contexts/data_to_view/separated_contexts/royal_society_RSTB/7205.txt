The test objects were placed on this, and they were illuminated by an
electric spot-light. They were examined singly and together. It was found that their shapes
could not be recognized, in fact, it was difficult to distinguish them apart. Now there can
be little doubt that diffraction and the aberrations, both of the apparatus and of the eye,
cause the distribution of light on the retina to differ materially from a geometrical image
in the case of each one of these test objects. None the less, material differences in the shapes
of the images should exist.
