by corollary 3.11 we conclude that—for d(t) =0, for all f > 0—the equilibrium point with |67 —
¢| < 2/2 (modulo 27) with ¢ defined in (3.11) is almost globally asymptotically stable. Both
properties are further illustrated in figure 2b for D=62.4Dnom, T3 =3 pu and |E*| = 1.566 pu.
The bold lines correspond to the case d(t)=03, while the dashed lines correspond to the case
d, =0.25 sin(3t), dz = 0.5 sin(5t), d3 = 0.3 sin(t). It can be seen from the simulation results that the
trajectories of the perturbed system (i.e. d(t) 4 03) remain close to those of the unperturbed system
(i.e. d(t) = 03), as predicted by the ISS property.

Moreover, in line with the observations made in [30,31], figure 2a shows that the required
damping increases with the machine loading and the excitation magnitude. This is consistent with
the well-known power-angle characteristic that can be employed for reduced-order SG models

3The scaling factor 3 in J and D originates from the following fact. In [2], the mechanical equation (2.5) is expressed in pu
with respect to the three-phase base power Sy. Hence, the pu values of J, D, Tm and T. are also expressed with respect to 536.
In the model (2.5), the electrical torque T. in (2.10) is expressed with respect to the single-phase power S34 /3. Consequently,
one way to match our model (2.5) with the parameters in [2] is to scale J and D by a factor 3, i. to represent the mechanical
equation (2.5) with respect to the power base $34/3.
