approach is standard in the theory of partial differential equations. However, there is a significant
difference between domains with smooth and non-smooth boundaries. For domains with smooth
and compact boundaries of class cle, say, the operator K, is compact. Then, invertibility follows
easily by a Fredholm argument. However, compactness of K) fails to be true for domains with
non-smooth boundaries. Thus, invertibility of —31 + K, is much harder to prove in this setting
and requires more subtle tools from Harmonic Analysis. We refer to the classical papers [51] for a
potential theoretical approach to elliptic equations on graph Lipschitz domains.

(e) Domains with non compact boundaries

A key problem in the investigation of the Stokes operator in general unbounded domains is the
fact that the Helmholtz decomposition for L?(92) into L(Q\e Gp(2) does not exist, in general.
We refer to the results by Maslennikova & Bogosvkii [13], where an example of an unbounded
domain 2 with smooth boundary is constructed for which the Helmholtz decomposition exists
only for certain values of p. For an approach to the Stokes semigroup on general domains with
smooth boundaries, we refer to [52]. Their main idea is to replace the space L?({2) by TP(Q),
where L?(.2) := LP(@) NL?(@) for 2 <p < 00 and L?(@):= L?(Q) + L?(Q) for 1 <p <2 and to set

In the following, we assume that 2 C R" is a domain with uniformly C3-boundary for which
the Helmholtz projection P exists for L?(). Similarly to the case of bounded domains, we define
the Stokes operator A, in L5 (2) as

Ap :=PA, D(Ap):= W2?(2)N Wo?(2) OLE (2).
