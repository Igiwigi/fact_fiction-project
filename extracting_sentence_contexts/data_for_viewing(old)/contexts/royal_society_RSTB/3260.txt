into play. Borum* even goes so far as to state that a twig of Thuja drew mercury
16 centims. above the level of the barometer, i.c., 92 centims. in all, but this
observation has never been repeated and great doubt attaches to it. In fact,
Von Houvet has shown that, when using a simple manometer, BorHM was unable
to correctly estimate the pressures from his own measurements.

Section 8.—THr BrEeaKinG Stress of A WATER CoLUMN.

Professor Poyntine considers that perfectly pure water in a tube with perfectly
smooth and rigid walls to which it adhered with infinite tenacity would show an
almost infinitely great breaking stress, and hence arises BerTHELOT’s measurements
of over 100 atmospheres. In a personal communication, Professor WortHincTon
expresses a similar opinion, and considers that in narrow tubes the apparent breaking
strain of a water column would reach more nearly to its actual value than in a broad
tube more subject to tremors. In the vessels, however, the walls are neither smooth
