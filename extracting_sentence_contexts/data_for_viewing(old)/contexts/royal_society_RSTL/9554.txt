Radiolarians. Unfortunately, such a negative conclusion is more readily arrived at,

than @ positive one, telling what these objects really were. They are wholly unlike
_ any living organisms that we are acquainted with. Their spherical form suggests the
| poxsibility that they may have been the tests of some extinct form of Protozon. The
1 porous tissue een in fig. 80 gives some support to the idea of their having been
 Foraminiferons—and the radiating structure seen in 80 many of the transverse sections
© is quite compatible with the same idea, On the other hand it is not impossible that
l they may have had some affinity with the recent Rhabdoliths and Coccoliths, though
| this does not seem very probable. The only other possibility that suggests itself is

hat they may be reproductive capsules of some marine form of vegetation, but no facts
Sat discovered afford any definite support to this hypothesis. Mr. Bravy informs me
Z that in one instance he found indications of spore-like objects in the spherical cavity,

'Sbut the whole of the thousands which I have examined were entirely devoid of such
oments. This fact is 8uggestive of their having been filled with some material
Sjneapable of fossilisation—e.g., of sarcodic protoplasm, pointing to a Protozoan nature.
'S I have once more to acknowledge the assistance T have received from Mr. SPENCER
[and Mr. Bixxs, of Halifax, from Mr. Earxsnaw, of Oldham, and especially from Mr.

ZWUNSCH, of Glasgow, to whom we owe the discovery of the magnificent carboniferous
E forest of Laggan Bay, and whose invaluable aid demands my warmest thanks. Mr.
