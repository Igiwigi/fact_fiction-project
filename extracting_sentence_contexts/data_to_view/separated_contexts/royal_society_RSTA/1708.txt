(a) The Helmholtz decomposition

Given an open set 2 C R" and p € (1,00), the Helmholtz decomposition deals with the question
of whether L?(@) can be decomposed into a direct sum of the space of solenoidal vector
fields and the space of gradient fields. This is important due to the fact that, if such a
decomposition holds true, the Stokes equation (1.1) can then be formulated as an evolution
equation in the L?-setting. For 1 <p < oo and 2 C R" being an arbitrary open set, we set L} (2) :=
{u € C2°(2):divu=0 in aye and G)(2):= {u € LP(2):u= Vz for some m € Wi? (2)). We say
that the Helmholtz decomposition exists for L?(2) whenever L?(Q) can be decomposed into
