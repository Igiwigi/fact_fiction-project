In this 8
paper, since complete restoration may take a very long time, we argue that a concept of ‘close to : 8
normality’ is more meaningful and we therefore define recovery as being when 90% of displaced IN

people have returned to their repaired homes, 90% of disrupted businesses are back in operation
and 90% of the affected working population has returned to work. However, a different question is whether getting back to normal conditions is at all a
meaningful goal. Post-disaster ‘normal’ may not be a return to the same status as before the event;
in fact, this may be undesirable if the quality of a system could be improved to enhance resilience. Recovery from disaster may be envisaged as a process of resilience building, whereby the capacity
of a community to spring back after the initial shock of a disaster is increased [4]. Floods can act
as catalysts for human adaptation [5] and there is a ‘window of opportunity’ in the early phase
of recovery to improve resilience or ‘build back better’ [6].
