(e) Data analyses

A total of 167 primate species were represented in the phylogenetic
tree and had published brain and innovation data (strepsirrhines:
39 species, tarsids: 3 species, platyrrhines: 49 species, catarrhines:
76 species). Data on life history, social group size and diet breadth
were only available for 71 species in the innovation and brain data-
set (19 strepsirrhines, 1 tarsid, 21 platyrrhines and 30 catarrhines),
and thus analyses involving these variables were restricted to
these 71 species. A substantial number of the 167 species had no
recorded innovations. The fact that a species has zero recorded
innovations when this is unexpected for a given research effort
may be informative, but it is also possible that species with no
innovation reports have been studied differently from those with
innovation reports [25]. Thus, we also conducted analyses exclud-
ing those species with zero innovation reports in our database.
This ‘innovators’ sample covered 48 species with available
brain data.

To account for non-independence of species-level data, we used
PGLS, with phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s A) estimated by maximum-
likelihood (henceforth A = ML). Analyses were run in R v. 3.0.2 [56]
using the ‘caper’ [57] and ‘phytools’ packages [58]. Models explored
