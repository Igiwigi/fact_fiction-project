The amplitudes of the vibrations were exceedingly xmall, in fact not exceeding
S01 of an inch; and i is to this fact, coupled with the extreme rapidity and consequent decision of make
Sand break, that T mainly attribute the steadiness of the results. S * With a contact-breaker of this kind in good action several phenomena were noticeable ; but first and
.Foremost was the fact that, in a large number of tubes (especially hydrocarbons) the striw, instead of
ing sharp and flaky in form, irregular in distribution, and fluttering in position, were 8oft and rounded
Jn outline, equidistant in their intervals, and steady in proportion to the regularity of the contact-breaker. hese results arc, T think, attributable more to the regularity than to the rapidity of the vibrations. And
.Uhis view is supported by the fact that, althongh the contact-breaker may change its note (as occasionally
happens), and in £0 doing may canse a temporary disturbance in the stratification, yeb the new note may
"produce as steady a et of striw as the first: and not only 80, but frequently there is heard, simultaneonsly
Swith a pure note from the vibrator, a stridenb sonnd, indicating that contacts of two separate periods are
Heng made ; and yet, when the strident ound is regular, the strim are steady.
