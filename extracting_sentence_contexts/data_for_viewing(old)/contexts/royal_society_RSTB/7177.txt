a scar sc preventing leaf formation at J,. (Ultro Pak tracing, semi-diagrammatic, x 25.)

In the specimen illustrated in figure 65, plate 28, the apical cell was punctured and
the apical meristem isolated by vertical incisions. Of the leaf primordia present on the
meristem, three (P,, P, and P;) developed subsequently to the puncturing of the apical
cell. This specimen shows that leaf primordia may be formed close to the necrosed apical
cell, ie. P, and P,. A bud was also present, in a position near the base of the cone in the
axil of P, or between P, and P,. Scales (not shown in the illustration) were present round
the base of the cone, and also along the margin of the necrosed distal tissue; scales are never
formed in the latter position in a normal apex. A comparable specimen is illustrated in
figure 66, plate 28; in this specimen it was difficult to determine whether the largest leaves
of buds 7 and 8 really belonged to these buds or to the original shoot apex; they are, in
fact, in phyllotactic continuity with P,, P, and P,.

In the specimen illustrated in figure 64, plate 28, the apical cell was punctured with
minimal necrosis of the adjacent cells. Two new leaf primordia (P, and P,) and two buds
have been formed since the beginning of the experiment. These now abut, or almost abut,
on the necrotic distal region. Figure 67, plate 28, shows a bud formed in close proximity to
the injured apical cell. ; .

Evidence has thus been obtained that leaf primordia continue to be formed on the apical
meristem in approximately normal phyllotactic sequence and at approximately the normal
rate after the apical cell has been destroyed; this process continues until all the available
