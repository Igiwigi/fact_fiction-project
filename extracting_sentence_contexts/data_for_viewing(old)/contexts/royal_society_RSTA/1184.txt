Raman shift (cm~!)

Figure 21. SE images showing change in microstructure of sample 4 after heating to (a) 850°C, but no change is observed after
holding at (b) 850°C for 5 h. (c) Optical image, (¢) Raman spectrum map and (e) Raman spectrum showing the presence of Cu,0
in sample 4 after the final cycle. (Online version in colour.)

Cu grains having orientations other than (110) (figure 22c). Strain accumulation (figure 23d) has
been observed around the oxide particles formed on (110) surface of Cu. Observation of oxides
mostly on the (110) Cu plane is in contrast with the literature [39], which shows preferable growth
of CuO on the (111) Cu plane. As the (110) planes have higher numbers of broken bonds and
surface energy [39,40] compared to other low indices planes, (110) planes should be the prefer site
for oxidation, but growth of oxides to the highest thickness has been noted on the (111) plane [41].
This is probably due to the fact that because of high surface energy nucleation of oxides initiate
throughout the (110) plane. The formation of highly dense nuclei makes low angle boundaries
