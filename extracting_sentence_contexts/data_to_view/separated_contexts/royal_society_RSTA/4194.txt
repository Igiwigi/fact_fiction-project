I summarize the procedure for a particular S and recall results which relate
symmetries of discrete subgroups D so obtained with symmetries of the ambient Lie group G. nee)

In §7, I explore the case where VS ¥ 0. To simplify matters a little, I consider the case where the :
crystal state corresponds to the prescription of just two lattice vector fields defined on a region a]
2 CR?, and I continue to require that the crystal state allows neutral deformations. Recall that, in DN
the case VS ¥ 0, the relevant Lie group is of a dimension greater than that of the number of linearly [o
independent lattice vector fields—I make a particular choice of lattice vectors such that the lattice fo
algebra has dimension 3, in fact I make a choice such that the corresponding three-dimensional ,
Lie group is isomorphic to a group used in §6, whose discrete subgroups are described in that
section. I show how this ‘three-dimensional’ discrete structure projects to the lower dimensional
‘base’, R?, via a certain group action 4:G x R? > R?. Finally, I summarize the work and indicate how it may be extended and improved.
