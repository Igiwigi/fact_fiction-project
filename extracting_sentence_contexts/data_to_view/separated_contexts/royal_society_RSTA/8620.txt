In these expressions the parts depending on E, and I’, representing as they do forces
on the elements of the media determined solely by the conditions in those elements,
would be neglected in a mechanical theory.* The expression for the effective forcive
thus reduces to

OH\ 1-8 ween hie ee
(1S) - 4 te}-2 (Da, a

This expression is only equivalent to MAXWELL’s expression in the statical case he
considers. It is, however, practically equivalent to that derived by counting the
forces on the constituent poles, but even here the general result rather suggests a
modified conception of the force on a magnetic pole, this force involving in the
general case a term due to the electric foree. The question of the existence of forces
on a magnetic pole due to its motion in an electric field does not appear to have been
investigated on an independent basis, although it is definitely contained in , the
relations of transformation involved in the theory of relativity, which require the form
for this foreive

It will however be proved below in the next paragraph that such forces do probably
exist and are in fact of precisely the correct type. It may, of course, be objected that the last term in the equation
dB _ dH di Fe
ee +407 +4 Curl [Ty,,],
which is the origin of the discrepancy obtained for the magnetic forcive, does not in
reality exist, but yet the other results derived from this equation are almost certainly
