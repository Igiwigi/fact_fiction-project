peculiarly pointed and flamboyant character of the « which has grown out of the
solid 8 should be compared with the rounded lobes of the « combs in the chill at 805°.
The general character of the pattern in the chill at 550° resembles that in an
unchilled alloy, except that the unchilled alloy, or one chilled below 500°, would, with
the same etch, have the « dark and the ground a brilliant white. The ground,
moreover, in the chill at 550° is uniform B, but in the unchilled alloy it would be the
C’ complex.

Sn 13°5. 22°5 per cent. by weight.

This alloy is important, because it fixes the point / at which the amount of « formed
above the C temperature is just enough to re-act with the whole of the residual C
liquid in order to form B ; in fact, the re-action a, + liquide = 8; can complete itself
in this alloy.

Sn 13°5. Sic. chall at 805°.

This has less a than the chill at the same temperature of Sn 12, but otherwise it
closely resembles it ; hence we do not give a photograph.

Sn 13°5. Chills at 775°.

If an ingot of Sn 135 be cooled very slowly through the C temperature, so as to
be maintained for several hours at or very near 790°, the & is entirely dissolved and
we obtain an ingot composed wholly of B. In the photograph (fig. 23) one can see
