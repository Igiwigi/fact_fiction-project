CAYLEY'S FOURTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS.

72. It may be observed also, that in the case where a tantipartite invariant, when the y
several quantics are put equal to each other, does not become equal to zero, we may
pass back from the invariant of the single quantic to the tantipartite invariant of the
system ; thus the lineo-linear invariant ac —264'+ca' of two quadrics leads to the quadrin.
variant ac—0* of a single quantic; and conversely, from the quadrinyariant ac—}? of a
single quadric, we obtain by an obvious process of derivation the expression ac' —200 +eq
of the lineo-linear invariant of two quadrics. This is in fact included in the more general
theory explained, No. 64.

78. Reverting now to binary quantics, two quantics of the same order, even or odd,
have a lineo-linear invariant. Thns the two quadrics

(a, b, eXw, y)*, (a, b', Cw, y)*
have (it has been seen) the lineo-linear invariant
ad —20 +ca';
and in like manner the two cubics
(a, b, e, dXz, yY, (&, 8, d, d'Xw, y)*
have the lineo-linear invariant
ad'—3b&+83b'—da,,
which examples are sufficient to show the law.
