LARMOR ON A DYNAMICAL THEORY OF

and in it replace the variations of the velocities by the variations of the correspondir
co-ordinates, we shall have just obtained this virtual work. This function JF m
now be expressed in terms of any generalized co-ordinates that may be most con
venient to represent the configuration of the system for the purpose in hand, and
virtual work of the viscous forces for any virtual displacement specified by variatior
of these co-ordinates will still be derived by this rule. ‘But although in an imports
class of cases the effects of viscosity are represented by the function JF, the questi
remains open whether such a method of representation is applicable in all cases.
think it probable that it is so; but it is evident that we cannot expect to prove any
general property of viscous forces in the absence of a strict definition which wil
enable us to determine with certainty what forces are viscous and what are not.”*

89. The general variational equation of motion of the viscous system will in fact by

[or — 8W— Sf) dt = 0,

wherein 6 represents variation with respect to the co-ordinates and velocities of th
system, while 8’ represents variations with respect to the velocities only, the diffe
rentials of the velocities being in the result of the latter variation replaced by diffe:
rentials of the corresponding co-ordinates.t

90. The importance of this analysis in respect to problems in the theory of radiatior
is fundamental. If a radiation maintains its period of vibration unaltered in passi
through a viscous medium, it follows necessarily that the viscous forces of the medium
are of the type above specified.
