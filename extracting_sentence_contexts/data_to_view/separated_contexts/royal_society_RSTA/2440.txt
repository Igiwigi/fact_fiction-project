This was
first pioneered on ASDEX Upgrade which was gradually equipped with a tungsten wall and
later followed by JET, where most of the wall was changed to beryllium, while the divertor was
changed to tungsten. As a result, the tritium retention dropped by a factor of 20, to a level low
enough for ITER to be able to work for a long time without any opening to get the tritium out
[11,12]. A drawback of the metallic wall, however, is the fact that it is less straightforward to make
high-performance plasmas, as the heavy metals from the divertor have a tendency to migrate
into the core plasma. Special operational procedures are needed to achieve high-performance
operation in a metal wall tokamak. This involves ample central heating, seeding of the edge
plasma with noble gasses, flushing impurities with benign Edge Localized Modes, etc.
