times the intensity of the light emitted by a single sphere.

8. Diffusions of Copper. The Nature and Form of the Suspended Particles.

We proceed to discuss the colours produced by diffused particles of copper in order
to discover the cause of colour of copper ruby glass. The values of the expression
nr’ [pd for v = 1°56, v = 1°5, and »y = 1°0 given in Table IL., are plotted in fig. 6, the
maxima being determined as in the case of fig. 1 (ef §5 above). As in the case of
silver, these curves should fairly accurately represent the absorptions produced by
copper spheres in glass v = 1°56, in glass » = 1°5, and by copper spheres or molecules

* The fact that Ry increases from yellow to red, while R diminishes in the same range, would be
accounted for if the black paper with which Sir Witt1aM ABNryY backed the stained face of the glass
reflected 2 per cent. of the light incident on it. Further experiments are to be made on this.
