However, once
this alternative measurement is performed, the original prediction becomes meaningless as in
principle unverifiable. To put it another way, even a prediction with probability one is still only an
assignment of probability and does not mean that the quantity thus predicted is real. Indeed, this

ensembles and not of individual events [24, p. 205].


fact in effect disables EPRâ€™s criterion of reality. However, because the measurement corresponding
to the EPR prediction of P, if it is performed on Sz, always yields the predicted value, their
criterion may be seen as applicable insofar as such a measurement is possible to verify. Performing
an alternative, complementary, measurement of Q on S2 irrevocably preclude such a verification.
