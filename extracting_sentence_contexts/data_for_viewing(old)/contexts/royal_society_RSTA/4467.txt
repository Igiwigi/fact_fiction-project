the most abundant bacterial division in both the water (more than 38% of sequences) and
sediments (more than 59% of sequences). Betaproteobacteria appear to dominate other freshwater
subglacial aquatic ecosystems [77]. For example, 47% of the OTUs from samples collected below
the Robertson Glacier in the Arctic were Betaproteobacteria [78].

The analysis of nucleic acids from SLW samples revealed three betaproteobacterial OTUs
that were closely related to sequences retrieved from sediments below the KIS [18]. The
closest cultured relatives to these environmental sequences included Polarmonas glacialis (5%
of OTUs in SLW water and 1.8% in sediments), an aerobic heterotroph, which was also the
second most abundant OTU in SLW waters [7]. The OTUs with highest sequence identity to
chemolithoautotrophic organisms Sideroxydans lithotrophicus (4.8% of OTUs in SLW water and
12% in 0-2cm sediments) and Thiobacillus denitrificans (6% of OTUs in 0-2 cm SLW sediments)
were also detected in KIS sediments and could reflect the fact that both KIS and SLW sediments
originate from a similar source further upstream.

The most abundant OTU in the water column (13% of all sequences) was related to ‘Candidatus
Nitrotoga arctica’ a nitrite-oxidizing betaprotebacterium [7]. These sequences were also abundant
in the surficial sediments (7.8%). The most abundant archaeon detected (2.5% in the water
column) grouped within the Thaumarchaeota [7]. All members of this lineage currently in culture
are ammonia-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs [79]. Nitrification is likely to be an important
function in SLW based on both a high abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences related to known


ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing taxa and isotopic evidence (A!’O values of nitrate) indicative of
microbial oxidation rather than atmospheric sources [7].
