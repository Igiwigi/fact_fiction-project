Thus a widely open stoma of Fouquieria splendens, drawn by Luoyp,t has a tube-
length roughly twice that of the width of the opening. We must therefore consider
the case where the stoma is not to be reckoned an aperture in a relatively thin plate,
but rather a tube whose length is greater than its diameter. “ Diffusion through a
long pipe or channel varies as the area, and flow through it depends on a reduced
area owing to the flowing air adhering to the walls of the tube; in fact, it varies as
the square of the area if the viscosity is predominant. Thus, if this is the case,
3 provided the channels are of fairly uniform width,§ transpiration would be proportional
2 to the square root of flow—the same law as that obtained for the case of holes in a
@ thin plate.” = Sir JoserpH Larmor was good enough to calculate the size of the stomatal pores in
& the ivy from the rate of flow of an air current through them, as indicated by porometer
s readings.
