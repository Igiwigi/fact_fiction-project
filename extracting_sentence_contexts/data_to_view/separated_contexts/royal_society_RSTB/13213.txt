This prolonged epi-
genetic silencing is ultimately reversed during reproduction
and embryo development [149,150]. Resetting of FLC at
each generation [151] is essential, as it ensures that the
requirement for winter is re-established at each generation. The fact that such reprogramming likely entails a high meta-
bolic cost and is yet clearly adaptive illustrates the
evolutionary advantage of preventing the transmission
across generations of epivariants induced by seasonal cues. Although reprogramming of overall DNA methylation is
limited in plants, RdDM-dependent CHH methylation is
actively removed and re-established during sexual reproduc-
tion [98]. Thus it is tempting to draw a parallel with the active
resetting of FLC expression at each generation and to propose
that transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation var-
iants at TE-containing alleles would in most cases be
disadvantageous.
