in sufficient quantity to influence our measurements, and that if the atomic weight of
sodium be taken as 23°05+0°005, the solutions used as standards were accurate
within approximately the same limits, that is about 1 part in 5000.

were for the most part stored in platinum vessels until required, but, by taking
advantage of the relative inertness of the most concentrated solutions, we were
enabled to make use of glass bottles for storing the solutions required for determining
the temperature coefficients. In consequence, perhaps, of its extreme viscosity and the
relatively small amount of water present, a 50-per cent. solution of sodium hydroxide
has far less action on glass than a dilute solution. Its density did not alter by a
single unit in the fourth place when stored during ten weeks in a glass bottle. A
further advantage in the use of concentrated solutions is found in the fact that the
carbonate is almost insoluble, and, if produced by exposure to air, separates as a
precipitate at the bottom of the bottle, producing a small change in the concentration
of the solution, but hardly any depreciation of its purity.
