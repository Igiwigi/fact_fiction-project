Consequently, to satisfy 2k, = ky + k, requires k, = (1 — p, —4). The steepness ¢; of the three waves k;,i € {a,b,c} is the second defining parameter, which is related
to the amplitude a; by a;|k;| = ¢;. In fact, for simplicity, ec is taken to be zero throughout. The two
initially present ‘mother waves’ k, and k; will be shown to be unstable to the effects of small
inhomogeneities, and thereby give rise to the growth of the daughter wave k,. A deterministic
counterpart to this situation was recently explored experimentally by Bonnefoy et al. [17].
