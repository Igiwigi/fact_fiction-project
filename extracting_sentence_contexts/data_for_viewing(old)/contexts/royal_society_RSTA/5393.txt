slab [1], as this provides the optimal starting point in terms of the availability of proxy data to
underpin a new reconstruction. Choosing a time slice within the late, rather than early, Pliocene
has added advantages in terms of reducing the potential for significant deviations in topography
and ocean gateway configurations from present day. These factors cannot be easily determined
(ie. the Central America Seaway and the western cordillera of North and South America [40-42]),
and therefore introduce unnecessary uncertainty into a climate model’s experimental design.
Identifying a time slice in the late Pliocene also reduces the potential for non-stationarity of
environmental tolerance to bias geological proxies. In other words, the further back in time, the
greater the potential for organisms/biota to have existed in different environments than they do
today [43,44].

The PRISM project’s aim is to understand environments and climates of a warmer world [45].
This scientific need has not diminished over the past 20 years; in fact, in the context of current
estimates of future climate change, it is growing ever more acute [46]. Thus, a warm episode,
