We must therefore repeat the former conclusion
that the strong enhancements of particular lines at low pressure are peculiar to these
lines, and in fact to the three lines \\4471, 4922, 4388, of the two Diffuse series. Under still lower pressure, 14922 may be expected to become quite subordinated to
44388, which is already as strong in our experiments, and in the very low conditions
of pressure in nebule, \\4471, 4388, should therefore be the two most prominent
Helium lines of the Diffuse series. This is a well-known fact of observation in
astrophysics. We may now take up the consideration of the effect of a trace of Hydrogen. Inspection of the table is almost sufficient to show that the energy-transfer to longer
