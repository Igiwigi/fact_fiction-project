since — 31 is the next discriminant of a complex cubic field after — 23. At present, no method
is known which offers hope of proving this; but possibly the fact that theorem 13 indicates
the existence of a second minimum for this problem may lead to further work on the question. The conjecture just referred to has a bearing on the important unsolved problem of
simultaneous Diophantine approximation to two irrational numbers @, ®. If ¢ denotes
the lower bound of the numbers c’ such that the inequalities

The above conjecture, if true, would allow one to replace the upper estimate (23) by 731) :
