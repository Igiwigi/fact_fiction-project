For photometrical experiments, it should be remembered that whilst bf - express
the relative brigltness of the w—_ and incident rays, primary and secondary, ©
and - / must be multiplied by = ; to obtain the proper photometrical ratios for the
comparison of the refracted wo Ka rays.

39. For the © critical angle* at which sin 8=5, we have sin 0=w,,

P=p, 4=9:

p,=0, q=0. Both rays are therefore reflected without loss of intensity, and this is true notwith-
Standing any absorptive tendency of the medium, which in fact the rays do not enter. Compare No. 26 and No. 27

40. The general value of the polarizing angle for which 9q'=0, will be determined
by the equations
