It also saw remarkable developments in the technologies enabling qualitative =
studies on the molecular level. Instrumental techniques such as scanning tunnelling microscopy, 3
confocal microscopy, capillary electrophoresis or nuclear resonance spectrometry had enabling
roles in the rise of several branches of scienceâ€”nanotechnology, genetics and bioimaging. In nee)
fact, technology is vital for the rapid growth of these disciplines. The employed techniques :
had to catch up with the demand for the increased performance and outstanding specifications. a]
A mismatch between the capabilities of technology platforms and the requirements of target DN
applications could lead to erroneous results and flawed conclusions, which might subsequently iG
mislead scientists and policy-makers. 8

While qualitative analysis tools played a huge role in many important discoveries in the past ,
centuries, modern science increasingly relies on quantitative data. Discoveries in fundamental
research as well as industrial and clinical applications often require reporting relative or absolute
quantities of target molecules.
