— 0.6 <A: very strong specific molecular interactions.

This classification can be improved by further investigations of amorphous mixtures with various
molecular interactions. The model developed in [41] can be generalized in order to describe the
conditions in different systems without cluster formation (see electronic supplementary material,
Appendix). The result shows that the interaction parameter A is linked to the difference of the
excess enthalpy of mixing between the liquid and the glassy state, Ale.

In our nomenclature, the carbonate mixture is component A and water component B. The
parameter k= 7.27 is determined by curve fitting (figure 4). For the fit, we used the value of
505 K (sample KMG6-2) as the value for Tg 4. Figure 4 shows the residual plot of the fit. All
glass transition temperatures (Tg, fictive) can be fitted within + 6 K; the ’ is 0.999.

It is ACpB = 1.94 J/(gK) for amorphous water [42]. For the intensity of the glass transition
of the carbonate mixture, we determined AC, 4 = (0.60 + 0.06) J/(gK). This leads to ky =3.2 and
A=0.49. The difference between k and ko is quite large. The interaction parameter A is close to
the system water-trehalose indicating strong specific molecular interactions between water and
the carbonates in the glassy state. The relatively high value of A could also indicate a relatively
large decrease in the excess enthalpy of mixing during the conversion of the glassy state into the
liquid state at the glass transition. This may explain the water loss after the glass transition.

The formation of glasses in carbonate systems is problematic, since carbonates are ionic liquids
