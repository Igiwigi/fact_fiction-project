ON THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM. 305

temperature, drying, &c., these influence the electrical resistance of the tissue sur-
rounding by altering the moisture with which it is infiltrated. The result is to cause
an alteration in the balance previously existing between the currents due to the tissue
and the compensator source. The character of this will be made evident by citing a
case.

The sciatic nerve, prepared as above, and hanging free in air, was connected by its
cross section and surface with the galvanometer electrodes, the resting difference
between the contacts was compensated at first by a difference of ‘01 D. The nerve
was then moistened between the contacts, this necessitating a reduction of the
ompensation to 0085 D. This alteration is obviously due to the fact that the
Ghcreased moisture has decreased the resistance in the surface of the nerve, and
hereby increased the intensity of all currents which are present in that region.
Phese currents are, first, a portion of the balancing current, and secondly, the derivation
Girrents between the surface and cross section of the nerve. Whilst these two are
gqually affected between the points of contact of the electrodes, the result as regards
she galvanometer circuit is very different. This will be rendered clear if we remember
‘that the tissue difference is usually that obtained by connecting two surface points of
& Series of closed circuits, through which currents flow, and that the resistance of the
‘Breuits varies inversely with the amount of tissue moisture, so that the amount of
Bpread, and thus the particular derivation on the surface, is diminished by the

creased moisture. The final result is that, as regards the galvanometer circuit, there
