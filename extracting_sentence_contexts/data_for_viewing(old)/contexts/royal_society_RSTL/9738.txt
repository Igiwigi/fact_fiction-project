munch justice that it is probable that it is only the first burst of the response that is
> \intense enough to give phosphorescence, and that the absence of continuous phos-
- phorescence in this case is no proof thab there is nob a gentle continuous discharge
from what we have previously called the connected terminal. But even if we allow
this it is clear that the main part of the discharge from the negative terminal in
e case of a positive air-spark must take place in an extremely shorb space of time.
= Although phosphorescence is intermittent, like all the other luminous phenomena, of
2the sensitive discharge, there are many reasons which make it desirable to treat it
rately from the luminous discharge. Tt is not, like strie? or the negative glow, a
of the phenomena of gaseous discharge properly s0 called, but it is the effect of a
hanical radiation which accompanies the discharge. It is a diagram, a projected
Simage of that radiation upon the surface of the glass ; while itself, it is the quasi-
accidental effect, of the fact that glass is the most convenient 8ubstance for transparent,
*Siubes, and that glass is usually made of snbstances which will give such phosphor-
-Sexcence when exposed to streams of rapidly moving particles such as those in question.
Hence it is only a secondary phenomenon of gaseous discharge, and for clearness it
| Savill be well to treat it quite separately, and as in no way a part of the luminosity due
Sto the discharge. But jusb as the relief and special effects in the luminous discharge
2 due to interference with the actual main discharge by means of artificially produced
discharges of like period, s0 it is found that the phosphorescence which is due to the
-Smain discharge is capable of being affected in a similar way, though, of course, the
"une are wholly different to those special and relief-effects of which we treated in
Four former paper, and which relate to the Inminous column itself, 1.e., to phenomena
