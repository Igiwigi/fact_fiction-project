The whole of the facts connected with the meteorology of
Aden of which I have made use, are from observations taken by Sergeant Moyss,
with excellent instruments, and Dr. Butsr is now passing the observations through
the press. These facts, which could be very greatly multiplied, have been somewhat dwelt
upon, with a view to a right understanding of HumBoLprT's observations in his Cosmos*,

320 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL

where, speaking of the horary oscillations of the barometer, be says, © their regularity
is 80 great, that in the day-time especially, the hour may be ascertained from the
height of the mercurial column without error, on the average of fifteen or seventeen
minutes. In the torrid zones of the new continent, on the coasts, as well as at eleva-
tions of nearly 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, where the mean temperature
falls to 44*6, IT have found the regularity of the ebb and flow of the atrial ocean un-
disturbed by storms, hurricanes, rain and earthquakes.” It is now shown that the
borary oscillations have a different range in different months of the year; their range
is influenced by height above the sea, and the tides do not always flow and ebb in
equal periods of time; but the existence of two ascending and two descending but
unequal tides within twenty-four hours within the tropics, is established beyond all
question ; and if not altogether undisturbed, as HumBorDr says, by storms, hurricanes
or rain, yet the meteorological records in India prove that the periodic daily move-
ments of the aGrial ocean are never suppressed®,

Pressure of the Atmosphere. With respect to the mean pressure of the atmosphere in India near the sea-level,
I sball limit myself to the insertion of a comparative table showing the means of four
years' hourly observations at Madras, the means of two years' hourly observations at
Bombay, and the observations taken every two hours (but during the day only) at
Calcutta, for 1843-44 and 1848.
