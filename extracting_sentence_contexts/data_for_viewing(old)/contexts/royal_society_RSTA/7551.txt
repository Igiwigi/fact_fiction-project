17. The next system to be considered is (zu) ¥
reducible. The argument which establishes this is very similar to that of §12. The two rows
in the chain must contain at least two common symbols, so that we may take ijk, ijp to denote
the symbols which occur, in some order, in these rows. The bracket outside is (abu), where
a,b are the extreme symbols in the upper row of the chain. By replacing & by (lu) and w
es k @ which = 0 by §ile-we see tat (is) xo ge ‘ = 0, which
can equally be written in the form — (liu) es . b ‘ = 0. Neglecting these forms, the

by 7 in the form

possible forms to be considered are obtained from those enumerated in §12 by merely
suppressing the extreme factors a,, 6, and replacing them by (abu). The effect of this is that
the forms denoted by accented symbols do not arise for separate consideration, since they arise
from the corresponding unaccented forms by a change of sign. We may denote the forms
so arising by the same symbols as those used in § 12, remembering that now we have the
additional relations $+.S’ = 0, where S is any one of the sixteen forms A,, ..., H).

The reduction of these follows, mutatis mutandis, the same course as that in§ 12. In the forms -
of § 10 we replace x, j, g, u by (ju), 1, 7,7 respectively. The identification of the resulting forms
