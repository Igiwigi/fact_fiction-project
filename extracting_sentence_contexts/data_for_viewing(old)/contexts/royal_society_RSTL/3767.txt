and the efferent vessels are both injected, but only a fragment of the tuft (fig. 2).
Sometimes the injected fluid has burst out immediately on entering the first branches

* It is worthy of notice, as showing both the difficulty of the subject and the uncertain state of our know-
ledge up to the present time, that Bzznes, the distinguished Professor of Vienna, in his recently pnblished work
on microscopical anatomy, maintains the existence of a direct inosculation of the uriniferous tubes with the ca-
pillary plexus surrounding them. After the description already given, I need hardly say, that this view seems
to me, for many reasons, altogether untenable.

+ T have great pleasure in $tating that my friend Mr. Towss, three years ago, during his examination of
numerous kidneys that, he had injected, saw two or three examples of this escape of the injection along the
tube; of one of which he has preserved a rough outline. Not being able to see it again he gave up the search.
I have no doubt that he communicated this fact to me in conyersation at the time, though I cannot now recol-
lect his doing 80. The first drawing I made of the tube expanded over the tuft, I find dated February 17, 1841 ;
about which time my interest in the subject was first excited.

t Of course this neyer occurs in Birds, where the Malpighian vezsel is a coiled ampulla,

of the tuft: it has then insinuated itself between the ball of vessels and the capsule,
and has run off along the tube. In this case the tuft is left uninjected and contain-
ing blood, and it becomes enveloped in a film of injection (fig. 9). Sometimes one
side only of the tuft is injected at the moment when extravasation occurs, sometimes
