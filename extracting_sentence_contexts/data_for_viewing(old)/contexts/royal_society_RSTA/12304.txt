erved on reversal was also no doubt spurious. I feel sure that I have never
bserved a genuine reversible shift of the middle band due to rotation.

Now the light was going three times round the frame, and if the ether had been
wried round full speed with the disk there would have been a shift of 34 bands, or
50 divisions at each rotation, or over 1000 divisions in all, whereas not more than
wo divisions at the outside were seen, and they might readily be spurious.

In saying they were spurious, I mean not that a shift so small as this could not be
erved, but that there was amply sufficient tremor to account for it

The entire absence of perceptible shift at about 800 revolutions, before any
portant tremor has occurred, is to me really the most conclusive fact ; and I feel
nfident that either the ether between the disks is quite unaffected by their motion,
*, if affected at all, that it is by something less than the thousandth part. At the
e time, so far as rigorous proof is concerned, I should prefer to assert that THE
LOCITY OF LIGHT BETWEEN TWO STEEL PLATES MOVING TOGETHER IN THEIR OWN
ANE AN INCH APART 18 NOT INCREASED OR DIMINISHED BY SO MUCH AS ggoTH
RE OF THEIR VELOCITY.
