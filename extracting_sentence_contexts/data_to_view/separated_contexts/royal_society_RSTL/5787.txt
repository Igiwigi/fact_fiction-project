The alleged parallelism and uniform thickness of the beds in the escarpments
of the Val del Bove, proves on closer inspection to be a delusion, for the lavas vary in
strength and frequently thin out, being only persistent for great distances in the line of
their dip, or the direction in which they originally flowed.

8thly. The ancient and highly inclined lavas are usually free from arches and flexures
on a great scale, bearing a nearer resemblance to those parts of recent currents which
have congealed on steep slopes than to those which have cooled on more level ground.

9thly. The scarcity of faults in the lavas of various ages, and the fact that the lavas do
not cut through the dikes although the dikes 80 often cut through them, is opposed to
the doctrine that a considerable amount of upheaval has been due to the injection of
lavas in conformable sheets between pre-existing beds of tuff and scoriz.

10thly. As the dikes are of various ages and do not all radiate from the two supposed
centres of eruption, the verticality of 80 many of them is inconsistent with the elevation-
crater hypothesis; for if the beds were originally horizontal, and owed their present-
steep dip to a final catastrophe, nearly all the dikes would be as much out of the per-
pendicular as are the intersected lavas and scoriz. Lastly.
