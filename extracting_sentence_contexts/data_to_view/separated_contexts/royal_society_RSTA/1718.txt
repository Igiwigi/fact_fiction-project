Let K(E) C £(E) denote the space of all compact linear operators on E. For every R € L(E), we
call
[IRlless == inf{||R — K||: K € K(E)},

the essential norm of R. In fact, ||- lle; is a Semi-norm on L(E) (and technically speaking, the
essential norm of an operator R € L(E) coincides with the quotient norm of the equivalence class
of R in the Calkin algebra L(E)/K(E)). Proposition and Definition 3.3 (Asymptotically compact semigroups). A semigroup S on E
is called asymptotically compact (often also quasi-compact) if it satisfies the following equivalent
assertions:

(1) limp co IIS(lless = 0-
(ii) There exists a times t € (0,00) such that ||S(t)lless < 1.
