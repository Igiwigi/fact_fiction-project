environment for solving problems formally in a finite action space. By using Peano, we formalized
five sections of the algebra curriculum from the Khan Academy educational platform. Search
alone is unable to find solutions to non-trivial problems because of a combinatorial explosion
of the search space. RL provides a means to learn from past searches and make progress, but
even then, longer solutions are unreachable. But combining RL with abstraction learning—in the
form of tactic induction, where we learn useful reusable components from solutions found so
far—allows an agent to make progress, learning to solve all problems across our five sections of

algebra. :

In addition to enabling an agent to solve problems more effectively, we have found : =
abstraction learning to match our intuition about which higher-level skills students need to : =
master when learning basic algebra. This was reflected in the fact that reordering problems using 1B
the dependencies between abstractions in their solutions largely recovers the Khan Academy : =
curriculum ordering. Note that human curricula are designed with more than problem ordering 8

in mind: they also aim to facilitate instruction, where conceptual cohesion is important. These
aspects are irrelevant for our agents, since they only learned from attempting problems. Even so,
the dependencies implied by the learned abstractions recovered some of the structures present
in the human-designed curriculum, suggesting that they capture a key aspect of the curriculum
design.

Moreover, ordering problems based on abstractions interacts favourably with our model
of inductive learning of abstractions. Such an ordering can focus the agent on problems that
elicit new abstractions which are concisely expressed in terms of the agent’s already learned
