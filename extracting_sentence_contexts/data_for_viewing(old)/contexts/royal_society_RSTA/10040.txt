(1) Possible erroneous identification of a spectrum reference line in the neighbour-
hood and consequent wrong determination of \ observed ;

(2) Bad division errors of the spectroscope circle ;

(3) Bad error in some of the weights employed at these points ;

(4) Systematic change of personality of observer in this neighbourhood, due to
change of colour ;

(5) Actual variation of the law of stress-optical effect in this neighbourhood.

(1) is ruled out by the fact that in the glass 3453, where the effect was first

noticed, it was discovered, not from any such curve, but from the actual circle
readings of the spectroscope, which usually increased by steadily increasing differ-
ences ; in this glass, just after the readings corresponding to d 5000, the difference
decreased instead of increasing. Readings were taken several times with great care,
and the effect was confirmed in each case. This demonstrated that the cause was
not accidental.
