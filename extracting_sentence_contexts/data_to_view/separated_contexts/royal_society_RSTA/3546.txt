Being thus
Le furnished with the means, I was able to resume my attempt under favourable
& conditions, and this paper is the result. = The substance of the analysis of this paper is, of course, essentially the same as his,
s but the arrangement and notation are so different that the two present but little
Ã© superficial resemblance. This difference arises, partly from the fact that I desired to
a use my own notation for the ellipsoidal harmonics, and partly because during the time
ie that I was working at the analysis his paper was still unprinted and therefore
3 inaccessible to me. But it is, perhaps, well that the two investigations of so
3 complicated a subject should be nearly independent of one another. GE Tt is rather unfortunate that I did not feel myself sufficiently expert in the use of
B the methods of Wrrmrstrass and ScHwnrz to evaluate the elliptic integrals after the

methods suggested by M. Porncart, but every exertion has been taken to insure
correctness in the arithmetical results, on which the proof of stability depends.
