(B.) Corona Radiata.—The cortex having been thoroughly exposed, a sharp
scalpel was passed horizontally through the hemisphere in the plane of the centre of
the coronal gyrus, and the upper and anterior thirds raised as a lid of a box. Pieces
of amadou were then gently laid and pressed on the edges of the cut, thus arresting
the free bleeding from the vessels of the pia mater. Care was always taken to
determine precisely the topography of the section, and to accurately apply the
electrodes to the fibres coming from the requisite area of the cortex. The necessity

of this care is obvious to those who are familiar with the limitation of the fibres in
the corona radiata, but we think it well to mention the fact, as a malposition of 2 mm.
is sufficient, with the stimulus we employed, to prevent the production of the effect.

2. Exposure of Peripheral Nerves.

The great sciatic nerve was usually selected for this purpose, and was exposed in
the thigh for 6 centims. of its length. It was then divided near the knee, and its
central end ligatured, care being taken to prevent any pull upon the structure, or any
