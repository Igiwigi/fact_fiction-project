First, the concept of ‘transfer’ of information from hippo-
campus to cortex is no longer accepted. Instead, parallel
encoding is now considered explicitly, with hippocampal-—
neocortical interactions serving to stabilize neocortical traces
selectively. Second, according to a multiple trace theory,
event memory can be subdivided into context-specific episo-
dic memory that is stored in hippocampus (‘what, where and
when’), and semantic memory for ‘facts’ stored in neocortex
[36]. Episodic memory is analogous to Marr’s recording of
events—the memory of things that happen during the day. Semantic memory is the corpus of factual knowledge
acquired through formal training or from our interpretation
and recoding of events.
