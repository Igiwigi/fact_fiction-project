ship as that which occurs in Man and all other mammalia.

The defective proportions of the part representing the great transverse commissure
of the placental mammal, which appears to me to result from, or, at all events, to be
related to. the peculiar conformation ,of the wall of the hemisphere, must, not lead to
the inference that the great medullary masses of the two halves of the cerebrum are by
any means * disconnected.‚Äù 'The want of the upper fibres is compensated for in a
remarkable manner by the immense size of the anterior commissure, the fibres of which
are seen radiating into all parts of the interior of the hemisphere. 'There can be little
doubt but that the development of this commissure is, in a certain measure, comple-
mentary to that of the corpus callosum. That it is not simply correspondent with the
large size of the olfactory ganglion, as Professor OwEgx has suggested, is shown by the
fact that in the Hedgehog and some other placental mammals this ganglion attains a
far greater proportionate volume than in many marsupials, and yet the commissure is
very considerably smaller.

In descending the series from Man to the Placental Mammals of lowest cerebral
organization, the great change in the condition of the corpus callosum has been seen to
be, the disappearance of the rostral portion, and the coincident greater development of
the posterior folded or psalterial portion ; the latter being connected with the relative
increase of the hippocampal region of the cerebrum. In the brain of the marsupial a
change of precisely the same nature is carried to an excess, There is, however, as far as
my observations show, no structure characteristic of the higher group which is absent in
the lower.
