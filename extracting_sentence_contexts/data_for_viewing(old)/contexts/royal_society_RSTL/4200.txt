if steam it may be called, for the state of this atmosphere at the first immersion of
the platinum is at present very mysterious.

I think I may now safely regard it as proved, that platinum intensely ignited will
decompose water, and seyeral considerations press on the mind in reflecting on this
novel phenomenon.

First of all, to those who are attached to the ci bono argument, and estimate
physical science in proportion only to its practical applications, I would say that
these experiments afford some promise of our being, at, no distant period, able to
produce mixed gases for purposes of illumination, &c. by simply boiling water and
passing it through highly ignited platinum tubes, or by other methods which may be
devised ; we in fact by this means, as it were, boil water into gas, and there appears
theoretically no more simple way of producing chemical decomposition.

To pass however to more important considerations : the spheroidal state, which has
lately attracted the attention of philosophers, appears to be closely connected with
these results, and is rendered more deeply interesting. "The last experiment but two
which I have mentioned, shows that the spheroidal state is intermediate between ordi-
nary ebullition and the decomposing ebullition ; it is probably therefore a state of polar
tension, coordinate in 8ome respects with that which takes place in the cell of a voltaic
combination before decomposition, or when the power employed not being of sufficient
intensity to produce actual decomposition, the state commonly called polarization of
the electrodes, obtains. The phenomenon brings out also a new relation between
heat, electricity, and chemical affinity ; hitherto many electrical phenomena could be
