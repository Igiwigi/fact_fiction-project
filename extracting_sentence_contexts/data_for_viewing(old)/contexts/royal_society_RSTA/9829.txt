If the existence of the oun as a definite proportion of the (atomic weight)’ be
considered as: established, the best and most direct method of determining the value
of the factor g would be from the discussion of an element in which the spectroscopic
data are good and in which the atomic weight has been determined with great
accuracy. For this purpose we naturally turn to silver. Regarded as the ultimate
standard of atomic weight determinations, no error in the atomic weight enters—the
value of g is determined in terms of W = 107°88. Moreover its separation is large,
so that any error of measurement is a small fraction of its total value, and in addition
the actual error is extremely small. It is therefore tantalising to find that the lines,

D (2) excepted, are not susceptible of such exact measures as in many others, that
the typical series are not well developed, and that in fact there may be a doubt
whether the lines generally accepted as the P, 8, D series follow laws altogether
analogous to those in other groups. In Kayser and Runeer’s measures four lines are
assigned to D,, (2-5) and three to D, (2-4), the possible errors for D., being much less
