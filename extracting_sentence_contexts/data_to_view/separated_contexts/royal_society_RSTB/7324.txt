536 S. M. MANTON ON STUDIES ON THE ONYCHOPHORA. VII

The opposite view, quoted above, concerning the ancestry of the viviparous non-yolky
Onychophora of type 2 cannot be seriously entertained. Willey (1898) states that ‘there is no
reason whatever to suppose that there has been a secondary loss of yolk’ in P. capensis and in
Paraperipatus novae-britanniae, but he obtained no clear details of either segmentation of germ-
layer formation, and had in fact no data with which to uphold his views. Bouvier had no
embryological evidence of his own. His views are discussed on p. 538.
