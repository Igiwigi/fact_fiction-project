A. FOWLER ON SERIES LINES IN SPARK SPECTRA.

of proto-helium is primarily of the Fundamental type; the three associated series
may be regarded as coincident with it.

(9) The “ Pickering ” lines associated with the “4686” series are also probably due
to proto-helium, in which case the series would include lines nearly coincident with
the Balmer series. The observational evidence on this point is incomplete, but the
assignment of these lines to proto-helium is supported by the fact that one of the new
combination series of magnesium is related to the “4481” series exactly as the
extended Pickering series would be related to the “‘ 4686 ” series.

(10) The slight differences between the observed positions of alternate lines of the
“ 4686” series and those calculated by Rypsere for the “ Principal ” series of hydrogen
are in very close agreement with Bonr’s theoretical formulz for hydrogen and proto-
helium. Adopting these formule, the spectroscopic data give a provisional value for
the mass of the hydrogen atom, in terms of that of the electron, as 1836412; or
1855+12 when the data are corrected to the International scale of wave-lengths.

(11) The appearance of the Rydberg constant in enhanced lines series with four
times its usual value may be explained on Bour’s theory by supposing that series of
the are type are produced when only one electron is removed from each of the atoms
involved, while in the case of enhanced lines two electrons are removed.

(12) A preliminary examination of terrestrial and celestial spectra has given no
indications of series requiring still greater multiples of the Rydberg constant in the
formule representing them. The author has pleasure in acknowledging his obligations to Mr.
