Distension alters the

lung architecture by altering fibre tension, especially the tension of elastic fibres. In the living lung,
it is very probable that active contraction of plain muscle in the mouths of alveolar ducts and their
main subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of respiration and 5 days’
growth in vivo can be so completely reproduced by artificial distension, as it were in vitro, is good reason
to believe that subdivision of the respiratory lumen in both cases depends upon the same factor, the
tension in elastic fibres. PART 1. ALVEOLAR EPITHELIUM IN THE RABBIT’S LUNG

INTRODUCTION

One of the unsolved problems of lung structure is concerned with the existence of an
epithelium covering the alveoli.
