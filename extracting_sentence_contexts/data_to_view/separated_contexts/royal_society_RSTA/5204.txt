Hence, we recover the power threshold obtained in [15] and reported
above: pin = (2Ro xo)~!. As discussed in [15], with a Gaussian initial condition, a slightly different
growth rate is found for the instability, but the threshold condition is unchanged. Because
the synchronization transition leads to a bunching of the fictitious oscillators around the (self-
selected) phase w, in the x-space this corresponds to the formation of complementary periodic
structures ~ cos(q-x â€” ) for the atomic density and the optical intensity. We remark that the sign
of the optical potential is positive for blue detuning (5 > 0) and negative for red detuning (5 < 0),
so that when 5 > 0 the density and optical profiles are shifted by half a wavelength (figures 2
and 4). The onset of the optomechanical instability can thus be reinterpreted as a Kuramoto
transition to a synchronized state with a self-selected phase y where the threshold for this
process is determined by the initial spread of the oscillator frequencies.
