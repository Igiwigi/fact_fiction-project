By converse of the same rule which gives an estimate of
extreme rarity at the moon's surface, we may form a con-
ception at what distance round the sun refraction from 8uch
a cause should be perceived. If we calculate at what appa-
rent distance from the body of the sun his force is equal to
that of gravity at the surface of the earth, it is there that his
power would be sufficient to accumulate (from an infinitely
divisible medium filling all space) an atmosphere* fully
equal in density to our own, and consequently producing a
refraction of more than one degree, in the passage of rays
obliquely through it. If the mass of the sun be considered as 330.000 times that
of the earth, the distance at which his force is equal to gra-

vity will be +/339.000, or about 575 times the earth's radius;
and if his radius be 111,5 times that of the earth, then this

. distance will be £5

5 OT 5-15 times the sun's radius; and

15' 49x 5,15 =1* 21' 29”, will be the apparent distance from
the sun's centre on the 2gd of May, when the following ob-
servatiuns were made, :

What deduction should be allowed for the effect of heat,

* Such an atmosphere would, in fact, be of greater density on account of the far
greater extent of the medium affected by the solar attraction, although of extreme
rarity ; but the addition derived from this source, may be disregarded in the present
estimate, without prejudice to the argument, which will not be found to turn upon
any minute difference.


finite extent of the atmosphere. 93

It may be time to consider when we have learned the amount
of apparent refraction at some given distance; and we may
then begin to conjecture, whether heat can counteract the
increase of density that would occur in the approach of only
2; of a second towards his centre.*

As I had not any instrument in my possession that I con-
sidered properly adapted for the purpose, I requested the
assistance of several astronomical friends in watching the
progress of Venus to the sun for some days preceding supe-
rior conjunction, and in recovering sight of her afterwards. But neither the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, nor Pro-
fessor BRINKLEY of Dublin, nor Mr. SouTn, with the admira-
ble instruments they possess, were able to make any obser-
vation within the time required, not being furmshed with the
peculiar means adapted to this inquiry.
