Theorem 2.2 (Wendland [21], theorem 10.12). Let k(x,x’)= op exp(—||x — x’||?/2A7) be the
squared-exponential kernel. The corresponding RKHS 1, can be written as

Aepl2
Hy = 4 €L2(R") NCR"): Ilyllay = = | FIyl(on? exp (: ll ) dw < ~| , (2.6)

where co is a constant that depends on n and i, and F is the Fourier transform.

The above results shows that for any y € Hx, the magnitude of its Fourier transform |F[y]()|
decays exponential fast as || > oo and the speed of decay increases with 2. Analogous results
exist for the case of Matérn kernels [21].

A fundamental property of GPR schemes is the fact that one can obtain a priori estimates for the
accuracy of the surrogate model. In particular, for the case of GPR schemes, we have the following
error estimate:

Proposition 2.3 (Stuart & Teckentrup [22], proposition 3.5). Suppose that 9(x) and k(x, x’) are given
by the GPR scheme (2.5). Then

wee, Iy(x) — 7X) =K(x,x)"? 2 (2), (2.7)
Yl

where the supremum occurs when the functions y(-) and k(.,x) are linearly dependent.

Based on this result which involves the accuracy of the surrogate map, we will derive the
