This is contrary to one’s intuition of non-contextuality. In the most recent publications therefore [1,2], we modified our approach into ‘CbD 2.0’,
by positing that a coupling for conteNt-sharing measurements should be computed so that it
maximizes the probability of coincidence for every pair (equivalently, every subset) of them. In our
case, this means maximization of Pr (Tj = Ti), Pr (T; = Tj] and Pr (Tj = Tj] (it is in fact sufficient
to maximize only certain pairs rather than all of them, but this is not critical here). Such a coupling
(Ti, Ty, T}) is called multimaximal. With only binary rvs involved, a multimaximal coupling always
exists and is unique; and a subsystem of a non-contextual system then is always non-contextual.
