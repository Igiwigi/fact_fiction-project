Sulphuret of zine appeared to be a more perfect non-conductor of
common electricity as well as the sulphuret of antimony, than the red oxides
of those metals. Amongst the rocks preyalent in Cornwall, clay-slate or © killas” seemed to
possess the property of conducting common electricity in a slight degree, but
only in the direction of its cleavage, perhaps owing to the moisture it retained. I mention these facts in some detail, because it is curious to observe that the
conducting power of metallic ores appears to have no reference to any of the
electrical or other properties of the metals in a pure state, or to the proportion
of them in combination. Silver and mercury, for example, are combined with,
comparatively, very small quantities of sulphur ;—and zinc, which seems to
hold an opposite place to silver in the electrical scale, is also found in combi-
nation with a much less proportion of sulphur than is contained in copper
pyrites, though the latter is one of the best mineral conductors of electricity. There are many other analogous examples, which prove that no conclusion
can be drawn A priori, from the nature or chemical arrangements of minerals,
as to their relative electrical properties.
