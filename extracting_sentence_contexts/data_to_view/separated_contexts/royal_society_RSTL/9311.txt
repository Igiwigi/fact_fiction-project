PROPERTIES OF MATTER IN THE GASEOUS STATE. 795

Pundoamental Theorems.

80. On the asswmptions I. to V., remembering the fact pointed out in Arts. 75
and 79 with respect to the component velocities of the resultant uniform gas, the
following theorems are established :—

Theorem (I.).—Zach of the several inequalities, as defined in Art. 78, in every ele-
mentary group of molecules which in a unit of time leave an element of volume of
small but definite 8ize will severally be less than in the corresponding elementary
group, which in the same time enter the element in the same direction by quantities
which bear approximately the same relation to the mean mequalities of the two
groups, as the distance through the element in direction of the group bears to a
distance (s) which is « function of the density of the gas, and the mean s8quare of the
velocity of the molecules only.
