When we
test it directly by crossing K and HE, the results are equivocal. F, has 24 K broods
and 21 E broods, all of low E-ness, & = 5-5, and as a whole it is « rather than <, though
definitely more « than the « put into the cross. In F, the ratio between E and K
broods (16 : 51) would pass for 1 : 3, but the E broods quite fail to reproduce the high
E-ness of the original E parent, and they are in fact not certainly different qua per-
centage of dextrals from the E broods of F,. We may evade these difficulties by
assuming (1) that dominance is incomplete, (2) that the high E-ness put into the cross
is masked by the vigour of heterosis. This brings us into the predicament that we
cannot be sure whether a brood of, say, 150 sinistrals and 2 dextrals is a masked < brood
or a x brood, and, if we assume that these alternatives are exclusive, makes the formal
interpretation of K x E crosses impossible.
