The slant down from left to right is one of the most prominent features in the primary
pulses FF and HH, and it also presents itself in the corresponding secondary pulses.

The primary pulse FF shows, in addition to the peak in day , a hollow in day n +- 2.
The peak is represented in the secondary pulse only by an arrest in the downward slope
on day x + 27, but the hollow is fairly represented at day n +29. The departure from
a straight line in the primary pulse HH is trifling ; in the secondary pulse the tendency
to a concavity with turning point at day » + 28 is more apparent. In the case of JJ,
the concavity is quite prominent in both the primary and secondary pulses, but the
minimum appears on day n + 1.

The special features in the primary pulses FF and HH, and to a minor extent in JJ,
arise from the fact that character figures 0-7, 0-6 and 0-5, especially the first two,
occur most often when disturbance is on the down grade. As is suggested by the shape
of the primary pulses AA to CC, the rise to disturbance, especially to outstandingly
large disturbance, is usually more rapid than the decline. The days of characters 0-7»
0-6 and 0-5, when combined, as in the 7th line of Table II, and in the curve GG of fig. 1,
supply a fairly regular primary pulse, and the corresponding secondary pulse is
similarly regular. The minima in these pulses appear on days » + 1 and n + 28. The
27-day interval is thus clearly apparent, the only special feature being the relatively
large amplitude of the secondary pulse.

The last line in Table II and the curve KK of fig. 1 are based on the international
quiet and associated days. The recovery from the depressions at days » and » -- 27
is more rapid than the previous falls. ;
