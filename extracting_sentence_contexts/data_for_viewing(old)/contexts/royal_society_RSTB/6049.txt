suggested the whole of the primary (extra-embryonal) mesoderm (including that part
of it which forms the primitive connecting stalk) is derived, and though it is not possible
to speak with certainty, it does appear as if the contribution of the primary mesoderm
to the stalk was larger in the Anthropoid than in the Pithecoid. But whether this be
so or not, the important facts remain that in both the primitive connecting stalk consists
at first of so-called primary mesoderm, and that this is later reinforced by the addition
of mesoderm proliferated from the primitive streak.

As in Tarsius and the Anthropoids, the endodermal constituent of the connecting
stalk in the Pithecoids normally appears to have the form of a slender tubular (allantoic)
canal with a thickish epithelial wall, which terminates blindly in the mesenchyme of
the proximal portion of the stalk. In the 3-2 mm. embryo of Cebus 475, it measures
in diameter 0-2 x 0-085 mm. But it is a curious and interesting fact that in the 6 mm.

embryo of Hapale jacchus, as I have elsewhere recorded ('19, cf. also 28) the allantoic
canal is represented by a flattened cavity, 2-5 mm. in length by 2 mm. in width, with a
quite thin lining of endoderm, which extends along one side of the connecting stalk and
whose outer wall is likewise extremely thin. At this stage, accordingly, the connecting
stalk of Hapale may be described as possessing an allantoic cavity and as semi-
vesicular. It is thus of interest as presenting us with a condition which is in some
degree intermediate between the primitive vesicular allantois of the Lemur and the
almost solid connecting stalk of the other higher Primates. But the condition here
