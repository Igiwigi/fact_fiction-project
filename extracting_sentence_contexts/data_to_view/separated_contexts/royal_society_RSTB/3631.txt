N.). I do
not profess to understand the significance of this structure. One is tempted at first
to suppose that it consists of moribund cells which have been shed from the
epithelium, but this view is rendered untenable by the fact that the shape of the
nuclei is different, being elongated and much more like that of the nuclei of the
connective tissue which underlies the epithelium. In fact the network looks as if it
were composed of extrusive connective tissue rather than of epithelial cells. As we
shall see presently, a somewhat similar network occurs in the tubules of the
paraphysis.
