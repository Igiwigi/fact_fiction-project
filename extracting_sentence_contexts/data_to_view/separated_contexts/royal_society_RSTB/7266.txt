Sections were usually
cut at 40 to 504. Thick sections have the great advantage over thin ones of rendering the
pattern of cell bodies and the course of their fibres relatively easy of reconstruction. It was,
in fact, found impossible in thinner sections to be sure of the identity of any one fibre within
a complex when attempting to trace its course from one section to another. Occasionally,
for the purpose of checking the reconstructions from 40 to 50 sections, blocks were cut
into 100, slices. This can be done on a Rocker microtome if a bunsen burner is placed close
to the block in order to soften it and so prevent cracking and curling of the wax.
