& This very interesting stage I was only able to examine from sections : the figures

§ The hind-brain (Meten., Epen.) has undergone comparatively little alteration, but
'& the mid- and fore-brains show a condition of things as nearly as possible intermediate
sp between Stage F and the adult.

‘= ‘The optencephals (Opten.) have become widely separated from one another by the
6 elongation of the optic commissure (opt.com.) or medio-dorsal portion of the mid-
brain; they have therefore come to occupy a lateral position as in ordinary birds (see
‘8 also Plate 12, fig. 143). At the same time the hemispheres (Prosen.) have grown
& backwards so as partly to cover the mid-brain. There is only wanted an increase in
3 size, and forward extension of the cerebellum to convert the brain of Apteryx at this
= stage into a typical avian encephal.

a VIIL—THE EYE.

(Plate 19, fig. 311.)

Ihave only a single fact to mention with regard to the eye, but that is one of
considerable interest. As Owxn showed, the pecten is absent in the adult, Apteryx
being in this respect unique among birds. But in advanced embryos of stages
H and I there is a distinct pecten in the form of a conical pigmented prominence,
about 1-2 mm. long, passing from the entrance of the optic nerve towards the back of
the lens.
