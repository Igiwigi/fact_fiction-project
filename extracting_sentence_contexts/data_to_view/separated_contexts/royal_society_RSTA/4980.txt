In this connection a suggestive result has recently been obtained by Mr. H. C. Pocktinaroy, ‘ Roy. Soe. Proe.,’ May, 1895, As the energy associated with a simple vortex ring in perfect fluid increases, its velocity
diminishes, so that a theory of gases in which the molecules are simple vortex rings fails to represent the
facts. In the previous paper (§ 87), a theory of simple vortex atoms in a rotational ether, with the appro-
priate molecular electric charges, was noticed. It is now found that the effect of the electrification may be
to reverse the above peculiarity, and, in particular, when the ring has nearly the configuration of minimum
energy for its given vorticity and given charge, the total energy varies very nearly as the square of its
velocity, that is as the temperature.
