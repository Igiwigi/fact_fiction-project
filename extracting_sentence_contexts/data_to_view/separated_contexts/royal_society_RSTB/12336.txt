For the purposes of LATL-housed concep-
tual combination, ‘twenty-three’ is in, but ‘two threes’ is out. The number studies taught us that for the LATL, what mat-
ters is the way a word contributes to the meaning of the whole,
as opposed to the inherent properties of the word itself. And, in
fact, it turns out that the word itself can be totally void of con-
ceptual features, as long as it can reference conceptual features
in the context, importing them into the combination. This was
shown by Zhang & Pylkkanen, who studied the functional
adjective ‘same’ and its ability to serve as an input item to
LATL composition [50,52]. If the LATL only took open class
conceptual items as input, same would probably not be able
to drive it, as it has no conceptual features of its own.
