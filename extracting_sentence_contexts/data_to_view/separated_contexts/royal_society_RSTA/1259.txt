Quantifying
dynamic cellular processes has been a major success for anomalous transport theory and much
scientific work is still ongoing [15-20]. However, current experimental studies [21-23] are finding
evidence of heterogeneous anomalous transport in intracellular processes while the theory for
heterogeneous anomalous transport (specifically when the fractional exponent yz is no longer a
constant) remains largely neglected. In fact, it is given knowledge that the cellular cytoplasm is a
vastly heterogeneous complex fluid [24]. In particular, organelles responsible for cellular metabolism and degradation called lysosomes
move predominantly subdiffusively with heterogeneous fractional exponents that depend on
their spatial positioning [21,25]. This implies that lysosome dynamics should be adequately
described by a fractional diffusion equation with a space-dependent fractional exponent, (x).
