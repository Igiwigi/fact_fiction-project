calculated values without, however, introducing material changes. The observed
magnetic variations have been treated as if they were wholly due to outside causes,
although it was shown in my previous communication that an appreciable portion of
it was an effect of electric currents induced inside the earth by the varying potential
itself. What we observe is the resultant of the original outside effect and its
concomitant induced inside effect. To explain the absence of time lag of the induced
variation it was necessary to assume a good conductivity of an inner core and small
conductivity of the outer shell. An estimate may be made of the radius of the
conducting core. If the outer potential is represented by Qr"a~", where a is the
radius of the earth, and the inner potential is «Qr~" a"?
obtained by the fact that if the inner conductivity is sufficiently great the vertical
force is entirely destroyed at the surface of the inner core. If this has a radius 7,

it follows that n7,"a" and (n+1)«7""a""’ must have equal values, or that
ne mrt (n+ 1) nth,

The resultant potential at the surface of the earth is, therefore,

\3n+1

n+1\a

If this expression is multiplied by n, we obtain the vertical force calculated from
