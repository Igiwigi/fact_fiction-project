I own that may be fatisfaQory in ſolving this admira-
ble appearance, as to deteCt the Errors of thoſe that have
offered at aſolution thereof, and have come ſhort (as T
conceive ) of being fatisfaQory.; that thereby I may a»
gain ſett the minds of Philoſophers on Work, and rouſe
them up to enquirea new after chis furprifing Phenomes
0n, That I may doe this the more EffeQtualy, I ſhall
breifly declare the Matter of Fa&t and then proceed to
the Reaſon thereof, given by ſeveral, and to their Confu-
tations. Firſt therefore it is well known that the mean appa-
rent Magnitude of the Moon is 30 ww. 3o/. we will take
it Numero Rotundo to de 30, that is, an Arch of a great
Circle in the Heavens of 30 Minuts'is covered by her Di-
ameter, and rhis we'll ſuppoſe to be her apparent Diame-
ter, at a full Moon in the midſt of Winter, and when
ſhe's in the Meridian, and at her greateſt Northern Lati-
tude and Conſequently the utmoſt that ſhe can beelevated
in our Horizn ; tisas well known alfo that when ſhe is
in this Poſture, being Looked upon by the Naked Eye
ſhe appears (that we may accomodate all to ſenſible Mea»
fares) tro be Magritudines Pedalis, about a foot broad. Bur the fame Moon being Looked upon juſt as ſhe riſes,
ſhe aypears to bs three or four foot broad, and yet if with:

they being as Various as are the Methods of raking the
Moons apparent Diameter, common enough amongſt the
Aſtronomers ; neither will I infiſt upon the truth of the
Matter of Fact, for that I think cannor. reaſonably be

Authors ſhould rack their Brajns for ſolving an appea-
rance, wherein they were not certain of the matter of FaQ,
* But becauſe of Nullius in Yerba, 1 can aſſert that T have ac-
curately tryed it my ſelfe, and I have fo found it: one of
thy ways I proceeded was thus, I took a very good Telc-
'= ſcope of about 6 foot long, in the inward Focus of whoſe
Eye-Glaſs I apply'd a very fine Lattice made of the ſingle
hairs of a Mans Head; then Looking with this at the
Moon when ſhe was juſt Riſcri and Looked Extraordina-
rily big, I obſerved whar Numbep of the ſquares of the
'S Lattice were Occupy'd by her body ; rhen obſerving her

more uſed, of raking her Diameter by, Mr. Tonzlys Micro-
meters : but I have alſotryed and found the ſame ching by *
an Accurate Sextant, taking the diftance of the Moons
Oppoſite Lunbs.
...Now' this Phevomen:n affords two, things to be con-
ſiderd, firſt why the Moon {1 {t.lI name the Moon as be-

thing holds in the Sun ) ſhould ſeem bigger a bout the
Horizon, then when more elevated; and ſecondly, ſhee

being taken, it is no greater then when ſhe appears lels,
