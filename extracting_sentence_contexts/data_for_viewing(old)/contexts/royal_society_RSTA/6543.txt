Mr. Davison’s interesting paper was, he says, suggested bya letter of mine published
in ‘ Nature’ on February 6, 1879. In that letter it is pointed out that the stratum of ©
the Earth where the.rate of cooling is most rapid lies some miles below the Earth’s
surface. Commenting on this, I wrote :— ;

“The Rey. O. FisHER very justly remarks that the more rapid contraction of the |
internal than the external strata would cause a wrinkling of the surface, although he
does not admit that this can be the sole cause of geological distortion. The fact that
the region of maximum rate of cooling is so near to the surface recalls the interesting
series of experiments recently made by M. Favre (‘ Nature,’ vol. 19, p. 108), where
all the phenomena of geological contortion were reproduced in a layer of clay placed
on a stretched india-rubber membrane, which was afterwards allowed to contract.
Does it not seem possible that Mr. Fisser may have under-estimated the contractibility
of rock in cooling, and that this is the sole cause of geological contortion ?”

Mr. Davison works out the suggestion, and gives precision to the general idea con- —
tained in the letter. He shows, however, that there is a layer of zero strain in the
