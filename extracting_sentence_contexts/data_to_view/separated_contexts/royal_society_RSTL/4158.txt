He has grounded this theory on some curious
experiments. For instance, by cutting in a longitudinal direction a stem of Medicago
sativa bent towards the light, he saw that the part of the stem which had been in
the light increased its curvature, while the other, on the contrary, became first
straight and then bent in an opposite direction. There was then, according to him,
an antagonism between the two slips, and this fact was sufficient to overthrow
DecanpoiLt's theory, in which, as the exterior slip is supposed to be the only active
one, its incuryation ought to have been preserved or even increased in the primitive
direction. I have repeated the same experiment with the same result on many stems
or footstalks, among others on the footstalk of the leaf of Calla wthiopica. But in
trying to repeat the sections in all directions, I observed that the bending of the
slips was always towards the bark, or outwards, and that the position of the stem
with regard to the light had nothing at all to do with it.
