A growing, highly fertile living population will have a and samples to undertake radiocarbon dating, there may
higher proportion of juveniles and we would expect the be some cases where the temporal scale is limited by the
deceased population to reflect this structure. As discussed ear- unavailability of large, sufficiently long-spanning radiocarbon
lier, juvenile to adult ratios developed by Bocquet-Appel & date datasets. Masset [17], Buikstra et al. [25] and Bocquet-Appel [18] Skeletally based palaeodemography may offer greater
(among others) sought to minimize the issues of age-estimation spatial and, in many cases, temporal specificity, permitting
error; however, the use of demarcations at 20 years of age and comparison between samples that are closely located (e.g.
30 years of age, respectively, still leaves a reasonable error range McFadden et al. [59]); however, the confidence of these con-
