account of the electrostatic attraction the charged atoms might be expected to have
greater difficulty in escaping from the metal. This would especially be the case at
low temperatures, and may account for the hydrogen set free from palladium not
being ionised. These considerations are also in agreement with the fact that
electrolytic hydrogen, which is positively charged, is capable of diffusing into some
metals—for instance iron—at ordinary temperatures. Experiments were also made to see how the positive ionisation in air varied with
the temperature, (1) when the tube had been heated for a long time in air and there
was no hydrogen inside the tube, (2) with a constant pressure (atmospheric) ot
hydrogen inside. The results, which extend from 973° C. to 1331° C., are exhibited in
