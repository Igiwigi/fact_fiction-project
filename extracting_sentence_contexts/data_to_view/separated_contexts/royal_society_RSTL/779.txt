This division, however, is entirely hypothetical, in so far as
the polarising forces is concerned, for it will afterwards be
shown that the phenomena of rock crystal may be explained
by a negative force emanating from two equal rectangular
axes, or that the phenomena of the other class. may be ex-
plained by a positive force in a similar manner ; or if we
prefer the analogies which the sciences of magnetism and

* The extreme difficulty which attends experiments of this kind, will be understood
from the fact, that I cut more than fifteen plates out of a large piece of zircon without
discovering its axis. By a singular accident, however, Mr. MozTon, jeweller, in
Edinburgh, procured for me no fewer than sixty plates of zircon with parallel faces,
and it was only in two of these that the system of rings was developed. Dr. BREWSTER 01 the'laws of polarisation, &c, 219

electricity present, we may explain the phenomena of both
classes, by supposing each crystal to be endowed both with
positive and negative axes,

In marking, therefore, this difference of action, I have em-
ployed the terms positive and negative, as denoting merely
the opposition, and not the nature of the polarising forces.
