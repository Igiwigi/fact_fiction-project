When the temperature gurrounding both is raised
to a prejudicial height the one will suffer more than the other, because equally inclement
conditions are brought to bear upon constitutions of different strengths ; and if the
temperature be sufficiently exalted or sufficiently prolonged to become fatal, the more
weakly organism will be the first to give way. A germ, moreover, brought close to the
death-point in a neutral or an alkaline infusion may revive, while in an acid one it
may perishâ€”just as proper nutriment may rescue a dying man while improper
nutriment would fail to do 80. These elementary considerations, founded on the
demonstrable fact that Bacteria-germs are more fully vivitied and better nourished in
neutral infusions than in acid ones, suffice, I think, to explain the observed difference
of action. At all events, these are the thoughts which have become rooted in my mind,
through long observation and long pondering of this question *.
