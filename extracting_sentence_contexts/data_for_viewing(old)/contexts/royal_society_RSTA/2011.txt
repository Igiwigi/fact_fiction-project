condemned without a fair inquiry into the evidence for and against its existence. A London
fog, like most disagreeable things and persons, may have its merits, and, doubtless, also
its firm partisans, who would be prepared to defend it in a general way before a Royal
Commission as a beneficial visitation. But the proofs of its utility, if they exist, must be
brought to light, and as yet we have had none. It may be upheld as a nebulous and
mysterious witticism, a gigantic piece of national humour, an enormous practical joke, and
we cannot dispute the plea that it may be a source of amusement to its passing acquaintance.
But those who know it well have had enough of it. It has hitherto been spared, because, like
other evils of greater magnitude, its ill effects have not been very startling and sudden, and
it was hard to believe that so harmless-looking and quiet a thing could do much mischief.
The unseen and little-noticed causes of death and disease, however, are by far the most
fatal. The small germ of typhoid or drain fever slays its thousands every year; but this
fact attracts less general attention than the drowning of five hundred by a collision or by a
flood. Yet of these the first is the most easily preventable evil. So we have been content to
pour the refuse from our domestic fires into the open air, and leave the work of scavenging
to unaided natural forces; to disregard ‘matter in the wrong place,’ so long as it has not
killed its hundreds or thousands at a time, and have tolerated something like suffocation,
so long as it performed its work slowly, made no unseemly disturbance, and took care
not to demand its hecatombs very suddenly and dramatically. And smoke in London has
continued probably for many years to shorten the lives of thousands, but only lately has the
sudden, palpable rise of the death-rate in an unusually dense and prolonged fog attracted
much attention to the depredations of this quiet and despised destroyer.
