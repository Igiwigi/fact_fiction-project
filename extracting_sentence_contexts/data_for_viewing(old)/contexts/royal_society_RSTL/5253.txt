sorbent tissue has its function finally suspended, and a new one substituted. In the
place of increasing at the cost of pre-existing tissue, growth is suspended, and it
unites with and assumes a similar office to that of the surrounding gum.

In conclusion, the authors may allude to an interesting fact, with reference to the
subject of absorption, which has been recently observed by Mr. STaxLey and subse-
quently by Mr. Bowman. In the treatment of ununited fracture, the practice has of
late been successfully adopted of drilling cylindrical holes into the bone in the neigh-
bourhood of the injury, and of driving in pegs of ivory, accurately fitted to the per-
forations, for the purpose of setting up action in their vicinity. These pegs, after
remaining in the bone several weeks, have been removed, and have been found on
inspection to present erosions similar to those which are seen on absorbing bone or
tooth, In fact, they closely resemble the fangs of temporary teeth recently attacked
by absorption. Mr. Bowman kindly placed at the disposal of the authors one of the
pegs which had been used for this purpose, a section of which presents, at the parts
eroded, in its microscopic characters, the usual emarginated outline s0 frequently
alluded to in the foregoing pages. They have not however had the opportunity of
investigating the condition of the tissues around the pegs; but it is exceedingly
probable that absorption has in these cases been effected by processes similar to those
which occur in the formation of Haversian spaces.
