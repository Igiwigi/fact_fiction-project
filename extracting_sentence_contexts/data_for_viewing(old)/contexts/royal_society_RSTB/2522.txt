Myopia is almost unknown in wild animals, but it occurs in wild specimens which

Haccket, in his ‘Systematic Phylogenesis,’t remarks that the organisation and
development of the eye in the vertebrates is, so far as their phylogenesis is concerned,
of very limited interest. With the material at his disposal he could not have come
to any other conclusion. Comparative ophthalmology is recent, and no attempt has

and of testing their taxonomic and phylogenetic value. I hope that the observations
