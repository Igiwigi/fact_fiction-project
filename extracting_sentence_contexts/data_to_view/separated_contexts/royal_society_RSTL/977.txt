This pedestal, though apparently a part of the branch, derives
a large portion of the matter, annually added to it, from the
cortical vessels of the principal stem ; and thence, in the event
of the death of the lateral branch, it always continues to live. But it not unfrequently happens, that a lateral branch forms
a very acute angle with the principal stem, and, in this case,

the bark between them becomes compressed and inactive ;
no pedestal is in consequence formed, and the attachment of
Such a branch to the stem becomes extremely feeble and in-
secure.** Instead of the reproduced buds of the preceding
experiment, buds were inserted in the foregoing swummer, or
attached by grafting in the spring ; and, when these succeeded,
though they were in many instances taken from trees of dif-
ferent species, and even of different genera, no sensible diffe-
rence existed in the vessels, which appeared to diverge into
the bark of the stock, from these buds and from those repro-
duced in the preceding experiments. It appears, therefore, probable, that a pulpous organisable
mass first derives its matter either from the bark, or the
alburnum ; and that this matter subsequently forms the new
layer of bark ; for, if the vessels had proceeded, as radicles,-
from the inserted buds, ar grafts, such vessels would have
been, in some degree, different from the natural vessels of the
bark of the stocks; and it does not appear probable, even
without referring to the preceding facts, that vessels should
be extended, in a few days, by parts successively added to their

* The advantages, which may be obtained by pruning timber trees judiciously,
appear to be very little known, I have endeayoured to ascertain the practicability of
giving to trees such forms as will render their timber more adyantageously conver-
tible to naval or other purposes. The $uccess of the experiments, on small trees has
been complete, and the revults perfectly consistent, in eyery case, with the theory I
have endeavoured to support in former memoirs ; and I am confident, that by appro-
priate management, the trunks and branches of growing trees may be moulded into
the various forms best adapted to the use of the $ship-builder; and that the growth of
the trees may at the same time be rendered considerably more rapid, without any
expense or temporary loss to the proprietor,

extremities, from the leaves to the extremities of the roots ;
which are, in many instances, more- than two hundred feet
distant from each other. - I am, therefore, inclined to believe,
that, as the preceding facts seem to! indicate, the matter,
which composes the new bark, acquires an organisation cal-
culated to transmit the true sap towards the roots, as that fluid
progressively descends from the leaves in the spring ; but
whether the matter, which enters into the composition of the
new bark, be derived from the bark-or the alburnum, in the
ordinary course of the growth of the tree, it will be extremely
difficult to ascertain.
