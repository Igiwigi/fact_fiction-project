The relaxation solution is given in figure 18. The chosen mesh has almost the largest
possible interval, not here because differences diverge at a larger interval, but because at
least two-sixth differences must be obtainable before decisions can be made regarding
the negligibility or otherwise of the difference correction. It was, in fact, negligible. For the
derivative equations at the boundary differences up to the fourth were retained, and the
subsequent correction for higher differences was very small. The remaining problem is the computation at boundary points of the non-zero principal

stress, given by ae
