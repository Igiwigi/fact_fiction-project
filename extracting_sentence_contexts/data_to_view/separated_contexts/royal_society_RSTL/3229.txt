Large fragments of rock
are scattered on most of the shelves, of which many are of granite, and have come from
a distance, as will presently be described ; the greater number, however, have merely
rolled down from the heights above. Of the latter, some have fallen recently, whilst
others are waterworn, as if they had lain for centuries on a sea coast ; and it was in
many cases easy to point out, whilst walking along the level shelf, which fragments
had been washed by the ancient waves, and which had fallen since. Sir Lauper Dick has observed, and the fact is very important, that the head of
Glen Gluoy is separated from the head of a branch of Glen Roy by a flat land-strait,
with which the shelf in the former glen is exactly on a level; s0 that if Glen Gluoy
were filled with water to the Full level of its shelf, or a few inches above it, besides a
great barrier at the lower end, a little mound, perhaps a foot or two in height, would
be required to prevent the water flowing into Glen Roy. In the same manner if Glen
Roy were closed at its lower end, and if water stood at the leyel of the apper shelf,
it would trickle into the valley of the Spey. The same thing would happen with the
lower $helf at the head of the valley of the Spean; and lastly, a short shelf, which I
discovered in a gully, which enters the Caledonian Canal near Kilfinnin4, between
