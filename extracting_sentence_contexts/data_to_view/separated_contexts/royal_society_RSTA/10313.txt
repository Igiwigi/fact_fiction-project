Now there is no molecule which
shows a greater tendency to form additive compounds than water. This property is
seen in the molecular species which contain water of crystallization. Brit has
investigated many other “unsaturated” properties of water and attributes them
to the quadri-valency of oxygen, but for our purpose all we need to recognise is
the fact that the water molecule tends to form molecular compounds. The part
played by the water in a gaseous action we can suppose as follows: The gaseous
substance which takes part in the action can unite with the water molecule directly
forming a molecular compound. This new complex molecule can then exist for some
time, during which its component atoms can re-arrange themselves, so that an internal
settling down to equilibrium takes place.
