P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. The interest of this condition lies in the fact that it is met with in all the higher
Primates from the Platyrrhine monkeys to man. In the human embryo, Dr. FLortan*
considers that it subserves two purposes: (1) it provides room for the free backward
growth of the tail-end of the embryo, and (2) it facilitates the rotation of the connecting
stalk from its original postero-dorsal position to its definitive attachment to the ventral
body-wall.
