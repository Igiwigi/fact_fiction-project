In view of the fact that the work was being
undertaken mainly with a view to the investigation of thunderstorms, it seemed
desirable that the sensitiveness should be so arranged that the deflection should
never be greater in two minutes than would bring the boom of the electrometer to
the edge of the paper on which the record was being made. This necessitated a
somewhat low sensitiveness, and, as a consequence, the electricity of rain with very
low charges could not be measured. There was the possibility of altering the
sensitiveness of the instrument according to the kind of rain which was expected,
but this was considered impracticable in view of the fact that the instrument could
not be watched continually, but had to be left to itself to take the records entirely
automatically. In reality, this difficulty was not serious. The conditions during
thunderstorms are entirely different from those during gentle rain, aud to investigate
the two cases is really a matter of two distinct researches.
