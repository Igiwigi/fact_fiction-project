The Coefficient of Viscosity of Mixed G'ases. The viscosity of mixed gases has been much studied, both theoretically and
experimentally. It is especially interesting on account of the curious fact, first
noticed by Granam (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1846), that the addition of a moderate amount of
light gas (hydrogen, in the case mentioned) to a much more viscous and heavy gas
(carbon dioxide) may actually increase the viscosity of the latter. The same
phenomenon was commented on by Maxwett in a Bakerian Lecture (1866), the
gases receiving particular mention being air and hydrogen.
