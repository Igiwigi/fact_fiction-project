This general criticism does not mean that after a complete survey of the nervous
structure of various members of the vertebrate phyla, greater understanding is not
possessed by the student, but it does imply that we know nothing about the cause or
influences which brought about the so-called change. Such a study does not offer any
solution of the problem why certain brains continue to develop past stages at which
others become permanently adult ; or why some remain embryonic longer ; or what
causes the varying degrees of energy manifested by their ability or non-ability to
maintain cell division over a greater span of time ; or what is the source of energy
behind their various characteristic forms of development. It is impossible to look at
a developing telencephalon of a frog, a reptile like Sphenodon, a lower mammal (such
as Platypus), and a higher one (such as man), and not be struck by what appears to
be an increasing liability of tissue, or by the evident fact that more cells proliferate.
But the impression so gained, as well as a knowledge of all the fibre tracts involved,
does not lead one to the cause of the differences in the dynamics of development.
Causation, or the factorial elements of phylogenetic or ontogenetic differentiation, is
hardly within the scope of inquiry by morphological studies. These considerations
should be kept in mind during the whole of the discussion, and especially during the
reading of that most intricate region of the corpus striatum, the amygdala.

This region was described for the first time in phylogenetic literature as an area of
definite delimitation, under the designation of the occipito-basal lobe by C. L, Herrick
(1891 and 1893) ; it is identical with the nucleus sphericus of ADOLF MEYER (1892),
with the epistriatum of Kapprrs (1908) and pe Lanen (1911), with the medial nucleus
