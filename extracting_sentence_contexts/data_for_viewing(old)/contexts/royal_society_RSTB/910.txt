10.—Some of the 12 cells on the deeper-lying chain are still extended. Others are rounded.
| .—Bacillus growing now where it has been unattacked. The chain which was attacked by
B cells appears quite dead, but the short chain projecting upwards has increased in length.
SLater.—Very vapid growth of bacilli. The chain attacked by the 12 cells, however, is completely
@pd. Of the other chain part was killed, and part which was exposed for only a short time to the

agiack of the eosinophile cells grew.
The growth of the bacilli was always determined by making a plan of the chains and numbering the

The fact that the bacilli are attacked at first exclusively by the eosinophile cells
as clearly shown in the following way :—About 0-2 cub. centim. of a fresh bouillon
Glture of anthrax was injected into the peritoneal cavity of a pithed Frog. When
By minutes had elapsed the cavity was opened and film preparations made, and
#ained with eosin and methylene-blue. On counting the cells in these preparations,
# was found that no less than 82 per cent. of the eosinophile cells were in contact
With bacilli. On the other hand, only 2°6 per cent. of the hyaline cells were even in
ntact with bacilli.
3 In a second experiment of a similar nature it was found that 42 per cent. of the
Gosinophile cells were in contact with bacilli, and only 2 per cent. of the hyaline cells.
The cells were counted with Oc. 10, Ob. 7y apochromatic oil immersion, by PowELL
nd Leananp.
