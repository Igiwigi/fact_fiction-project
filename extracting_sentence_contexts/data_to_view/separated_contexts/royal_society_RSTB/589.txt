The lateral ventricle is therefore an important landmark in this region, in distinguishing
the corpus callosum from its forceps major. The position of the forceps major in relation
to the lateral ventricle is always on its internal and inferior wall, while the tapetum is
on the external and superior, according as the section is horizontal or sagittal. At
the present level we can tell that the part of the corpus callosum now visible belongs
to the main body from the fact that it is superior to the lateral ventricle. On the
posterior and superior edge of the gyrus hippocampi there is a band of fibres whose
direction is parallel to the tapetum, from which it is separated by the ventricle ;
probably these are fibres of the forceps major. In the next section the corpus callosum has contracted to very small dimensions ;
the direction of its fibres is downwards and slightly forwards.
