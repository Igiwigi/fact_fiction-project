heat in Fluids, Experiment 17,) the results of which, no person,
to my knowledge, has yet explained,


observed on the Glacters of Chamouny, &c. 25

There is another very curious natural phenomenon, which I
could wish to see explained in a satisfactory manner, by those who
$till refuse their assent to the opinions I have been led to adopt,
respecting the manner in which heat is propagated in fluids.
The water at the bottoms of all deep lakes is constantly at the
same temperature, (that of qa* FAYHRENAEtT,) Summer and winter,
without any sensible variation. This fact alone appears to me to
be quite sufficient to prove, that if there be any immediate com-
munication of heat between neighbouring particles or molecules
of water, de proche en proche, or from one of them to the other;
that communication must be so extremely slow, that we may
with safety consider it as having no existence; and it is with
this limitation that I beg to be understood, when 1 speak of
fluids as being non-conductors of heat.

In treating of the propagation of heat in fluids, I have hitherto
confined myself to the investigation of the simple matter of fact,
without venturing to offer any conjectures relative to the causes
of the phenomena observed. But the results of recent experiments
