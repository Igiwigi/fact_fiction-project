from them. It would be simply monstrous to conclude that they had been © spon-
taneously generated.”

This reasoning applies word for word to the development of Bacteria from that floating
matter which the electric beam reveals in the air, and in the absence of which no Bac-
terial life has been generated. TI cannot see a flaw in the reasoning ; and it is 80 simple
as to render it unlikely that the notion of Bacterial life developed from dead dust can
ever gain currency among the members of the medical profession.

1t has been said of those whom the evidence adduced in favour of spontaneous genera-
tion fails to convince, that they seem willing to believe in almost any infringement of
natural uniformity rather than admit the doctrine*. This surely is an inversion of the
true order of the facts. Natural uniformity is the record of experience; and, apart
from the phenomena to be accounted for, there is not a vestige of experience, possessed
either by the man of science or the human race, which warrants the notion that dead
dust, and not living seed, is the source of the crops which spring from our infusions
after their impregnation by the floating particles of the atmosphere.
