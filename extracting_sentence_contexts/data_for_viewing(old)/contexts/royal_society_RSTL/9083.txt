Carine murivora (A. M.-Edw.)
(Plate XLI., Figs. A.â€”F.)

M. A. Milne-Edwards (Ann. Se. Nat. Zool. t. xix., art. 3, p. 12) recognized two
tibizz and one metatarsus as belonging to two species of Owls, one of which he
named Striz (Athene) murivora, the other (represented by one tibia only) he left
unnamed. This last was 6 mm. longer than that of C. murivora, and aid to be
distinguished by a shorter and less projecting peroneal erest. Having this individual
bone before us, together with a considerable numher of tibize of the shorter and
longer kind, we have been able to ascertain that a great portion of the peroneal eres
is broken away, that in perfect specimens the eres of the longer bones is as much
developed as in the shorter ones, and that, in fact, the former are evidently those of
females and the latter of males, according to the difference in size which obtains
between the sexes of nearly all the nocturnal birds of prey.

After having satisfied ourselves that all the Strigine remains from Rodriguez are
referable to one species only, Carine murivora, we hoped to be able, with the aid of
0 much more material than was at the disposal of M. Milne-Edwards, to throw
more light on its generic affinities. Tn this we were nob successful, chiefly for the
reason that the genera of Owls adopted by some ornithologists do not by any means
coincide with osteological modifications, and that the Rodriguez Owl shows a
combination of osteological characters which we have not found in any of the
numerous skeletons of Striges with which we have compared it (Bubo, Seops,
Surnia, Carine, Ninow, Glaucidium, A4sio, Fc.).
