Eulerian nutation,* with the additional feature that the axis of figure is displaced by
Gntrifugal force towards the axis of rotation. This latter fact has been assumed by
Sewcomst and other writers{ as the basis of their work. The law of displacement
& the pole of figure assumed by Newcos is, however, not verified. We find
