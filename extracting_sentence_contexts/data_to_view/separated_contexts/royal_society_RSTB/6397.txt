The fourth specimen, a piece of thin, black, wrinkled incrustation shown of natural
size in fig. 81, Plate 12, may be dealt with briefly. Its chief interest lies in its size
and isolation and in the fact that it gives some little idea of the form of a piece of
Nematothallus. It is over 6ยง cm. long by 1 cm. broad.
