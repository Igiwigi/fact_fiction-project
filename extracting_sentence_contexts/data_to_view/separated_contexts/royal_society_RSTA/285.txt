These and other
studies have been enhanced with the advent of combined diffuse correlation
and absorption spectroscopy techniques to provide a measure of relative changes
in blood flow as well as the usual oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin trend measures
24], and there was significant interest in the future applications and potentia
commercialization of diffuse correlation spectroscopy methods.

iii) Cytochrome c oxidase

In his 1977 Science paper, Jébsis makes clear his target for the initia
application of in vivo NIRS [30]: ‘Because of the physiological importance of this
enzyme (cytochrome c oxidase) and the favourable IR transmission characteristics
in this range, it appeared useful to attempt to observe the oxygen dependen
absorption peak in intact organs in vivo’. Since 1977, and as discussed a
the 1996 meeting, there has been much debate about the validity of oxCCO
measurements and in particular the choice of algorithms used for its derivation
[31]. In 2010, this marker of cellular oxygen metabolism is clearly still viewed
as having ‘physiological importance’, although the signal is not incorporated
into any clinical monitors and has in fact been removed from the latest three
generations of the NIRO systems produced by Hamamatsu Photonics. The
signal continues to be investigated in neurocritical care [32] and during cardiac
