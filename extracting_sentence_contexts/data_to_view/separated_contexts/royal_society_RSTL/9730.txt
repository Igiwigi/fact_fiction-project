The lines AB, A C, A D
are along ground which is practically level. At the commencement of the experiments
the ground was somewhat soft, and the ball at the first few blows sank to a considerable
depth. We may here call attention to the fact that the vibrations which we have investi-
gated, as in the case of vibrations produced in Mr. MALLer's experiments by an
explosion of gunpowder, are the result, of a disburbance produced on the surface of the
ground, whereas in actual earthquake motion it is quite possible that the disturbances
we feel may have an origin which is deeply seated beneath the 8uperficial crust. The
only advantage which we can claim for our method of producing vibrations, as com-
