New tools have recently
emerged to deal with the very large numbers of sequences
of SARS-CoV-2 genomes [100,101] which are likely to provide
inspiration for how to improve the future scalability of
bacterial genome analysis. Perhaps even more importantly, a counterintuitive advan-
tage of the step-by-step approach is that it is less automatic
than the integrated approach. Although this may seem like
a disadvantage, the fact that several software tools have to
be applied one after the other brings great benefits. It
allows the user to check after each step that the result
makes sense before carrying out the next step. For example,
if a phylogeny is clearly wrong due to contamination
during sequencing, there is no point trying to apply dating
of the nodes or interpreting the phylogeny in terms of epide-
miology.
