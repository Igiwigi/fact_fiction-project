he made little attempt to attract management interest, since, as he explained, he
was there to help theoretical understanding, not to invent devices. RCA made no
attempt to invalidate the patent or to claim ownership, possibly because there
were further legal complications (Kawamoto 2002).

James Fergason was a scientist who had worked on cholesteric LCs at
Westinghouse in the early 1960s, but left in 1966 to join Kent State University.
Two years later he formed his own company, ILIXCO, to manufacture LC
displays. In 1968 and 1970 he published two papers that effectively contained
descriptions of the TN display (Arora et al. 1968; Fergason et al. 1970). He
made no attempt then to patent the concept, and was surprised, and probably
irritated, when a colleague reported back after a visit to H-LR that Schadt and
Helfrich had invented a new form of LCD. In fact, it was as a result of this
inadvertent disclosure that H-LR had rapidly taken the patenting and publishing
actions. Fergason himself set about composing patents and, after an abortive
attempt in February, submitted in April a patent, which was granted in 1973
(Fergason 1971). No mention was made in this patent of his earlier publications.
Though the validity of Fergasonâ€™s patent could have been queried because of
those disclosures, there could be no doubt that he had made and shown a device
in April 1970, because he had recorded the invention in witnessed notebooks. He
