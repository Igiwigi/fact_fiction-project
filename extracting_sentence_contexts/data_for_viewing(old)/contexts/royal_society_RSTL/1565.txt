parallel of N. lat. g49, it is evident that he did not, in any part
of his course ( and much less, at the commencement of it), come
within a considerable distance of the moon's umbra.

I much doubt whether, according to our present computa=-
tion, this eclipse was total even at Tripoli: and, although it
was unquestionably of considerable magnitude, both there and
as far north as Syracuse itself, yet (for the reasons already
given in this paper) I do not think that, at any intermediate
place between these two cities, it could be so great as to pro-
duce that degree of obscurity, which is recorded by Dioporus
and confirmed by JusTiN. In order that the phenomenon
Should accord with the fact, as related by these historians, the
centre of the moon's shadow ought to pass over, or very near
to, Malta: that is, the latitude of the moon ought to be, at
least, three degxees greater than our present tables make it.

Since the latitude of the moon depends on her true distance
from the node, these observations (if correct) will show the
necessity of some alteration in the table of the secular variation
of the moon's mean distance from her node, which (agreeably
to the rule given by M. LaeLact) is deduced immediately
from the secular variation of her mean longitude. These re-

anarks, however, are thrown out merely as hints to those who
