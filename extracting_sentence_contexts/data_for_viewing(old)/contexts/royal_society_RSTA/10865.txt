The minor earthquakes are local, and more probably due to the changes beneath
the voleano before an outburst takes place. It is significant in this respect that on
July 9th, though there was no discharge from the crater of the Soufriére, that
mountain showed its sympathy with the eruption in Martinique by means of strong
earthquake shocks.

No earthquakes of great violence have been experienced this year in Martinique,
St. Vincent, and St. Lucia, though small shocks were frequent. In Trinidad the
Milne seismograph in the Botanic Gardens has shown none but small disturbances.*

In Montserrat, since the year 1896, earthquakes have been very frequent; in
fact, it is said that they have been of almost daily occurrence, and in some cases as
many as 100 have been counted in one day.t

It is apparently a matter of indifference which of the volcanoes of the chain is in
operation ; one appears to be able to function in place of the others. The previous
eruptions of the Soufriére and Montagne Pelée did not coincide in point of time, and
that both have this year been in violent action further proves the unusual magnitude
of the changes in progress in that part of the earth’s crust.

Nowhere along the Caribbean islands have changes of level been proved to have
taken place upon the coasts. Sensational paragraphs have been published regarding
alterations in the soundings, ‘but they are probably unreliable. The frequent
ruptures of the submarine cables, however, are sufficient to prove that there has
