pelvic muscles and the pericardium, and so far as I have been able to ascertain, form the
only open and direct connection between the sub-thyroid sinus and the great lymph
reservoirs situated at the base of the skull through which the chief constituents of the
lymphatic system as a whole communicate with the jugular vein. But from the back-
ward trend of these communicating channels it seems unlikely that the lymph in the
ventral system passes along them to any extent towards the pectoral sinus ; it seems,

‘in fact, more probable that the flow would be in the opposite direction (as in other
tributaries of the ventral system) from the aida around the pectoro-pelvic articulation
towards the sub-thyroid sinus.

Tn any case there is, I think, no question that the flow of lymph in the ventral system
