+ In Montebrasite (formerly Amblygonite), State of Maine, one has, on the contrary, g<v on either side of
the acute bisector ; 80 that this oppoite character in the proper dispersion of the optic axes would snffice to
distinguish Amblygonite from Montebrasite, since it forms a distinctive character of the highest importance in
erystallized substances, and scems to be the most constant of all their properties as optically birefringent
snbstances. Tn fact there is no example of a single well-defined species of a natural or artificial product
presenting in different specimens optic axes with opposite dispersions, provided that these axes are situated in
the same plane ; and this is true whateyer may be the variations in their physical and chemical characters. It is only when the hxes pass from one plane into a cond perpendicular to it, as happens in orthose,
heulandite, and other minerals, that any change takes place in the relative positions of the axes corresponding
to the red rays with regard to the axes which correspond to the blue. + Under the same cireumstances Montebrasite of Hebron and Montebras presents a horizontal dispersion in
combination with a well-marked inclined dispersion.
