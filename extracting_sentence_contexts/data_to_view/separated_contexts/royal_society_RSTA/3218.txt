A particularly fascinating scenario would arise if the Higgs boson mass happened to lie close
to the value that corresponds to an exactly flat interaction potential. Then the UV theory has
to guarantee such an exceptional matching condition at the high scale. In fact, asymptotically
safe gravity had been suggested for such a scenario already before the discovery of the Higgs
boson [54]; see also [55]. Purely within particle field theory, such a scenario would be most natural
in theories where also the Higgs sector becomes asymptotically freeâ€”a long-standing idea that
currently witnesses new attraction [56-60]. Data accessibility.
