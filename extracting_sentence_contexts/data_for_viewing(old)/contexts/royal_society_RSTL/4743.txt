Mahabnleshwar and Mercara there is a gradual decrement of heat from the maximum
point until the month of October, when the mean monthly temperature rises at both
places, but falls after that month to the minimum of the year. The same thing occurs
in Bombay and Poona, but there is no rise in October at Madras nor at Calcntta in
1846 or 1847; and in 1845 and 1848, when the gradual decrement of heat was in-
terrupted, it occurred in September instead of October, as at the other places within
the influence of the same monsoon. At Uttray Mullay and Dodabetta, within the
influence of both monsoons, we find the annual curve of temperature interrupted
in the first place in March, then in July, October and November in 1845, and in July,
August and September in 1846. At Dodabetta the increase is quite gradual from De-
cember to May ; but the natural decrement is interrupted in July, and the tempera-
ture rises in August, sinks in September, rises in October, and then falls to the mini-
mum of the year. From these facts, it appears that the two mons00ns derange the

Unless where hourly observations are taken, the exact periods of the occurrence of
