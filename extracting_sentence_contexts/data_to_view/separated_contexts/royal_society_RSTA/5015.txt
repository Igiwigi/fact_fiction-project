where a is the crack length, 1 is the strain hardening exponent, T is the effective flow stress of
the material and the other symbols have their usual meaning. In fact, T is frequently regarded
as a fitting parameter. This equation shows, in qualitative agreement with linear elastic fracture
mechanics crack growth correlations, that for a given plastic strain the FCP rate increases with
Ao. On the other hand, for deformation by Orowan looping (figure 7b), there is a plethora of
literature which shows that crack initiation for disbursed slip is more difficult and the initiation
life should be longer.
