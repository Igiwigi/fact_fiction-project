They are here too in the plane of the dip, or nearly
80; 8ince in all situations they direct themselves to a point that appears up-
wards of 15* 8outh of the zenith. Will it not now be admitted as proved by the above observations, and their
extensive verifications by 80 many different persons,â€”that the aurora borealis
always presents itself in definite and very curious relations, to the lines of
magnetism, indicated by the needle. That the streamers, in the direction of their length, coincide with the plane
of the dip of the needle, or nearly s0; and that each individual streamer is, in
fact, parallel to the dipping needle. That they form a thin fringe, stretching often a great way from E. to W. at
right angles to the magnetic meridian. That the fringe moves away from the N. magnetic pole, by the extinction of
streamers at its northern face, and the formation of new ones contiguous to its
southern face.
