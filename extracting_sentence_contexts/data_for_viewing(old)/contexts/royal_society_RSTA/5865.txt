Then, the so-called optimal control u* is determined as the minimizer of a given cost functional

u* =arg min I(x’, u), (2.13)

subject to the constraint (2.12). In (2.13), the minimum is taken on the set U of all admissible
controls. A classical choice for 7 is a quadratic cost functional of the form

Idx’, uw) = FE[(x’ — xpi? + vu?] iec, (2.14)

v > 0 being a penalization coefficient measuring the economic and social cost of the control and
x7, >0 the desired target number of social contacts for the compartment i¢C. According to
(2.14), the cost of the control increases quadratically with the distance to the desired target of
average number of contacts. The presence in (2.14) of the mean operator is related to the fact
that, by hypothesis, a control cannot act on the random fluctuations introduced to mimic the
unanticipated daily interactions among agents. Let us observe that other convex cost functionals
may be considered as well. However, they often lead to problems whose analytical solution
cannot be obtained explicitly. Proceeding now as in [30], the control introduced in (2.12) can be
solved explicitly giving

which generates the optimal constrained law of growth of the social contacts

Now, in the presence of the above described microscopic controlled interactions, one can
