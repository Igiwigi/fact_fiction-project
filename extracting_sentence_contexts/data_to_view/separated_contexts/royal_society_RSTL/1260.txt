Geologists are generally agreed, that the greater number
of the crystalline mineral substances must have been pre-
viously in a liquid state ; but different schools have supposed |
different causes for their solution ; some attributing this effect
principally to the agency of water, others to that of heat.

When, however, it is considered, that the solvent power
of water depends upon its temperature, and its deposition of
solid matters upon its change of state or of temperature ; and
that being a gravitating substance, the same quantity must
always belong to the globe, it becomes difficult to allow much
weight to the arguments of the Wernerians or Neptunists,
who have generally neglected, in their speculations, the laws
of chemical attraction. There are many circumstances, on the contrary, favour-
able to that part of the views of the Huttonians or Plutonists,
relating to the cause of crystallization ; such as the form of
the earth, that of an oblate spheroid flattened at the poles ;
the facility with which heat, being a radiating substance, may
be lost and dissipated in free space ; and the observations
which seem to show the present existence of a high tempera-
ture in the interior of the globe. I have often, in the course of my chemical researches, looked
for facts or experiments, which might throw some light on
this interesting subject, but without success, till about three
years ago; when, in considering the state of the fluid and
acriform matters included in certain crystals, it appeared to
me, that these curious phenomena might be examined in a
manner to afford some important arguments as to the causes
of the formation of the crystal. It is well known that water, and all fluids at usual tem-
peratures, are more expansible by heat than siliceous or other
earthy matters ; and supposing these crystals to have been
formed, and the water or fluid inclosed in them, at a pressure
and temperature not very unlike those of our existing atmo-
sphere, this fluid ought to fill nearly the same space as when

included, and the elastic fluid confined with it, supposing it
non-absorbable, ought to be in the same state of density. On
the contrary, if the earthy matter and the fluid separated
from each other under a much higher temperature than that
now belonging to the surface, a certain vacuum might be ex-
pected in the cavity from the contraction of the fluid, and if
any gas were present, a considerable rarefaction of it; and
though, supposing a much higher temperature on the surface
of the globe, the atmosphere formed by aqueous vapour must
have had much greater absolute weight, which, as liquids
are compresstble, must have influenced the volume of the
fAuid at the time it was inclosed, a circumstance which would
render it impossible to draw any conclusion as to the exact
temperature, yet still the experiments appeared to offer, on
any view, interesting results; and I was the more desirous
of performing them, as I believe the nature of the fluid and
aeriform matters included in rock crystals and other siliceous
stones, has never been accurately ascertained,

Having purchased 8ome erystals, and having had others
committed to my care by the liberality of my Brother Trustees
of the British Museum, and of my friend Professor BuckLanp,
I proceeded to make the necessary experiments upon them.
