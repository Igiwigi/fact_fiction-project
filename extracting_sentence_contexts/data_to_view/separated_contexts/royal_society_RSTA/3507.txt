The decrease in concentration of hydrogen atoms available to precipitate can explain the
difference in energy between dissolution and precipitation after a thermal cycling for a global
approach. Moreover, the accumulated effect of multiple misfit dislocations depinning after a large
number of cycles can lead to the precipitation of hydrogen-poor hydride phases. In fact, the
simultaneous presence of the initial hydrogen-rich phase (the FCC d-hydride) and a hydrogen-
poor phase (the y-FCT) was observed at the hydride-substrate interface after cycling, as shown
in figure 3. The re-precipitation of the 5-hydride after 20 thermal cycles is still highly coherent
