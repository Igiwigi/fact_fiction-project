In order to do this I divided y or 69° 49’ by 12, and took 5° 49/545 as the common
difference, say 6, I then computed sec x, a + b cot? x + ¢ cot'y +..., and
see x + (a + b cot? x + ¢ cot'y...) * for values of p= 0, 8, 28,+.. 128 or y. As a fact the first five or six values need not be computed because the early values
of the functions to be integrated are practically zero. The ordinary formule of

quadratures are inappropriate for these integrations, because the function, say U,, to
be integrated increases so very rapidly.
