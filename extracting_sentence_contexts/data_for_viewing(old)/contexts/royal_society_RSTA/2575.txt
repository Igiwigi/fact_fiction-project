ashamed to acknowledge and discuss mistakes, not just their own mistakes, but even mistakes in
the published work of others. They are especially reluctant to mention to their students that even
the classics made scores of mistakes.

However, anyone acquainted with the history of Mathematics, and anyone familiar with the
current state of affairs, is fully aware that mathematical works are swarming with mistakes of
all possible sorts. Of course, one should distinguish these mistakes by how critical they are, how ia
serious they are, and especially, by their aetiology. De

As everyone knows, there are trivial mistakes, of computational nature. Before the advent im
of computers, such mistakes were extremely difficult to detect. Fortunately, proofs of serious a
mathematical results rarely depend on the details of calculations. On the other hand, there are [8
much more dramatic deep mistakes, related to the fact that we do not appreciate some essential :
aspects of the situation. Also, in many cases, irreparable mistakes are produced by incorrect use
of preceding results.

It seems that physicists, and some other scientists have a much healthier attitude. As Walter
Rudin puts it in his autobiography ([5], Misteaks): ‘Mathematicians are human. Humans make
mistakes. This is no cause for alarm.’ Or, as Richard Feynman observed: ‘It is our responsibility
as scientists to teach how doubt is not to be feared, but welcomed and discussed’. Below I give a
very scant sample of such historical mistakes of different sorts, just to illustrate my point.

e It seems that none of the geometric proofs in the first books of Euclid, which are even
today merchandized as proofs in school Geometry textbooks, are proofs according to the
modern standards. Apart from the stated axioms, these ‘proofs’ refer to scores of unstated
