the most advanced condition under which it is known to exist in the Echinodermal
series, The proportion between these two systems, when they exist together in the
same individual, is thus shown to be inverse. The fluid contained in the © water-
vascular” system and peritoneal cavity of the Echinoderms is described both by
TizDEMANN and SHARPEY® as consisting of pure unorganized sea-water. In his Mo-
nograph on this class, MoLLEr avowedly adopts the same view. Analogy and
demonstration will now be shown to be opposed to this opinion.

The peritoneal cavity exists in aLL Echinoderms. In air species this Space is
occupied by a fluid; in ALL sPEclts, including the Ophiocomide and Ophiuride,
this fluid penetrates through hollow axes, into the arms and lobes, and air the
membranous processes of the tegumentary system. In aL Echinoderms the 1xTEROR
of the stomach and its dependent cw&ca are lined with vibratile epithelium. This fact
establishes a connection between the Echinoderm and the Medusz, the gastro-
vascular canals of which were proved to be similarly ciliated, whilst it disjoins them
in a striking manner from the Entozoa and Annelida, digestive organs of which, as
will be afterwards proved, are never furnished with vibratile epithelium. The
boundaries of the peritoneal cavity are universally ciliated. A the integumentary
membranous processes are lined within and without with ciliary epithelium, and con-
sist of hollow prolongations of the peritoneal cavity. In Asterias rubens, the cuta-
neous membranous processes are readily distended by injection thrown into the
peritoneal cavity. Thus injected they rise, in relief, to a considerable distance aboye
the plane of the integumentary surface.

They are ceacal at their distal ends. This fact is absolute throughout the Echino-
