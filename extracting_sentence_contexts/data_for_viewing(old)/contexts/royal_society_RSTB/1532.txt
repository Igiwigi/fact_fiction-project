stimulus placed on the posterior external column, the more did the tail move to

- that side.

Similarly with regard to the lateral extent of the areas mentioned above, whereas
of course a strong stimulus caused movement in all the parts named, nevertheless in
each case it was quite definite that the area for the tail was nearer the middle line
than that for the hamstrings, the area for the hamstrings nearer the middle line than
that for flexion of the hip, and this median of that area stimulation of which caused
lateral flexion of the side. That the posterior fibres as they ascend in the cord are
placed nearer the middle line than those entering the cord higher up, and so on, of
course, is now well known anatomically, but the arrangement has not hitherto been
demonstrated functionally, nor the fact that stimulation of certain paths or areas in
the posterior external column gives definite movements in definite parts. These areas
seem quite constant, and, of course, overlap one another in their vertical, if not in their
lateral extent. That this is so would, of course, be anticipated from consideration of
