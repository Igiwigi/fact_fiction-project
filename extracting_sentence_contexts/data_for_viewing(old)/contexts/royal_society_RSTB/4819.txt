If the duct system of the antennal gland, apart from the end sac, is compared with
the labral glands, there are seen to be some very marked morphological similarities.
The labral glands of Estheria show the same arrangement as those of Chirocephalus
that have been briefly described by the author (5). There are three conspicuous glands,
each consisting of a pair of gland cells between which is a reservoir of secretion and a
tubular duct cell leading from the reservoir to the exterior. One of the glands opens
medianly and the others laterally.

The duct cell of the labral gland may be taken as corresponding to the proximal
duct cell of the antennal gland. The two gland cells would then correspond to the
two distal duct cells of the antennal gland. Such a comparison is supported by the
fact that fluid of some sort does accumulate between the two distal duct cells, just as
the secretion of the labral gland accumulates in a reservoir between its two gland cells.
Further, the cytoplasm of the labral gland cells is filled with dark-staining rodlike
bodies, just as are the distal duct cells of the antennal gland, although in the former
case they are not arranged in any special manner as they are in the latter.

If it is allowed that this morphological similarity may have some homological
significance, it appears to the writer possible to suggest a rational explanation of the
two distinct types of excretory glands that occur in Estheria and in Crustacea generally.
Tt can be taken either that the Crustacea are evolved from a form in which there was in
each segment a pair of ccelomic sacs with their ccelomiducts and a pair of true ectodermal
nephridia opening into them and acting as the excretory organs, or else that there were
no true nephridia and the coelomiducts functioned as the excretory ducts, as is the case
