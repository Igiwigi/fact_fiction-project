The statistics he
offers indicate that such may be found to be the case, and that feeding the mother
with lecithin may result in the birth of a very marked excess of females. But what
looks at first sight to be clear proof of this is found to be open to grave suspicion,
for the instances he makes use of, both in his original paper (1907 A) and in a further
one (1907 B) dealing with the same subject, appear to be selected cases, and it is
impossible to be assured they are truly representative (confer BATESON, 1908). But however this may b√© from a sex point of view, the fact remains that he
shows a variable power of assimilation among ovarian oya. Regarding the relative power of vitality of the sexes, it is true that, so far as our
present knowledge actually shows, there is no surety that fertilised ova of either sex
are specially subject to death in their early stages of development. For this reason
it may be claimed that the premature death of embryos while in the egg does not
appreciably affect the ratio of the sexes produced by any animal.
