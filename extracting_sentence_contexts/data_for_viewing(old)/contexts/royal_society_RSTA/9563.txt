been taken for the determination of n, a higher value would have been obtained and
the error in the use of the index law at the highest velocities would have been much
less. In order to show the manner of variation of » throughout the whole range of
velocities obtained, the values of n have been determined by the Reynolds method
at four different stages and are as follows :—

Velocity in centimetres per second . . . 58. 258. 900. 2250.
Value of n from plotting . . . . .°. 172 177 1°82 1°92,

Similar results showing a gradual increase in the value of 7 as the velocity increases
have been obtained by the reduction of the observations for the 0°7125 and 1°255 em.
pipes, and it may therefore be taken as fully demonstrated that an index law for
surface friction cannot be devised which will express the facts with any accuracy,
except over a comparatively small range in the value of vd/v. It will be obvious that
this factor must be borne in mind in predicting the skin friction of large bodies
moving in a fluid from observations on small-scale models moved in the same fluid.

The Comparison of the Results with those of Previous Experimenters.

As the method of representing the results of the surface friction experiments
described in this paper is somewhat novel, it has been considered advisable to reduce
the observations of some well-known previous experimenters, in a similar manner, and
to plot them all on the same diagram for the purpose of comparison. Taking only
experiments on pipes whose roughness was comparable with the ones used by the
authors, those chosen for reduction are as follows :—
