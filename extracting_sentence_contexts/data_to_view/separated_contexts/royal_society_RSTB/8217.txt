Compared with low-

individual is exposed. level after-effects, adaptation to faces shows substan-
tial transfer across changes in size and location
4. DYNAMICS OF FACE ADAPTATION [14,16,41-43]. In fact, these size changes are often

included as a control to reduce the contribution of
early retinotopic response changes. However, the
strongest after-effects persist when the adapt and test
faces give rise to the same proximal stimulus (i.e. the
same retinal image) [44,45]. The broad but in-
complete transfer of the adaptation across spatial
transformations is consistent with the larger receptive
fields and spatial tolerances characterizing extrastriate
areas implicated in face perception like the fusiform
face area (FFA) [46].
