sponding ramifications of the Haversian canals in the subjacent bone.

By studying the structure of the above scale, along with that existing in Cycloid
and Ctenoid scales, we are enabled to comprehend what was previously obscure, viz.
that of the scale of Macropoma Mantelli from the Chalk. It is now obvious that the
vertical section figured in my last memoir{ reveals a structure which is identical with
that of a cycloid fish; only in the process of fossilization, the lowest or membranous
layer has disappeared, leaving the calcareous laminze of the middle layer, as seen near
the margin of one of these recent scales. But in the WMacropoma, instead of being
merely covered with a layer of what I have regarded as ganoin, as in the Carp, Perch,
&e., this tissue is $urmonnted by an abundant development of kosmine, in the form
of large pointed teeth h, which closely resemble those of the Silaroid fish just de-
scribed. They differ little in the two cases, beyond the fact, that whilst in the Silu-
roid the teeth haye contracted bases and are moveable, in the Macropoma these bases
are expanded, and firmly fixed upon the upper surface of the scale, We thus see how

* Some similar teeth have been described and figured by M. Acazs1z, as existing on the scale of Hypo-
tome placostomus, Poissons Fosiles, vol. i. tab. H. fig. 31 and 32. He peaks of their constricted bases and
the cireular holes into which they are fitted, but refers to the latter as existing in the enamel (6mail). In
the present scale we have no 8uch substance; it is entirely composed of true os8eous tissue ; the details of the
structure upon which the teeth are fixed are not shown in a yery definite manner in the figures.

+ Their continuity does not happen to be shown in the specimen from which the above figure was drawn.
