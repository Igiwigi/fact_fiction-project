We will discuss in the following sections the role of
CO, utilization in this general panorama. Globalization of chemical production is a major element characterizing the current landscape,
but there are several indications of how moving to a de-globalization will characterize the
future of chemical production. In fact, widening the type of raw materials, with emphasis on
local resources (due to various economic and social pushes), will determine a move towards
de-globalization and tighter integration with other industrial sectors (symbiosis, synergy, etc.),
as already observed in some cases. This will determine different regional ‘pressures’ to use
alternative raw materials. In regions such as Europe that lack other resources, CO? (re)use will
play a major role in maintaining competiveness and in moving to a low-carbon economy [31-34].
