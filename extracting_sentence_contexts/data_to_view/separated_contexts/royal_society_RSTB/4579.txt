normally “triadic” portions of the areas is also worthy of comment. Although
lapses from perfection might be naturally expected in so elaborate and congested a
structure, the fact remains that no such irregularity occurs in those Echinoids whose
complexity approximates to that of D. cylindrica.’ It seems explicable only as an
expression of the morphogenetic instability which might be associated with transition
from one stage of complexity to another, but that other is plainly not an Holectypoid
type. The foregoing considerations may be summarised in the following diagram, which,
it may be well to repeat, is not intended to represent true phyletic connections,
although these are probably indicated approximately :—
