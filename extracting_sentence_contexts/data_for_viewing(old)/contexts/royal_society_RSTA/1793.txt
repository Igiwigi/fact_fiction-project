It seems then that these two methods, Stehfest and pole extraction, are complementary and can
be used in the short- and long-time domains, respectively. The point of transition that we have
established empirically, after many simulations, for a system of tubes of the same material is the
time defined by fin = wouro b?, where b stands for the total thickness of the tubes.

From figure 4, it is evident that the logarithmic signal curve is steep in the case of the stainless
steel due to its smaller relative magnetic permeability and hence to the weaker eddy currents
induced in the tube wall. This is exactly the expected behaviour [3,6,19].

In the summation of (2.2), we have used 50 terms, and for the Laplace inversion, we only use
1 pole per eigenvalue (hence 50 poles). The boundary of the truncated domain is set to h = 100rzr
for carbon and h =20rzr for stainless steel. The fact that we use only 1 pole for each eigenvalue
is a crude computation that nevertheless gives good results for the long time. For the long-time
domain, the number of eigenvalues and thus the number of poles can be decreased further. We
have run a parametric study regarding the number of poles that can be used to reliably compute
the induced voltage. Figure 5 shows results that compare pole extraction method (with decreasing
number of poles) to the exact NILT solution. It is clear that the limiting case of using just 1 pole
can also be used for a reliable representation in the long-time region.

In this case, the induced voltage is computed by only the first term of (3.2), which for the cases
of the carbon (CS) and stainless steel (SS) tubes and the data in table 1 reduces to:

VE5(b) = 0.0032e~7357! > logs) VRe(t) = —2.49 — 10.4t,
VE (t) = 14.717 69! — log, V(t) = 1.17 — 2691. (4.1)
