content (table 1) [14]. This last point appears to be confirmed by results obtained in zircaloy-4
(0.8 at% in Ocq), where the hydrogen content has negligible effect on the activation volume [44].
All these results are unaffected by different stress orientations despite the crystallographic texture
[47]. Thus, the role of hydrogen is similar on (a) and (c + a) slip systems (table 1).
All the features just discussed seem to be associated directly with the presence of oxygen and
its effect on screw dislocation mobility; therefore, the common explanation given for the impact
of hydrogen in terms of elastic shielding effect cannot be possible in Ti-« and Zr-« alloys [48-50].
Despite this, in situ TEM observations under hydrogen pressure highlight an increase in screw
dislocation mobility with hydrogen content in Ti-« [51]. Using ab initio calculations based on
density functional theory, Domain et al. have studied the interaction of hydrogen with stacking
faults in the Zr-H solid solution. Hydrogen seems to reduce stacking fault energies, which favours
the spreading of the dislocation core in the prismatic plane and consequently hinders cross-slip
[46]. In fact, there are no experimental results to confirm these observations and the interactions
