There is some evidence, however, that the
colony in question was taken near the end of the sexual breeding season, with a few
zooids entering the asexual phase. The zooids are smaller and the colony more pedunculate than Diazona and the
relationship with the synoicids even more pronounced. In fact, the zooids resemble
those of the synoicids in the presence of a true post-abdomen containing heart and
gonads. Formation of budsâ€”The great majority of zooids in the colony are breeding
individuals, but a few are evidently in the throes of budding. As in Diazona, there
is a disintegration of the anterior part of the zooid and a concentration of food-laden
cells posteriorly.
