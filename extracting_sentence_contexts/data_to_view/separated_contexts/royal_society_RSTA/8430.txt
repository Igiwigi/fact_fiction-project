It may be that the decreasing convergency shown by
our present solution as / increases is a preliminary indication of the critical nature of the
steady motion.

6. The Resistance of a Flat Plate along the Stream (Skin Friction). The problem of finding the motion of fluid about a plane in the direction of the
undisturbed stream admits of solution by a variation of method ; it is in fact a somewhat

simpler problem than that of the circular cylinder. It is convenient to regard the
problem as one in which the fluid is at rest at infinity and
the plate is then moving in its own plane. The plate is taken as lying in the plane woz and of
infinite length in the direction of the z axis.
