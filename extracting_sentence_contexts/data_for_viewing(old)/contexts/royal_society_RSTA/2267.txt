mechanics (Navier-Stokes and generalizations thereof).

The DSFD approach shines most intensely whenever continuum PDE models
do not exist, are theoretically unviable, or just very hard to solve on a computer,
typical examples in point being multi-phase/multi-component flows, with highly
space-time-dependent interfaces, and flows in complex geometries. The various
advantages of the DSFD approach have been widely emphasized in the literature,
and need not be revisited here.

Rather, as approaches to the discrete simulation of fluid now enter a
vigorous maturity, we believe that a new synthesis best describes their place
in computational fluid dynamics. Despite their many merits, discrete simulation
methods are obviously not a panacea. In fact, many notions and concepts from

PDE discretization have proven extremely valuable in boosting their quality
and overall performance, a statement that is particularly true for the widely
popular Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, de facto a powerful blend of particle
and grid methods.
