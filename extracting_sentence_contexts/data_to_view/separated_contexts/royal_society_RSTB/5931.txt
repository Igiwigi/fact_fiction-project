According to his claims, X-ray examination showed a reduction in the thickness of the
periodontal membrane, and the gingival tissues rapidly became healthy again. He
leaves it open whether the action of the orange juice is due to its vitamin C or to some
other unspecified constituent. Now it is generally accepted by students of nutrition that many sections of the com-
munity, living on diets containing little or no fresh fruit and green vegetables, must in
fact be near the border line of vitamin C requirements, or actually receiving sub-optimal
amounts. The idea that a partial want of vitamin C of this kind may cause dental
disease gains some support from the observation made by Zinva and Wexts (1919)
that the teeth were the first of the body tissues to show any abnormality in the develop-
ment of scurvy in guinea-pigs deprived of all vitamin C. Since then histological studies
on the effects of vitamin C deficiency upon the teeth have been made by other workers,
including HésEer and Westin (1925), Toverup (1923), Key and Expuick (1931), also
working with guinea-pigs. We felt it was desirable, however, to examine in greater
detail and with improved technique the nature of the abnormalities, including the
lesions (if any) occurring in the enamel and the cementum (hitherto these had usually
been overlooked), more especially to find the effects of long-continued slight deficiencies
of vitamin C or of frequently repeated deprivations—in order to correspond the better
with the conditions actually prevailing in human experience.
