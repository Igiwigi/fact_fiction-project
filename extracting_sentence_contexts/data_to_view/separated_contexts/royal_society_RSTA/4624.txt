Even in the case of alloys containing above 25 per cent. of tin a
certain amount of the liquid eutectic exudes and runs away from the cylinder, thus
failing to impart its heat of solidification to the thermocouple on subsequent cooling. This fact must be borne in mind in connexion with the approximate quantitative
interpretation of these curves. On examining the curves of Series B it is found that the eutectic peak first appears

* The well-known “differential cooling-curves” are obtained by means of the apparatus of RoBERTS-
AusTEN, in which a specimen of the alloy under observation is allowed to cool in the same furnace, and,
therefore, at approximately the same average rate, as a standard neutral or comparison body.
