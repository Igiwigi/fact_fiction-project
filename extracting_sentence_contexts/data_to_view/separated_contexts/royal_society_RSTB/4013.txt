345-6). The main facts of its development bring A. rubens into much closer relationship
with the phanerozonate Asterina than with Cribrella and Solaster which like Asterias
are cryptozonate forms. This is notwithstanding the fact that in having large yolky
eggs and in the absence of pedicellarie, Asterina agrees rather with Cribrella and
Solaster than with Asterias rubens. It may be added that Porania pulvillus, which is a phanerozonate form
belonging to the Gymnasteriade (87, xxxiii) a family not far removed from the
Asterinide, agrees with the cryptozonate A. rubens, in the principal details of its
larval history. We are not yet in a position to throw much light from embryology on many of the difficult questions
of Asterid classification.
