In the last few decades, motion of socially interacting individuals has received a lot of attention. : a
This ranges from animals (insect swarms, fish schools and bird flocks) to human crowds. Various a
interesting mathematical models and questions arise from the fact that those animals adapt their [4
spatial motion due to some consensus reached with other individuals locally around them, e.g. : N
birds adapt their velocity to follow the flock without explicitly knowing a determined group : S
velocity. Hence, this is a natural paradigm of self-organized formation of macroscopic patterns [8

from microscopic interactions. The mathematical analysis of flocking has become popular after
Cucker & Smale [12] introduced a simple model that is accessible to rigorous arguments.
