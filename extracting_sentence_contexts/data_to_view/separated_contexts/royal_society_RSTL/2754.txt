A principal uſe of all theſe facts is, to explode-the

common theories of the generation of heat in animals, '
No attrition, no fermentation, or whatever elſe the me-
chanical and chemical phyſicians have deviſed, can ex-
plain a power capable of producing or deſtroying heat,
juſt as the circumſtances of the ſituation require. A
power of ſuch a nature, that it can only be referred to
the principle of life itſelf, and probably exerciſed only
in thoſe parts of our bodies in which life ſeems pecu-
liarly to reſide. From theſe, with which no confidera-
ble portion of the animal body is left unprovided, the
generated heat may be readily communicated to every
particle of inanimate matter that enters into, our com-
poſition, = This power of generating heat ſeems to at-
tend life very univerſally.
