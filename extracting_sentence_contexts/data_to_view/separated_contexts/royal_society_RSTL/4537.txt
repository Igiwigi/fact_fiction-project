My own experiments in reference to the subject were commenced in 1840, in which
year I communicated to the Royal Society my discovery of the law of the heat eyolved
by voltaic electricity, a law from which the immediate deductions were drawn,—lst,
that the heat evolved by any voltaic pair is proportional, ceteris paribus, to its inten-
£ity or electromotive force*; and 2nd, that the heat evolved by the combustion of
a body is proportional to the intensity of its aflinity for oxygen +. I thus snucceeded
in establishing relations between heat and chemical affinity. In 1843 I showed that
the heat evolved by magneto-electricity is proportional to the force absorbed ; and
that the force of the electro-magnetic engine is derived from the force of chemical
affinity in the battery, a force which otherwise would be evolved in the form of heat:
from these facts I considered myself justified in announcing * that the quantity of
heat capable of increasing the temperature of a Ib. of water by one degree of Faur-
ENHEIT's Scale, is equal to, and may be converted into, a mechanical force capable
of raising 838 1þs. to the perpendicular height of one foot.”

In a subsequent paper, read before the Royal Society in 1844, I endeavoured to
show that the heat absorbed and evolved by the rarefaction and condensation of air
is proportional to the force evolved and absorbed in those operations h. 'The quan-
titative relation between force and heat deduced from these experiments, is almost
identical with that derived from the electro-magnetic experiments just referred to,
and is confirmed by the experiments of M. Sg6vin on the dilatation of steam ||. From the explanation given by Count RumForp of the heat arising from the fric-
tion of solids, one might have anticipated, as a matter of course, that the evolution
of heat would also be detected in the friction of liquid and gaseous bodies.
