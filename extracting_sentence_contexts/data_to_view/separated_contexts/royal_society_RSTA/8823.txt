M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 375

arrangement in the AgD(4) linkage shown in the e¢, d, e columns of the map for
AgPiii[IV.]. The series is in fact continued further than is shown in the present map. Starting from 26727 we find a—c+b—d+a—c+a—ce (and +d) = 8a+b—(3c+d), the
actual separations being 770°92—803'607 +787°51—821°81+771'07 —803°66 +770°68
—803'16 (and +825'35). Further, it should be noted that each successive pair is a
parallel inequality, one in excess and the other in deficit of normal value.
