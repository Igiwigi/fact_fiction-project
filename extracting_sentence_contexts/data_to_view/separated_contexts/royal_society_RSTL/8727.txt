I quote the following sentencefrom par. 94:;—
« Although I most frequently speak of repulsion by heat, and in illustrating any of the
results obtained I generally use either the fingers or the flame of a spirit-lamp as a
convenient source of radiation, it must be clearly understood that these results are not
confined to the heating-rays of the spectrum, but that any ray, from the ultra-red to the
ultra-violet, will produce repulsion in a vacuum. I have already mentioned this fact in
my first paper (58, 68).” A few experiments were tried on the effect of radiation on surfaces the reflecting or
radiating power of which was modified by coating them with various substances. In
