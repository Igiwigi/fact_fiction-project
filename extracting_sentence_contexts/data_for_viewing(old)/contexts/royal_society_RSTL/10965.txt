It will be observed that there are differences in the meagurements of the fiducial
lines which cannot be accounted for by errors of observation, These differences may
be due to two causes : first, the difficulty of placing every photographic plate in exactly
the same position in the camera ; 8econd, to the alteration in length of the screw of
the dividing engine by change of temperature when the different plates were meagured.
That the temperature has some effect upon these measurements appears probable from
the fact that the first dozen or 80 of photographs which were measured on consecutive
days give those readings which agree most closely. The dividing engine could not be
kept always in the 8ame room, and on its removal it was probably snbjected to 8mall

changes of temperature such as would very nearly account for the discrepancy in the
readings. Thus, taking the linear coefficient of expansion of wrought iron to be
0:0000122 for 1? C., the length of screw to be 20 inches, and the change of tempera-
ture 5, the change in entire length would amount to 0'001 inch, or in 5 inches, which is
about the measured length of each photograph, to 0:000305, From this must be deducted
the coefficient of expansion of white glass, which amounts to 0000215 inch, which
reduces the error to 0:00019. The error is generally an increasing one as the distance
from zero increases.

We have taken advantage of our numerous measurements to reduce the error to a
minimum : first,
