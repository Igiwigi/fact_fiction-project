(26.) We sball now proceed to the more immediate object of this paper, viz. the
expression of the number of ways in which a given number z is susceptible of parti-
tion, the number of parts being given.
| Let & be the number of parts into which z is to be divided, and let 'TI(z) represent
the number of s-partitions of which it is susceptible.
