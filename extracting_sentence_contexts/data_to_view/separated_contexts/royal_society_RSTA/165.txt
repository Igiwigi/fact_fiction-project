Each cell is assigned
healthy /infected or dead flag depending on the interactions with its neighbours

for more details see Sloot et al. 2002). Different drug therapies can be modelled by differences in a response
distribution function over time. The function is chosen to model the fact that
he drug therapy will not immediately influence all of the infected cells, but
rather it will affect part of them at each time step. At the same time, the function
accounts for the concept of drug-resistant virus strains emerging. The simulation result for treatment naive individual dynamics is shown in
figure 5.
