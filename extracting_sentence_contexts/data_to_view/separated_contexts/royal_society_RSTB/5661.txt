point towards them. It was partly due to the fact that the centre of the second
primordium after the isolated primordium arose not in its normal position, but closer
to the wound, whereas the centre of the first primordium retained its normal position. This change in the position of the second primordium could not indeed be detected by
measurements of divergence angles, since the original position of the growing-point was
not known and attempts to locate it by reference to the older leaves proved unsuccessful. But finally a method was adopted of detecting—though not of measuring—changes in
the position of the next two primordia after the isolated primordium, by observing their
relation to the older leaves with which they
made contact.
