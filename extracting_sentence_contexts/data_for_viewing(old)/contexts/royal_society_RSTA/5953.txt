full ring polymer. Here, Ng = 6 and Np = 4. Note that the configuration of beads shown here is typical for an instanton in the
inverted regime, although the numbering scheme is identical in the normal regime. (Online version in colour.)

which is defined such that 2s, = sO for the instanton configuration and r= {10,...,1N/2} has
been redefined for the half ring polymer. Note that the bead labelling has changed compared with
equation (3.2), since cyclic indexing does not apply to the half ring polymer and there is only a
single hopping bead (figure 2).

When optimizing an instanton for a new system, one can use the fact that at high temperatures
the instanton will be compact and located near the MECP, which can itself be found with standard
methods [84-90]. A good initial guess for the value of rt is given by the classical, short-time limit
of the action (see discussion above equation (2.21)) [41]. It is therefore relatively easy to optimize
an instanton at high temperature, which can then serve as a starting point to slowly cool down
the system. This process is accompanied by the gradual expansion of the instanton.

In contrast to the normal regime, in the inverted regime of an exoergic reaction, the ring-
polymer instanton corresponds to a saddle point of index Npf + 1.3 In the inverted regime, we
can also employ the half ring-polymer approach (equation (3.8)), though here the index of the
required saddle point changes to Npf/2 +1. From figure 2, it can be seen how the half ring
polymer emerges from the full ring in a configuration typically assumed in the inverted regime.
