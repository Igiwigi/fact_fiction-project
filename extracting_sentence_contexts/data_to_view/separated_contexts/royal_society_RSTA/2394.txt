Remark 4.3. It is worthy of mention that if 42, 43 are in complex conjugate form, but the
remaining eigenvalues are all real, then theorem 4.2 will still guarantee the rightmost position of
the characteristic root. This is in some sense due to the fact that the complex conjugate nature
of eigenvalues and the eigenvalues with the smallest positive real part determine the worst
case scenario in a factor. For the more complicated cases, where 42 is real and the remaining
eigenvalues are a mix of real and complex numbers, the PR-design problem remains open. A unified framework is to be constructed in future work by combining the results in this
manuscript with those in [17].
