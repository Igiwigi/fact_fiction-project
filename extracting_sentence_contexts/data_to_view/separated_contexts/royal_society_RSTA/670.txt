Of these S 93 is under suspicion owing to the occurrence of slight
“knock”. This in itselfis interesting, for here is a case in which the substitution of water


SPECIFIC HEAT OF GASES AT HIGH TEMPERATURES 193

vapour for hydrogen in a hydrogen-nitrous oxide mixture scems to give rise to some
departure from the normal progressive combustion, despite the fact that the lower
initial pressure and explosion temperature of $93 (Table X) compared with S82
(Table IX) should have the reverse effect. As to the results obtained from these series, the simultaneous solution of the heat
capacity equations for $79 (Table IX) and $90 and 92 (Table X) gives the following
values of the mean molecular heats over the temperature range 373-2759" C (abs.): Cy, = 5-93, Cyo = 9-40 and Cy, = 6-32.
