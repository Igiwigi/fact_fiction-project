dry season was 85*5, During the monsoon it fell to 79®; average temperature of
rain water at the time, 757 ; of rivers, 76*. From its inferior specific gravity, the
fresh muddy water from the hills floats on the surface of the sea to considerable
distances, without being intimately blended. In the depth of the monsoon, near
Mangalore, in 1839, the water was observed to be nearly fresh a mile off the coast ;
and I have seen the Mediterranean discolcured by the turbid inundation of the Nile
to a distance of nearly forty miles from the Damietta embouchure.

Mean Temperature in India.—Colonel SykEs, in his statistics of the Deccan, has
already noted one remarkable feature touching the mean temperature of places at
elevations on the table-land of India, namely, that it is much higher than the mean
for the same places, calculated agreeably to MavzR's formula. To the instances he
has cited of this fact, of places on the plateau of the Deccan, may be added the fol-
lowing, occurring on the table-Jand of South India.
