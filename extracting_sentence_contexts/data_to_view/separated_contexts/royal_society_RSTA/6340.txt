We invoke hence (3.13) together with the estimates in (3.9) to obtain that

Remark that contrarily to (3.12), we here have some polynomial-type growth in the frequencies
that has to be controlled by the exponential decay (hence the need for a lower radius of Gevrey


regularity). Recalling that I(t) = (0/2) — 2'/3t we have that

Since this last term is bounded, the series of 0;T defined in (3.15) converges indeed in : 2

We infer that a similar argument implies also that the series generated by 0/"T, with m €N, :5
converge always in L®(0, tmax; Gil) This in particular implies that the function T belongs also : =
to C©(T x [0, tmax)), hence it is smooth. :8
In conclusion, we note that the constructed function T = T(x, t) in the function spaces specified [3
in (3.3) is indeed a weak solution of the main system (3.2), as it satisfies the equation in each :3

To conclude this section, we shall now devote our attention to the proof of the estimates in (3.9)
and (3.13). Throughout the forthcoming estimates, we will repeatedly consider high frequencies
satisfying |k| > 2(1 + |a|)9/.
