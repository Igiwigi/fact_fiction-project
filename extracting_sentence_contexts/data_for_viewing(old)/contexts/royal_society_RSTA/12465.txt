must be no term in 7 which will result in yV/ containing D. Thus the thermo-
magnetic effects must be left to the theory of irreversibility.

Tt might be thought that all difficulty would vanish if, in g, instead of D we substi-
tuted d, since this would involve terms in e similar to those given above for B and
since E= —e. This, however, is not the case. No term in e can affect steady
currents. The equation E + e = 0 determines the value of d but does not affect the
value of C. Again, since in equations (18) (14) we should have ¢ instead of C, we
see that no thermal effects would, owing to g, occur in a steady field.

86. None of these difficulties and restrictions are met with in the theory of
irreversibility. We shall find, however, that the thermoelectric consequences of
that theory are inconsistent with known facts. Both theories, therefore, are assumed
as true in part.

In connection with thermoelectricity it is necessary first to establish equations (19)
to (22) and (194) to (224). In these equations the notation adopted is that of
Professor Curystat’s article in the ‘Encye. Brit.” 9th ed. vol. viii, p. 97. He
there considers a circuit of two unstressed isotropic metals a and 0b, one of the
Junctions being at temperature @, and the other at temperature 6, The positive
direction round the circuit is taken as that from the metal a to the metal b at the
junction @. TI, o* are the Penrier and THomson effects at the temperature 0, and II,
the Prnrrer effect at the temperature 6, E is the electromotive force round the
circuit due to thermoelectric effects.
