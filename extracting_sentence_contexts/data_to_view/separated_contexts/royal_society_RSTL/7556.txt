In going on to the cases of the conics touching four or five given curves, the same
principles are applicable; the contact-loci have the Bipoint (a certain number of times
repeated) as a common threefold locus, and they besides intersect in a residual fourfold
or (as the case is) fivefold locus, and the order of the condition is equal to the order of
this residual locus; but the determination of the order of the residual locus presents
the difficulties alluded to, ante, No. 10. I do not at present further examine these cases,
nor the cases of the conics which have with a given curve or curves contacts of the
second or any higher order, or more than a single contact with the same given curve.

23. The equation of the conic has been in all that precedes considered as containing
the six parameters (a, b, c, f, 9g, k); but if the question as originally stated relates
only to a class of conics the equation whereof contains linearly 2, 3, 4, or 5 parameters,
or if, reducing the equation by means of any of the given conditions, it can be brought to
the form in question, then in the latter case we may employ the equation in such re-

duced form, attending only to the remaining conditions ; and in either case we have the
3, 4, or 5 parameters, which parameters are
or 4-dimensional space, and the discussion

above referred to, where the conics considered being the conics which pass through three
given points, the equation is taken to be fyz+gzv+hay=0, and we have only the three
parameters (f, g, k); and also in Annex No. 3, where the conics pass through two given
points, and are represented by an equation containing the four parameters (a, b, & h): T
give this Annex as a somewhat more elaborate example than any which is previously
considered, of the application of the foregoing principles, and as an investigation which
is interesting for its own sake, See also Annexes 4 and 5, which contain other exam-
ples of the theory.
