The sperm-bag evidently contains active spermatozoa (Plate XXXIV.fig. 13), having
an oval flattened body (of a high refracting power), and a caudal appendage, that,
while in the sac, is in constant vibratile movement; they are s0mewhat larger than,
and of the same general form as, human spermatozoa. I myself have never observed any action beyond the extrusion of the penis, but
my friend Mr. BriG6nTweELL has observed in seven different instances the direct copula-
tion of the*two sexes. The following quotation from his notice of the fact in the
Annals of Natural History for September 1848, clearly demonstrates this important
circumstance. * Observations as to the Union between the Sexes. * June 15th.â€”Placed a male and six females in a small glass trough by themselves,
and two males and about thirty females in a large trough.
