transfer by ordinary radiation at small distances, as Fourter imagined ; and it would
not appear why convection by a gas, even when highly rarefied, is so much more
efficient in the transfer of heat than radiation.

12. The result obtained by Ramsay and Young, and others, that all over the gas-
liquid range the characteristic equations of the substances on which they experimented
proved to be very approximately of the form p = aT + b, where a and b are functions
of the density alone, also supplies corroboration to this view. Expressing the
increment of energy per unit mass dE = Mdv + «dT, we have for the increment
of heat supplied dH = dE + pdv; and the fact that dE and dH/T are perfect
differentials shows immediately that M is equal to — b and « is independent of v; so
that the total (non-constitutive) energy per unit mass consists of two independent
parts, an energy of expansion and an energy of heating.* The latter part is the
thermal energy of the individual molecules ; it is a function of their mean states and
velocities alone, and constitutes almost all the energy in the gaseous state. The
former part is the energy of mutual actions between the molecules; it is negative
and bears a considerable ratio to the whole thermal energy in the liquid state, in the
case of substances with high latent heats of evaporation; for all gases except
hydrogen, inasmuch as they are cooled by transpiration through a porous plug, b is
negative at ordinary densities. Cf § 62, infra.

There would be no warrant for a view that the forces of chemical affinity fall off and
