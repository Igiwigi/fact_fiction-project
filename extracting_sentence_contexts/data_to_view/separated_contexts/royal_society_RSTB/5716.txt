The maxilla of the larval Conchostracan is thus not only totally different from that
of the adult, but is closely similar to that of an adult Lepidocaris. This can only
represent a definite case of recapitulation. Without going so far as to say that the
maxilla of Branchipus, of Sida, or of Lepidocaris is functionless, the fact of its minute
size and that we can see it disappearing in the Cladocera suggests, at least, that it is a
dwindling structure, and probably of little importance as a limb. Hence, that the
comparatively large and armed maxilla of an adult Conchostracan goes through this
simple but characteristic stage would appear purposeless unless it indicates that the
ancestor of the Conchostraca possessed such a degenerate maxilla. Now there is ample
evidence that the ancestral Crustacean possessed a maxilla of the typical biramous

type.
