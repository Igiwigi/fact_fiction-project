Sis mesial and dorsal insertion into the lateral surfaces of the centrum. Similarly, the

Bhe dorsal margin of the transverse membrane we described the latter as not only

Fpasses from the ventral surtace of the transverse process of the fourth vertebra to its
jauetion with the lateral ridge of the complex centrum and the radial nodule, exactly
coincides with the course of this strip of fibres, so that the lamina appears as an
vasified backward prolongation of the latter to an original insertion into the modified
transverse process. In fact, there can scarcely be any doubt that both the lateral
ridges and the dorsal Jamines result fram the ossification of the superficial cont of the
