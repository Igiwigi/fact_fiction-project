The reason is plain. In a length of 414
the rays capable of being absorbed by the gas are 80 much diminished, 80 few in fact
remain to be attacked, that an additional 8 inches of gas produces a scarcely sensible
effect. Similar considerations explain the fact, that while by augmenting the length of

the first chamber from 2:8 inches to 15:4 inches we increase the absorption of olefiant gas
nearly 20 per cent., the shortening of the second chamber by precisely the same amount
effects a diminution of barely 4 per cent. of the absorption. All these results conspire to
prove the heterogeneous character of the radiation from a source heated to about 250Â® C. The suwm of the absorptions placed side by side with the absorption of the &um ex-
hibits the influence of sifting in an instructive manner.
