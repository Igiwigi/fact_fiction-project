On June 1, owing to renewed difficulty with the circulation in the glass-bottom

€ tank, five more of the specimens in this experiment died, only one being left alive.

g The condition of these five was as follows :—

=  (1.) Length 12-4 centims., pigmented all over the lower aide, except the head and

extreme caudal region. S&  (2.) Length 11:3 centims., pigment less continuous, but still covering nearly the
whole side.

(3.) 11°6 centims., same as (2), but a little less pigment.

(4.) 9°9 centims., same as (3).

(5.) 7°6 centims., pigment only in small patches. The last surviving specimen of this experiment was pigmented at this date, and is
now (September 29, 1892), about 23 centims. long, and pigmented over all the
lower side except the head and caudal portion ; it exhibits, in fact, more pigmentation
than is shown in the figure. The features of this experiment then briefly recapitulated are: Fish in glass-bottom
