The large resting electromotive difference between the surface and cross
section of the cord having been balanced, an excitatory electrical effect in the opposite
Jirection to the difference was observed to accompany the stimulation of the nerve. The amount of this effect, as indicated by the amount of the galvanometric excursion,
varied, as previously stated, not merely with the intensity and the duration of the
stimulus, but with the condition of anzesthesia, &c., of the animal. If care be taken
io keep these factors as far as possible unchanged, the excitatory electrical effect thus
produced at each repetition of the experiment keeps very fairly uniform, as much so
point of fact as in similar experiments upon Mammalian nerve trunks. When we
aH thus obtained a constant effect in the cord, an intervening section was made in
HB lower dorsal or upper lumbar region by the method described in Chapter III.,
F tion 2. Its position coincided, in some cases, with the lowest portion of the part
Bthe dorsal cord exposed for connection with the galvanometric electrodes, in the
@Bjority of cases with a still lower level obtained by a fresh exposure of a small
partion of cord.
