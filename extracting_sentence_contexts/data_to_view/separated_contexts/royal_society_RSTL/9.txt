London, 1673. in 89,

He Dialogue about Cold preſenting is ſelf firſt in theBody

of this Book, though it be named laſt in the Title-

page, we ſhall firſt of all take notice of the ſame in the Ac-
count we intend togive of theſe TraQs,

One of theſe Dialogiſts therefore having taken occaſion
from Mr, Boyle's Hiſtory of Cold to exprefs his wonder, that
that Noble and latelligent Author had in that Hiſtory omit-
ted to tell the Learned world, whether he aflerts Cold to be
a Poſitive quality, or a bare Privation of Heat ; and another
of them having conjeur'dithe principal reaſon of that ſilence
to be that Author's unwillingneſs to. deliver io abſtruſe ſub-
jets a poſitive opinion before a compleat Hiſtory of the Phe-
nomena be deliver'd; it being much ſafer to reſerve that for
the latter end, when the Nature of the thiog inquired into
may of it ſelf reſult from the Conſiderations, ſuggelted by the

recedent matters of fact ſurveyed aud compared together :
heſe two, 1 ſay, having thus made an Introduftion to this
Diſcourſe, the Author of it maketh it his buſineſs to examine
all the weighty Arguments, alledged by Gaſendus, ſeeming
ſtrongly to maintain the Poſtzve vature of Cold z but yet, in
ftrift ratiocipation found to be not cogent, Where the Author,
among other particulars,ſhews,that thoſe Bodies muſt be Cold
as to ſenſe, whoſe parts are leſs agitated thao thoſe of our
Hands,and conſequently Metals,Stone, Wood,and other Solid
bodies, as alſo all unmingled Liquors we know, being hea-
ted by the fire, will grow cold again of themſelves, becauſe
the adventitious motion ceaſing by degrees, either upon di

( 6128 ) receſs of the igneous corpuſcles, or the imparting of the ex:
tratieous agitation to the Air or other contiguous bodies, the
Stone or Water,8&c, will again have ſo much fainter an agita-
tion, than that of a man's Senſory , as to be by him judged
Cold, And if this already impaired agitation be ſtill more
and more leſſen'd, the Body will (till grow colder and cold-
er without the help of any Poſitive cauſe ; till at length the
apil parts, that keptit warm or fluid, bciog quite expelled
or diſabled, the form of the liquor, for example, comes to be
exchanged for that of Ice,

Several conſiderable Experiments of Mr,Boy!e7 being in this
Diſcourſe occaſionally refer'd to, one of the Interlocators
mentions not only the particular ſcruples, but alſo divers phe-
omena of Experiments, that kept the ſame Gentleman from
declaring himſelf about the Niture and Cauſe of Cold,

Tothis Dialogue are annexed three ſmall pieces by Mr,
Boyle ;

The firſt contains two Problems about Cold; grounded on
New Experiments; whereof one is, How upon the mixture of
two or three Bodies there ſhould manifeſtly enſue a great and th»
multuary agitation of ſmall parts, and yet even during this con-

flift, not any ſenſible Heat,but a conſiderable degree of Coldbe pro.
duced, and that even in the Internal parts of the mixture 2 The
other is, hence the vaſt force of freezing water proceeds 2
Theſecond, delivers an Attempt to manifeſt and meaſure the
greatExpanſive force of Freezing water,by threeExperiments,
The th:rd,recites a NewExperimenr about the Produdion of
Cold by theConflict of bodies appearing to make anEbullition,
From theſe Particulars this Book proceeds to another Tra®,
containing 0bſervations and Experiments about the Saltneſs
of the Sea.
