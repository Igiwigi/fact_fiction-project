The
dehiscence mechanism is indicated by banded cells of the whole epidermal surface. The pollen grains are oval, striately marked with several meridional ridges, and
0-055 mm. by 0Â°04 mm.

Special interest attaches to the interpretation of the andrcecium, since it was
described by Hooker in 1864, from the standpoint of the theoretical diagram,
additional evidence, of doubtful value, having been adduced from (1) the facts of
development (McNan, 1872; Srraspurcer, 1872) and (2) the bundle supply
(Licnier and Trson, 1912). The most general account (Hooker, 1864) simply states that the six stamens,
being all alike, and similarly carried up on a tube extension, represent a single whorl
of six members, placed symmetrically around the flower, with two transverse
members, and no exactly median ones; this being the arrangement seen directly on
looking at an open flower, or on cutting a section of the anthers as arranged in the
bud, or a section of the staminal tube with its vascular bundles. This view states
simple easily checked facts, and indicates that the androecium is not conformable
with the preceding decussate perianth and prophyll system.
