Class---I. Movements asserted to be bilateral, but not actually so.

Movements of the Trunk Muscles.—The muscles of the trunk have above all others
in the body been commonly supposed to be bilaterally associated in action. This is,
however, quite contrary to observed fact. We have never seen any movement of
both recti or oblique abdominis follow excitation of the fibres for the trunk muscles
in the capsule, although we invariably saw movement restricted to the muscles of the
opposite side, notably the rectus. We have observed this to be the case clinically,
and believe that the statements made in the-opposite direction rest upon imperfect
examination, Further confirmation is to hand in the description given by Professor
ScHArer* and one of us, of the results of excitation and ablation respectively of the
“trunk areas ” in the marginal gyrus, from which it appears that the same unilateral
representation was discovered to exist.

Movements of the Tongue.—As we are specially investigating the cortical represen-
tation of these movements, we desire to defer the detailed observation of the capsular
fibres subserving the same, until the former is completed.
