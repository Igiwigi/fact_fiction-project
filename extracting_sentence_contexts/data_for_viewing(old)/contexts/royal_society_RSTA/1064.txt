experimentally measured harmonic emission from a two-cycle, 550 J, 1.8 pm wavelength driving
field focused into an 800\1m needle filled with helium as a function of backing pressure. The
harmonic emission, which spans the water window, is strongly modified by the backing pressure,
illustrating the importance of phasematching, and thus the harmonic phase, in SXR HHG.

As ground state depletion leads to a hard limit for the maximum usable intensity, we instead
increase the driving wavelength to increase the harmonic energy; this comes at the expense of
longer electron excursion times in the continuum. Long excursion times have two significant
drawbacks—the first is a direct decrease in the harmonic yield at the single-atom level, with
estimates of the exact scaling between 2-> and 4~° [22,24]. This is because (i) the electron
wavepacket has more time to spread in the transverse direction, decreasing the probability of
colliding with the atom, (ii) the increased longitudinal spreading of the electron wavepacket
means the electron amplitude is spread over a wider range of energies, (iii) the fact that the dipole
matrix elements responsible for the harmonic emission generally decrease with emitted photon
energy and (iv) the intrinsic 1 /o* scaling of dipole emission [24]. For a fixed harmonic energy,
increasing the wavelength causes the corresponding long trajectories to be born closer to the peak
of the field, and the short trajectories to be born further away from it; the exponential scaling of
the tunnel ionization probability then leads to a suppression of the short trajectories. The second


effect of the long excursion times is an increase in the harmonic phase ¢(w), and in the intensity
dependence of this phase. In particular, it can be shown that, for a given trajectory,
