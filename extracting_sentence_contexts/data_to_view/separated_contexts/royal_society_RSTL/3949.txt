Such a tube indeed is ge-
nerally advantageous in all these experiments. If, instead of water, the test cylinder be plunged into a solution of quinine, all
else remaining as before, the blue film in question totally disappears. I tried a great
many other liquids, all in fact which I had at hand in sufficient quantity and colour-

Tess, or but little coloured, in hopes of discovering something which might elucidate
the subject. Strong alcohol, solation of corrosive sublimate, ammonia, &c. acted as
water; allowing the blue film to be seen externally at a perpendicular incidence of
the visnal ray to the surface of the liquid. With strong sulphuric acid, and with
muriate of lime s0 concentrated as to be syrupy, this was not possible, but the film
became visible, and of its full intensity, on moving the eye forward (i. e. towards the
incident light).
