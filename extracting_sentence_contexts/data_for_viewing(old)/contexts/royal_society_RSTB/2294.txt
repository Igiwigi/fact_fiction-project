tubes medullary rays. At either flank is situated a group of albuminous cells. The
primary phloem, which is composed of a number of large irregular cells, and occurs
outside the inner phloem, is bounded externally by a well-marked horseshoe-shaped
limiting layer ; the ends of which impinge on to the two groups of albuminous cells
already mentioned.

With reference to this arrangement, a point of some interest should be mentioned
here, namely, that the limiting layer, supplemented by the two albuminous groups,
forms a definite cordon of cells intercalated between the phloem and the pericycle, so
that any connection between these two tissues must take place through the cells of
the composite investing layer.

It will be seen later on that, as a matter of fact, it is the albuminous cells which
are of especial importance in forming the connecting link between the pericycle and
phloem.

The arrangement of the connecting threads in the phloem sheath of the cotyledon
is particularly interesting. The cells of the sheath are much smaller than those of
the primary phloem, and in transverse section resemble parenchyma cells, but in
longitudinal section they are long and somewhat like sieve tubes.
