Whatever be the cause of this, it will
be found that it is also the cause of the expression in sickness,
and pain, and exhaustion, whether of body or mind: for
then the eye-lids are relaxed and fallen, and the pupils ele-
vated 80 as to be half covered by the upper eye-lid. This
condition of the eye during its insensible unexercised state,
we are required to explain. It isa fact familiar to pathologists, that wi debility arises
from affection of the brain, the influence is greatest on those
muscles which are, in their natural condition, most under the
command of the will. We may perceive this in the progres-
sive stages of debility in the drunkard, when successively the
muscles of the tongue, the eyes, the: face, the limbs, become
unmanageable ;: and, under the same circumstances, the
muscles which have a double office, as those of the chest,
lose their voluntary motions, and retain their involuntary
motions, the force of the arms is gone long before-the action
of breathing is affected. If we transfer this principle, and apply it to the muscles
of the eye, we shall have an easy solution of the phenomena
above enumerated.
