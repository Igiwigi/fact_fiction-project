that the diminution of convective effect, consequent upon the high conducting power
of the metallic media used in these experiments, might be fully compensated for by
the enormous quantity of electricity passing. In fact, it is impossible not to expect
some effect, whether sensible or not, of the kind in question, when such a current is
passing through a fluid offering a sensible resistance to the passage of the electricity;
and, thereby, giving proof of a certain degree of insulating power (1328.). 1604. I endeavoured to connect the convective currents in air, oil of turpentine, &e.
and those in metals, by intermediate cases, but found this not easy to do.
