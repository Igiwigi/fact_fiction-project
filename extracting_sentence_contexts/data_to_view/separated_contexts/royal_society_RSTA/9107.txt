higher temperatures, it is impossible to deduce from these observations an accurate
value for the depression constant. of the glass. Fig. 9 is a typical curve of zeros which
shows that very few of the observations are as much as 0-003° C. off the mean curve. The discontinuity at 20° C. is due to the fact that, for convenience, the curve was plotted
in short sections (Section VI).
