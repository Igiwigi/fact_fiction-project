The experimental results will be found plotted in figs. 2 to 6. It will be seen
that in all cases above about 10 atmospheres the emissivity is practically a linear
function of the temperature, from which fact we conclude that the loss by radiation
must be relatively very small. We may therefore write for any given pressure

E=m + n9. Both the values m and 2 increase as the pressure rises: closer observation shows
that for any one gas they may be expressed as exponential functions of the pressure.
