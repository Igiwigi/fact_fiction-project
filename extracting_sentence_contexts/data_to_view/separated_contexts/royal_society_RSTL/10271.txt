It is therefore clear that the mall quantity of manganese present enters into that
which must be regarded for magnetic purposes as the molecule of iron, and completely
changes its properties. The fact is one which must have great significance in any
theory as to what is the molecular nature of magnetisation. Another clearly marked
fact is the exceptionally great, effect, which hardening has both upon the magnetic
properties and the electrical resistance of chrome steel. Note also that in those cages where the maximum induction is low, the residual
magnetism is proportionately lower still, but that the coercive force is not uniformly
lower, This is in accordance with the supposition that these samples are to be
regarded as mechanical mixtures of a strongly magnetic substance, such as ordinary
iron or steel, and a non-magnetic substance, &uch as manganese steel with 12 per
cent. of manganese. A feature present in all the curves may some day hays &
bearing on the molecular theory of magnetism.
