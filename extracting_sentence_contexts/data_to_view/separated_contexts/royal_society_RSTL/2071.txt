doubtofthefact. Ihave occasionally shown it toseveral friends;
although I have not in every instance succeeded in this. To have omitted to state in this paper the fact of such a
retrograde motion would have been uncandid, because it is
one which is strongly opposed to all the reasoning that it
contains. To abstain from giving any explanation, however
imperfect, that might reconcile it with my view of the sub-
ject, would be to leave untouched a very powerful, and almost
Solitary argument against the explanation which I have pro-
posed both of magnetic and electric rotation. I shall there-
fore attempt to show, not merely that it is not repugnant to
the principle which I have already explained, but that that
very principle may, in certain circumstances, produce the
retrograde motion, and that in others nearly similar, it shall
not take place; thus not merely showing the possibility of the
fact, but accounting for its apparently capricious nature.
