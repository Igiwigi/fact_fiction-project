So little information exists as to the geology of this coalfield as a whole, that it
will be necessary in this instance to deal with this subject more fully than is usually
needed in a paper which is chiefly of paleeobotanical interest.

The Wyre Forest Coalfield is, as we have seen, continuous in the North near
Bridgnorth with that of Coalbrookdale (see map, p. 367).* Between that town and
a point about 2 miles south-west of the Abberley Hills, a distance from North to
South of roughly 18 miles, we find a tract of Coal Measures of varying breadth
with an area of about 35,000 acres. This is known as the Wyre Forest, or the
Forest of Wyre, or sometimes as the Bewdley coalfield.

I have ascertained that the beds in different parts of this area belong to different
horizons, and in view of this fact and of our present very imperfect knowledge of
the geology of the district, it is essential to distinguish clearly between four regions
in the Wyre Forest. These I propose to term the Highley, Dowles Valley, Shatter-
ford and Mamble regions.

The Highley Region may be taken to include the whole of the Northern part of
the coalfield, from the neighbourhood of Bridgnorth as far South as an imaginary
East and West line drawn parallel to the Dowles Brook, and about 1 mile to the
North of it (see map, p. 367). This area on the East is bounded by the Severn, on
the West by Old Red Sandstone. In the North the productive measures are largely
overlain by the so-called Permians. The width of the outcrop of the former
increases towards the South, and is believed to reach its maximum along a line drawn
roughly East and West through the Kinlet doleritic intrusion and Upper Arley.
