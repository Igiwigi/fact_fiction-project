Odd-integer alteration of characters.

7. The effect is obviously to interchange the different functions,


AND DOUBLE THETA-FUNCTIONS. 901

Even. and odd functions.

8. It is clear that —m—a, —n—Þ have precisely the same series of yalues with
ma n+ B respectively : hence considering the function

(93) (> —0)

the linear term in the argument of the exponential may be taken to be

Jniſ—m—a—u+y.+.—n—B.—v+8},
which is
=Jni{mb+an+y +n+8v+85; —TifmEbay.+n+Þ5:;

the second term is here = —Ti(my+18) —Ti(zy+P8), where my+18 being an even
integer the part —Ti(my +78) does not alter the value of the exponential : the effect
of the remaining part —Ti(&y+P8) is to affect each term of the series with the factor
exp. —Ti(zy+P8), or what is the same thing, exp. ri(zy+P8), each of these being in
fact =(—)7*%,

We have thus

s( #) (—n,—v)=(— yromg(® 4 (, »),

Viz, a(= v4 (1, v) is an even or odd function of the two arguments (#, v) conjointly,

B

according as the characteristic (% ) is even or odd.

The quarter-periods unity.

9. Taking 2 and w integers, we have from the definition

{(5 2) (us, v+vw)= 4( Py + BT »),

Viz., the effect of altering the arguments 1, v into u+z, v+w is simply to interchange
the Motions as shown by this formula. If z and w are each of them even, then replacing them by 2z, 2w respectively, we

have

a(5 a) (u+2z, v+2w)= a( {ir 3+ PS (1, v),
