where K is the equilibrium constant. This result is usually presented as the principle of mass
action. The concentration of a given promoter state is the total DNA concentration multiplied by
the probability of occurrence of that state. If we agree to measure all free energies as differences
from that of the bare configuration, a comparison of (2.2) and (2.4) shows

That is, the values of the reaction rate constants are constrained by free-energy differences: their
ratio must be consistent with the equilibrium prediction. There is in fact a much more basic
constraint on the kinetic constants. Imagine that the DNA is involved in several complexes.
In that case the condition P, =P_, while sufficient to ensure time-invariance of probabilities,
is certainly not necessary. It could be that the depletion of a certain species through one
reaction is compensated for, not by the reverse reaction, but by a separate creation pathway.
However, detailed balance asserts that in equilibrium such solutions are not acceptable: all
forward reactions must be balanced by the corresponding reverse reactions. This fact is not at
all evident from a reaction-kinetic formulation. While it will be convenient to work within the
kinetic framework of rate constants, we must always bear in mind the constraints imposed by
equilibrium considerations.

We can now use these general results to study a few relevant examples, where we now
explicitly treat multi-step reactions. Consider a DNA region D to which the protein X can bind.
