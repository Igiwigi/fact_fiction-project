We have at least one example (SN 2013ej) of a possible SN II-L which may have resulted
from the explosion of a more massive RSG. Whether this trend continues requires detecting the
progenitors of other SNe II-L. In fact, the supposed ‘red supergiant problem’ [64,100] for SNe II-P
needs many more cases of RSG progenitors of whatever initial mass to determine if it is indeed
an issue. We really still have been dealing with relatively small-number statistics. At least some
SNe IIb emerge from warmer supergiants that are more ‘yellow’ than red (although, see the case
of the ‘compact’ SN IIb 2008ax [31,141]).
