On the” theory which T have adopted, this circumstance is
what ought to be expected. Potassium has a much stronger
affinity for oxygene than sodium ; and must condense it much
more, and the resulting higher specific gravity of the com»
bination is a necessary consequence.

M. Ritter has $tated, that of all the metallic substances he
tried for producing potassium by negative VoLTaic electricity,
tellurium was the'only one by which he could-not procure it.
And he states the very curious fact, that when a circuit of
electricity is completed in water, by means of two surfaces of
tellurium, oxygene is given” off at the 'positive surface, no
hydrogene at the negative surface, but/abrown'powder which
he regards as ahydruret of tellurium, is formed and separates
from it ; and he conceives that the reason why tellurium pre-
vents the metallization of  potash is, that it has a stronger
attraction for hydrogene, than that alkali.

These cireumstances of the action of tellurium upon water,
are $0 different from those presented by the action of other
metals, that they can hardly fail to arrest the attention of
chemical enquirers. I have made'some experiments on the
