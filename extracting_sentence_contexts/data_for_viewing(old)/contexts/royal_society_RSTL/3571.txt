=, and the expression becomes

(+—SeosR) S+FeosR.8 or +8,

which is independent of R. The total light, therefore, is independent of R, or is
equal at all ts ; and therefore no bands are produced.

2. But if < © though small, is not exceedingly small, the principal impression may

be made upon #% eye by the central patch of light from each source, included be-
tween the values w = — 180, w = + 180*; while those parts of the light which ex-
tend beyond the central patch may be in fact aggregated with the central patches of
light from the sources at a small distance on each side. And if the amounts in the
central patches from different sources are unequal, while the whole amounts from the
different sources are equal, it is evident that a bright central patch from one source
may be combined with bright detached parts from another source, while a fainter
central patch from that second sonree may be combined with an insignificant detached
part from the first source, and thus the whole inequality of light may be double the
inequality of the central patches. Now the amount of the light in the central patch,
as we have found, is greatest, and represented by 7234, when R = 0 or = 2n 7, and
is least, and is represented by 6517, when R = 7 or = 2 n 2n+1.7. The difference of
these is th of the whole; and therefore the difference of the whole light on each
part of the retina, formed by combining the central patch formed by one s0urce with
the detached light formed by another source, will be nearly 4th of the whole. This
