The ‘‘ curves of distortion,” if we could determine their true
shape, would probably be approximately of the form shown in fig. 9. The theoretical
methods of this paper enable us to fix the position of A, the “ point of bifurcation,”
but give no information as to the form of AB, beyond the fact that it cuts OA at
right angles.* The other curves of the diagram will approach more and more closely
the limiting form OAB as the initial value of the amplitude is decreased. In the second case, we have the additional complication of elastic break-down
under finite stress, which reduces the resistance of the material and causes the new
“curves of distortion,” shown by thick lines in fig.
