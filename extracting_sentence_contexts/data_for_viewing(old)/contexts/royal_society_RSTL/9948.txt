nitrogen of the previous applicationsâ€”or, whether to the development of different
plants, having more extended root-ranges, or different powers of collection from
natural sources ? For certainly it was due to the latter causes that where, as on
plob 7, mineral without any nitrogenous manures were applied every year, there was
yet yielded, over the 20 years, even rather more nitrogen in the produce than was
obtained on plot 5, where 82 Ibs. of nitrogen were applied per acre annually, It will
be remembered that the surface-soil of the continuously mineral-manured plot showed a
lower percentage of nitrogen than that of the continuously unmanured plot, indicating
the source whence the increased yield of nitrogen in the mineral manured complex
herbage had been derived.

The data at command do not enable us to give a decisive answer on these points,
but i will be of interest briefly to notice the facts bearing upon them.

In the first place, not quite three-fourths as much nitrogen was taken off in the
total produce of plots 5 and 6, during the 13 years of the application of the ammonia-
salts to both, as was contributed by the manure during that period. And if we deduct
