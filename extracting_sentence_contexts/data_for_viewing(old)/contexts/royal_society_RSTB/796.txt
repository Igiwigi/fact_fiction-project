22 DR. C. I. FORSYTH MAJOR ON MEGALADAPIS MADAGASCARIENSIS,

Megaladapis the vertical extension of the parietal is the double of that of the
squamosal ; in Lemur the first is four times higher than the last ; whereas in Adapis,
on the contrary, the vertical extent of the squamosal, near the occipital crest, is
scarcely less than that of the parietal, and even exceeds it, if the sagittal crest be dis-
regarded. In Lemur, as well as in most existing Lemurids, the great disproportion
in the respective heights of the parietal and squamosal, is in relation with the greater
volume of the brain-case ; this does not, however, explain the vertical development of‚Äù
the squamosal in Megaladapis, and the still greater in Adapis, in which last a nearer
approach to the Marsupialia is given than by Megaladapis. How little classificatory
value can be attributed to this structure is sufficiently illustrated by the fact that we
find very high parietals amongst Ungulates and Rodents as well. This same remark
applies to the vertical extension of the zygomatic arch.

Tn a skull of Adapis parisiensis (Br. Mus.) the occipital condyles approach to the
vertical position exhibited in Megaladapis. They are perfectly vertical, as in this
last, in a skull of Galago from the Kilima-Njaro (Br. Mus., 92, 10, 18, 10) and in
Perodicticus potto.

In other existing Lemurids, as Lemur, Hapalemur, Propithecus, in which the
horizontal diameter of the foramen magnum is equal or superior to its vertical
diameter, the anterior portions of the condyles are directed inwards, the posterior
portions externally.
