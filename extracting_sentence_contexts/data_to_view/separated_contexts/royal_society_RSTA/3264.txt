Such features are
responsible for the observed intricate vibrational spectrum [79,80]. Several gas-phase and matrix
studies of C3 have subsequently been devoted to its spectroscopic characterization, resulting in
the assignment of the most ground and upper state vibrational frequencies of the A!/7,-X! ze
band [81-85] and the discovery of a low-lying triplet electronic state manifold [86-88]. In fact, the
carbon trimer is perhaps one of the best characterized non-rigid triatomics in existence [2,89]. Cz has been observed in a wide range of astrophysical sources [90,91], including circumstellar
shells of carbon stars [4,92,93], interstellar molecular clouds [7,94-96] and comets [3,92]. Its mid-
IR spectrum (v3 antisymmetric stretching mode) was measured in the circumstellar envelope of
the C-rich star IRC+10216 by Hinkle et al. [4], and the far-IR one (vz) detected in the direction
of Sgr B2 by Cernicharo eft al. [92].
