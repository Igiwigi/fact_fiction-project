A few cases, where the differences are larger, call for special comment. For example, the calculated and observed mobilities of the hydrogen ion in hydro-
chloric and nitric acid solutions agree very well indeed, whereas the agreement is by
no means good for the velocities of the anions of these acids. This is explained by
the fact that the velocity of the hydrogen ion is about five times as great as that of
the chlorine ion (or nitrate ion), and as a consequence the latter only moves about
10 millims., whilst the former moves through the whole length of the tube. The
result of this is that there is a very much larger percentage experimental error
introduced in the measurement of the mobility of the anion than in that of the cation
of an acid. The same applies, but in the opposite sense, to the measurement of the
mobilities of the anion and cation of an alkali.
