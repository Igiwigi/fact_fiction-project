“got the calorimeter. The maximum percentage error due to radiation in a length of
ca centims. is therefore 55 per cent. This is on the assumption that there is no
gjacket round the wire, but even then the actual loss would probably be less than
8 per cent. if currents of air be avoided. This rough calculation shows that radiation
from the surface of the wire need not be considered as an objection to the method.
g 2. Possible error due to the fact that the thermometers are not actually at the
ends of the wire, and so may not be indicating the proper temperatures.
:. The effect of this error would also be to give too low a value for the conductivity.
8To guard against this the bottom of the box is made very thick, and the large block
eK (fig. 2) is added so as to hold the thermometer. The difference of temperature
Abetween the inside and outside surfaces of the bottom of the box is certainly
exceedingly small, if as much heat as the wire can take away is supplied to it.
Since the heat is supplied by boiling water, it is, however, possible that the copper
conducts so quickly that there is always a layer of water, it may be thin, immediately
in contact with the metal at a very much lower temperature than 100° C. This
point is particularly emphasized by Lord Ketvrn in volume 3 of his Collected Papers,
where he remarks upon the exceedingly low values obtained by Ciiment and by
Péter for the conductivity of copper. These experimenters both attempted to
