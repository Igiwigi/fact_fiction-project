C., and it will be observed that not only is the maximum diminution of
resistance lessened by raising to 100? C. to an amount which is less than one-half of the
maximum diminution at the lower temperature, but that also the load ab which this
maximum diminution occurs is much less ; and it may well be that ab a snfficiently
high temperature the decrease of resistance which is observed to be produced by
moderate loads at the lower temperatures would be changed to an increase. In fact,
I am inclined very strongly to believe that there exists with all metals a eritical
temperature below which temporary stress will produce temporary decrease of resist-
ance, and that above this temperature there is an opposite effect caused by the stress. The value of © Young's modulus” was determined for this piece of nickel by the
method of static extension, in a manner to be presently described, and was equal to
2480 x 106 at the temperature of 16? C. and to 2280 X 10% at the temperature of 100* C.
