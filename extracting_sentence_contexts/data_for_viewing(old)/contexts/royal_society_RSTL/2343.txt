It may be likewise remarked, that when a neutral conductor, m, fig. 10, is exposed
to the inductive action of an excited body, n, and is at the same time touched with an
uninsulated conductor, it will have its original quantity of electricity either increased
or diminished according as the electricity of the excited body n is positive or negative.

Now an electroscope, A, will not indicate the change which has been effected in
the conductor mz $0 long as it remains exposed to the influence of the excited body ;
but if we remove the excited body, or otherwise make it neutral, then the electroscope
A will immediately diverge.

It is not essential here to enter upon the theoretical explanations of these pheno-
mena, the mere facts being alone requisite; for whatever theory may be considered

as sufficient to account for them, it should be equally applicable under whatever
peculiar form they may present themselves.

22. If these phenomena, then, be considered in reference to the accumulation of
electricity on conducting bodies, there may appear some reason to conclude, that a
portion of the whole force becomes, as it were, masked in respect of the electro-
meter. Thus, taking two terms only, the force evinced by a single quantity, by the
