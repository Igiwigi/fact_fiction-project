Tt is very thick, and the cells vary in form, being sometimes
much larger, as well as more fusiform, than at others ;- whilst towards the exterior of the
layer radial sections exhibit in a very marked manner the arrangement of prismatic cells
seen in Plate XLIII. fig. 17. These cells are elongated vertically in a very regular
manner, having a uniform diameter from end to end of about :0025. Their length varies
greatly: sometimes, though not often, they are almost square ; at others they are 80 much
elongated, especially at the outer portion of the layer, that they almost assume the form
of yessels; but what gives them their remarkable appearance is the fact that clusters of
them have exactly the same length, and are arranged in the same radial plane, causing

numerous straight lines of transverse cell-walls to traverse the section horizontally from
within outwards, as shown in Plate XLIIL. fig. 17, 7. There is no doubt that the walls of
the more tubular of these elongated cells are thickened by internal depositions of lignine,
and that they thus assume the character of bast-tissnes. I have already described thin-
walled cells arranged in regular rows which, in outward form, closely resemble those of
Plate XLIIT. fig. 17, but occurring in the primary and secondary medullary rays of
Calamites.
