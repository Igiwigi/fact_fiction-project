models also have a tendency for increased values of longwave CRE in low cloud regimes, owing
to increases in high-level cloud fractions and/or IWP. Increased shortwave reflection from low-
level clouds in particular results in increased biases in the top-of-atmosphere radiative balances
of the ConvOff models.

The overall range in global cloud feedback in the standard model configurations is maintained
in the ConvOff experiments, increasing by 22%. The models all show increases in low level cloud
fraction when parametrized convection is switched off, substantially increasing the shortwave
radiation reflected to space. Applying a simple bias correction method to allow for differences
in present-day global mean net CRE substantially reduces the differences between the global
mean cloud feedbacks with and without parametrized convection in the individual models. The
cloud feedbacks in the two ensembles become strongly correlated, with the Convoff experiments
exploring 85% of the overall range from the standard models. This correlation, and the fact that the
models are capable of exploring much of the overall range in cloud feedbacks without convective
parametrizations active, strongly suggests that although parametrized convection influences the
strength of the cloud feedbacks substantially in some models, aspects of model formulation other
than convective parametrization ultimately determine the overall range in the cloud feedbacks in
the models examined here.

It is in principle possible that changes to the details of convective parametrizations which
are not included in our current ensemble could have larger impacts on global cloud feedbacks
than those seen here. However, our current standard and ConvOff ensembles already span the
range in cloud feedbacks typically seen in climate models. Hence, adding new models or different
convection schemes to our current ensembles would not affect our finding that the models can
explore much of the range of contemporary cloud feedbacks without parametrized convection.
