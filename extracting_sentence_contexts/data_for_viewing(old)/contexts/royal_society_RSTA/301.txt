theory of hydroelasticity and the mathematical methods of solving associated
complex problems are not well established and are still under development.
The mathematical difficulties are viewed as the major obstacle to adequate and
successful treatment of problems in hydroelasticity in both academic research and
applications.

Hydroelasticity is concerned with the deformations of elastic bodies responding
o hydrodynamic excitations and simultaneously the modification of these
excitations owing to the body deformation. The problems of hydroelasticity are
coupled, which implies that the elastic deformations of the body depend on the
aydrodynamic forces and vice versa. The problems of coupled fluid motion and
elastic deformations of a body in contact with the fluid are difficult to study both
heoretically and numerically. In particular, the difficulties are due to the fact that
he hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of an elastic body depend strongly
