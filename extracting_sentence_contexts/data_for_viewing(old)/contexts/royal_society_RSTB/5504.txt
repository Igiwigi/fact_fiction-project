The splanchnocranium at this stage is represented by Mecxet’s cartilage with a well-
developed malleus, the incus, the stapes, the basihyal, stylohyal, and thyrohyal carti-
lages, and by the thyroid cartilages, which have now made their appearance. Behind
and median to the thyroid cartilages are the rudiments of the cricoid cartilages.

Stage 11.—17 days, 20-5 mm. g.l.; 10mm. hl. (Plate 39, fig. 23.)

This stage presents a number of features of considerable interest and importance,
most of which are to be seen in a ventral view of the chondrocranium. In the ala
temporalis the lamina ascendens has appeared. The processus alaris comes into contact
with the ala temporalis, but there is no fusion. ‘The position and relations of the lamina
pterygoidea of the ala temporalis might give rise to the suspicion that it represented the
pterygoid cartilage, were it not for the fact that at a later stage the pterygoid cartilage
is present, separate and distinct from the lamina pterygoidea.

Jutting forward from the front of the cochlear capsule is a process of cartilage which
extends towards, but does not reach, the point of contact between ala temporalis and
processus alaris, on cach side. This process is the rudiment of the alicochlear commis-
sure, which will eventually form a complete lateral boundary to the carotid foramen.
This alicochlear commissure is here of particular interest, for it chondrifies from behind
forwards, instead of vice versa, as in the mole.

In the region of the nose, the paired paraseptal cartilages have appeared as separate
and independent strips close to the ventral edge of the nasal septum and to one another.
It is to be noticed that the nasal capsule has as yet neither lamina transversalis anterior
