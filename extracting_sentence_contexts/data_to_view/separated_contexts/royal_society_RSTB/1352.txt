The necessity of combining the experimental and anatomical methods of resea
has never perhaps been so strikingly illustrated as in the nervous system. Its anato
mical investigation has yielded a succession of new results, in the foremost rank o
which stand those obtained by the methods of the two Italians, Marcut and Gorg
The success attending the latter method, in the hands of Ram6n y Cagat, has furnishe
us with a trustworthy plan, which at once enables us better to grasp the workin;
of the nervous system, and to experiment with improved chances of success in a field
which, to use RAMON y CaJAL's words, “in spite of the little happy success that stil
attends the enquirer, must yet be regarded by the anatomist, physiologist, an
pathologist as one of the least known.” The morphological deductions of GAsKELL, and the results obtained by Professo
yoTcH and Horstey with the galvanometer and electrometer have, owing to thei
success, also conduced to new work ; and the few fresh facts which may have com
out in the preceding pages are the direct outcome of questions raised by the last ty
observers. Anatomical Results. The more our anatomical knowledge of the nervous system increases, the more
uniform does the ground plan become.
