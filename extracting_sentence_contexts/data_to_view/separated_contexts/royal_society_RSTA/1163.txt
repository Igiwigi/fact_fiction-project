It was shown in Helled et al. [23] that the inferred flattening of the planets
are inconsistent with the Voyager radio periods, and new rotation periods which are more
consistent with the data have been suggested. With these modified periods (of 16.58h for Uranus
and 17.46h for Neptune) the wind velocities on the two planets are much more similar and are
slower than previously thought. As a result, the wind speeds are not well known but are expected

2In fact, the small difference in masses could be a result of the impacts if indeed Neptune's impact was head-on, leading to
the absorption of the entire impactorâ€™s mass, unlike an oblique impact on Uranus.


to be of the order of a couple 100ms~!. The penetration depths of these winds are unknown, but ls |
are thought to be as deep as 1100 km for both planets, as estimated from their gravity data [45,46]. The atmospheres of both planets are so cold that most volatile species have condensed into 13
clouds far below the visible atmosphere.
