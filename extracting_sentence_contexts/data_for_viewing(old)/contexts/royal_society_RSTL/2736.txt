parts secondarily affected in consequence of the power of sympathy, more or less in-
fluences both systems, all parts being more or less supplied with nerves from both,

But we have sufficient evidence in the phenomena of disease, compared with the

results of the experiments referred to, that here, as in the instances Just pointed
out, the central organs of the sensitive, directly influence those of the vital system.
A sympathetic pain it is well known referred to any part will at length produce
actual inflammation of the part. Now while the pain alone exists, we know that the
derangement, which produces it, is in the central organs alone of the sensitive system,
and in no degree in the part to which it is referred ; and we also know from the facts
which have been stated that there is no channel through which this derangement,
can influence either the neryes or vessels of the part, but through the central organs
of the vital system.

When the affection of the nerves or vessels of the part is the original disease, it
influences the central organs of both systems by the actual disease of the part; but in
the former case there is no other channel of communication than that just referred to.
The central organs of the sensitive, having no power over either the nerves or vessels,
can only influence them through the central organs of the vital system, Thus arises a
double bond of connexion between the two systems, the central organs of the s8en-
sitive system directly influencing those of the vital system, and the nerves of the
sensitive system being necessarily influenced by all deviations from a state of health
