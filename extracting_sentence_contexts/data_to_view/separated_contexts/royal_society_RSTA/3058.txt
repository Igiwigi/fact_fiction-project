The 1.5°C
target has been operationally interpreted as an emissions pathway that meets 1.5°C with some
probability, often 50% or 66% [4] (although a probability is not specified in the Paris agreement). Thus, in addition to providing a possible option for supplementing mitigation trajectories that
are insufficient to meet the 1.5°C goal, the ability to implement solar geoengineering if needed
appears to be the only way to be certain of limiting global average temperature increases to 1.5°C
even if emissions follow proposed 1.5°C-consistent pathways. The prospect of using solar geoengineering to supplement more conventional climate risk
mitigation in reaching a temperature target highlights the fact that global mean temperature
is simply a proxy for a broad collection of climate impacts [25]. It is plausible that solar
geoengineering could meet a temperature target while failing to reduce many of the specific
climate risks that are the implicit goal of any such global temperature target. Based on current knowledge it seems likely that solar geoengineering could reduce many : =
climate risks for most people [26].
