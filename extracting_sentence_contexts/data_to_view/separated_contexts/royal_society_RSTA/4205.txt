Two qualifications are in order. First, I am not saying that Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics
was, or that QM or QFT is, (only) quantum information theory. Heisenberg was concerned with
how fundamental quantum objects and processes work, even though these workings defy being
represented, which fact is an effect of these workings. The information at stake was still about
them, rather than was part of information processing or communication by using quantum
The concept of complementarity, thus formulated, reflects Bohr’s later works, from 1929 on, where the concept is

exemplified, in particular, by the position and the momentum measurements, thus correlatively to the uncertainty relations. See [33] for the development of Bohr’s views and changes in his interpretation.
