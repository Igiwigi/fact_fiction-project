The best delineations I have met with of coagulated blood, are those by G. GuLaverJ. They are to be explained, I believe, by the facts above mentioned: as

often to be seen within them ; they are frequently membranous at the surface ; more
or less spherical in form ; and generally of a deep red colour.
