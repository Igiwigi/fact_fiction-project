discussed for 0.6 wt.% CNC suspensions, is schematically illustrated in figure 9.

It is important to note that, when the oil phase was switched to hexane, the formed emulsions ia
had a lower maximum oil content and stability than those composed of mineral oil. This is because :8
it is more difficult to stabilize hexane than mineral oil in Pickering emulsions owing to the fact
that both the density and viscosity of hexane are lower than those for the mineral oil used in this
work. This is also the reason why the CNC-hexane combination can only form medium internal
phase emulsions that are less stable than the CNCâ€”mineral oil ones.

5. Conclusion

Medium and high internal phase Pickering emulsions stabilized with CNCs were prepared
through a scalable, two-step process.
