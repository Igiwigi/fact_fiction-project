imperfect ; and, from the experience which I have gained during the construction of
this apparatus, T have little hesitation in asserting, that the very nature of the water
battery must prevent the experimentalist from obtaining insulation for any lengthened
period, when such an extended series is employed.

9. In proceeding to describe the effects which this apparatus has presented, I must
endeavour to draw a distinct line of demarcation between the s/atic and the dynamic
effects ; for although these are, in a certain sense, both associated in some forms of
electric development, yet as I have been enabled in a degree to isolate them here, it
is my intention to regard them separately.

10. We know, from the very earliest experiments, that the extremities of a voltaic
pile present opposite electrical states ; it is therefore stating no new fact, to say that
when one extremity of the series is connected with the ground, the other, on being
connected with a gold-leaf electroscope, indicates a high degree of electric tension,
and that the gold leaves diverge with considerable energy. Indeed, in the battery
above described, there was little need of making connection with the ground ; for,
with all my precautions, I found the insulation was in a short time very imperfect,
and that, by this communication with the' earth, a complete circuit, to a certain
extent, already existed. 4

11. As the sfatic effects present themselves antecedently to the dynamic, they
necesarily demand the first notice. The entire battery was connected in one series,
and copper wires from the extreme cells were connected with the plates « and þ of
the double electroscope (fig. 4) ; this instantly produced a considerable and steady
