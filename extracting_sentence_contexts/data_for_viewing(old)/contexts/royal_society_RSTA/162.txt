quantitative evaluation of the results is now underway. The 2008 experiment
followed closely the 2007 model configuration, except for the use of a larger
domain, forecasts initiated at 0000, with a duration of 30 hours and the
assimilation of WSR-88D (NEXRAD) level II data in all but one of the ensemble
members. For additional details, see Xue et al. (2008) and Kong et al. (2008).

Dynamically adaptive weather prediction 899

The verification of forecasts containing explicitly resolved convection poses a
considerable challenge, as noted by Kong et al. (2007a,6), owing to the fact, for
example, that a forecast having zero overlap between a predicted storm and its
real-world counterpart may have significant practical value, yet produce a very
low skill score based on conventional statistical measures. Adding dynamic
adaptation makes verification even more problematic. With these challenges in
mind, results from the experiments described above are being analysed, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, and will be reported in forthcoming papers.

LEAD operates an education and outreach programme (Yalda et al. 2005, 2006;
Clark & Yalda 2006; Clark et al. 2007; Meyers et al. 2007) that seeks to bring
authentic learning experiences to students across a variety of age groups. One
