SOCIETY

Preface

A Scientific Discussion Meeting on Ultra-precision engineering: from physics to
manufacturing took place at the Royal Society on 21-22 March 2011. Some 200
people were present and 14 lectures were presented. This meeting highlighted the
fact that ultra-precision engineering is a multi-disciplinary subject facilitating
the transfer of fundamental physics into technology solutions. Life-enhancing
technologies that harness different principles of physics were shown to demand
extreme levels of accuracy to enable their effective realization.

This Royal Society discussion meeting brought together leading engineers and
scientists from a wide range of disciplines. In combination they highlighted
how critical ultra-precision engineering has become and how its successful
application to science and advanced manufacturing is based on excellence
in fundamental physics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, mechatronics,
metrology, materials processing and bioscience.

A comprehensive review of the evolution of ultra-precision engineering was
