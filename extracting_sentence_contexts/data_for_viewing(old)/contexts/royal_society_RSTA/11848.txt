The investigations of Mr. C, Barrincron Brown have shown that the parent
rock of the famous rubies of Burma (the “ pigeon’s-blood rubies”) is undoubtedly
a highly crystalline limestone which encloses crystals of corundum, spinel, pyrrhotite,
graphite, phogopite, and many other minerals. Equally decisive is the evidence
that he has brought forward to show that the fine red tourmalines (rubellites) of the
same district in Burma do not occur in these limestones in association with the

rubies and spinels, but come from another locality, their parent rock being a gneiss
or schist: The significance of these facts will become apparent when we consider
the association of minerals at other localities where corundum is found in limestone,
as at St. Gothard, in Switzerland, and in the limestone belt of Orange Co., N.Y.,
and Sussex Co., N.J., in the United States,

There are two kinds of evidence which are available in determining the nature
of the minerals associated with the ruby and spinel in Burma. The first and most
satisfactory is derived from examination of the limestones which contain the gems.

= Lhis may be done either by means of thin sections, or by dissolving the limestone in
S Sacid and separating and determining the various insoluble minerals left behind.
3 Nature, however, has done this latter kind of work for us ona grand scale, and in the
= alluvial deposits we find great accumulations of the insoluble minerals which were
