Hence on this account alone the semimenstrual curye of
1837 and 1834 would differ. For instance, for 8 transit, the difference of effect of
declination 17%2 and 20%2 is 6® or 8®; and hence the semimenstrual curyes will de-
viate from each other by such a quantity. Accordingly this feature appears in the
results of the Bristol observations ; and we have in this fact a very remarkable evi-
dence that the effects of declination are discoverable in the tides of each year,

The Bristol observations for 1834, 1835, 1836, and 1837 being reduced, according
to this view, to a common parallax and declination, give the following results, from
which the agreement of different years may be judged of.

* The mean parallax of the different hours of transit is not the same : the greatest parallax occurring near
the syzygies, in consequence of the moon's variation, as I have already observed. Hence the semimenstrual
curve obtained by taking the mean of each hour of transit, requires a correction for parallax to reduce it to the
general mean.
