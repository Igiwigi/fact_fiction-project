It follows from (7.2) that for n =2,3,..., the asymptotic representation of the resonant-wave
envelope, U, satisfies the equation

The fact that the resonant wave expands indicates that its energy outflow from the excitation
point. At n = 2, this mechanical wave behaves similar to heat.

(b) Primitive waveform localized at a line

One day, Prof. Mark Ayzenberg (my PhD student in the past) came with a surprising solution
obtained numerically for a lattice under the action of a point oscillating force. As a result of the
further analysis, we found a localized primitive waveform (LPW) arising at a resonant frequency in
square and triangular two-dimensional lattices [33].

Such an LPW is shown in figure 1, where the particles oscillating in antiphase are marked
by +). The (black) particles in the neighbouring lines are unmoving because there is no action on
them from the (white) particles in the central line.
