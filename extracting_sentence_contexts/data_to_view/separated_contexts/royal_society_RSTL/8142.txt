Thus, on the one hand,
there is a close resemblance between the transverse sections of the bundles in the petioles
of Dichksonia rubiginosa, Pteris umbrosa, Adiantum trapeziforme and macrophyllum, and
Aspidium mole, whilst, on the other, nothing can be more distinct than the vascular
arrangements in Pteris umbross and P. aquitina, in Adiantum trapeziforme and A.
cuneatum, and in numerous other examples of a similar kind which might be quoted. Such being the cas, it is obvious that no guides can well be less trustworthy than trans-
verse sections of these vascular bundles in establishing generic distinction amongst the
fossil ferns. These difficulties are not diminished by the fact that in the fossil petioles the tisswes |

forming the sheath of each bundle, and the elongated cells which are enclosed along with
the vessels, are rarely, if ever, 80 distinctly marked as in the living one. Indeed in

many of them the cortical cells graduate uninterruptedly up to the scalariform vessels,

which latter constitute the only tissue that is sharply differentiated from the cortical
ones ; in other words, such bundles appear to be vascular rather than fibro-vascular. OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 677

Under these cireumstances the question which is forced upon our consideration is a
practical one.
