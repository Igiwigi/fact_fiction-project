generation, so far as they were not obscured by environmental modifications (if these
had been absent the correlation must have been unity in each generation). Genetic
variation has not been detectable, as is shown by the fact that individuals do not
resemble their parents any more closely than they do their great-great-grandparents.
The characteristics of the individuals of each generation are determined, apart from

environment, solely by the characteristics of the genotype of their clone, and not in
any way by the individual characteristics of the parent or any other particular
ancestor. The results are therefore in complete accord with the views of inheritance
in mixed populations upheld by JoHannsEn.

There is another method by which we can determine whether there was any
inheritance of intraclonal variation. The material for this is provided by the fact
that two lines were bred from each clone, so that in each generation a pair of
members of each clone was selected for parentage. We can see therefore whether
the large members of these pairs had larger offspring than the small members
or not.

The number of individuals available for this investigation is less than for the
previous one, owing to the fact that of course all those pairs of which the two
members were of equal size, or of which one died, had to be rejected. The number
left, however, is quite large enough for our purposes. Altogether 135 such pairs
could be utilised for birth measurements and 100 for adult measurements. The
results are given in Table V.
