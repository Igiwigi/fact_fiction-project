of the infrastructure even under the realization of unfavourable scenarios in the long term.
Importantly, the model also recognizes the prolonged construction times of investments such as
conventional plants and long transmission lines (that create a lag between the investment decision
and commissioning time’), as well as the faster installation process of infrastructure such as wind
and solar power units, batteries and FACTS devices (that are assumed to be installed right after
investment decisions have been made).

(b) Problem formulation

Using the notation presented in table 1, we formulate our integrated generation and network
planning problem as a stochastic, mixed-integer linear program. Note that, for unit consistency,
some variables and parameters are expressed in per unit (pu), and hourly time periods are
considered in the operation.

(i) Long-term uncertainty

Long-term uncertainty is modelled through a multi-stage scenario tree (figure 1), which describes
