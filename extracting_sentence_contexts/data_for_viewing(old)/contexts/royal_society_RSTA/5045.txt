Maxwell states that he

... preferred to seek an explanation of the fact in another direction, by supposing them to
be produced by actions which go on in the surrounding medium as well as in the excited
bodies ...

(3) The theory I propose may therefore be called a theory of the Electromagnetic Field, because
it has to do with the space in the neighbourhood of the electric and magnetic bodies, and it
may be called a Dynamical Theory, because it assumes that in that space there is matter in
motion, by which the observed electromagnetic phenomena are produced.

Central to his theory was the elasticity of the medium through which electromagnetic
phenomena are to be propagated, leading to the concept of the displacement current as a necessary
part of the theoretical apparatus. Equally important is the formalization of the processes of
electromagnetic induction that can produce currents—these can result in dissipative energy loss
