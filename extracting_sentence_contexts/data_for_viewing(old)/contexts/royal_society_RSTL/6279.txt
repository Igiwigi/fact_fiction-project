The appearance of ozone at the positive pole in the electrolysis of water, and its
formation by the agency of 80 active a body as ordinary phosphorus, do not seem
unfavourable to its being the result of decomposition. But the same observation will
not apply to its production by the action of acids on such bodies as the peroxide of
barium. We certainly should not haye expected to sce a body derived from the decom-

position of oxygen produced under tho latter circumstances, and, although the facts
connected with its production in these cases have not been studied with precision, yet
there appears to be no doubt that ozone is actually formed.

We must in conclusion add, that the few attempts we have made to isolate either of
the supposed constituents of oxygen have failed.

We are still continuing to prosecute this inquiry, and hope on a future occasion to
lay before the Society the results of further experiments which are now in progress.
