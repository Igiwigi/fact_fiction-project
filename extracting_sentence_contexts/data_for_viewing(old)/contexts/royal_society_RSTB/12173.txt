advocate’s side, there are published papers like ‘The mind of
plants: thinking the unthinkable’ [62] and ‘Plants learn and
remember: let’s get used to it.’ [63]. On the detractor’s side,
there are titles like ‘Plant neurobiology: no brain, no gain?’
[64] as well as the (rather unkind) ‘Plant neurobiology: intelli-
gent plants or stupid studies?’ [65]. Even in light of all the
disagreements that plant neurobiology as a field of study

triggers in its detractors, the undeniable reality is that plants
do display behaviour. They also seem to be able to display
phenomena very much like memory and learning, and without
a doubt, they do react to their environment. These are uncon-
tested facts that virtually everyone in the scientific
community accepts; I know of no exceptions. A thorough dis-
cussion of how this field came to be is outside the scope of this
review, but there are a few excellent articles that explore this
story in detail [66—70]. One thing is for sure, these are exciting
times for the brain sciences and | fully anticipate significant
breakthroughs in the near future.

The final examples of atypical brain-like function that I
will briefly mention here will illustrate the notion that to
functionally redefine the brain as a single, static, and macro-
scopic structure is a near impossible proposition. Some of
these examples are explored in much more detail in other
