sample JH. This sample represents an endolithic colonization from extreme dry Atacama Desert
in the form of condensed green layer close to the sample surface. In that case, bands of carotenoid
(1527, 1154cm7!) and also chlorophyll (1326, 915, 747 cm~1) were registered. Raman features
of pigments were detected only after positioning and focusing on parts with high density of
algal colonization. In fact, this was the only case in this study when organic Raman bands were
registered also using the 785nm laser. No bands owing to organics were detected within the
powdered JH sample. On the other hand, the 785nm laser showed better S/N ratio for the
detection of sulfate/carbonate mineral matrix in the cases when the fluorescence background
was at reasonable level (figure 2).

A strong fluorescence background was registered when employing the 785nm laser for
analysis of pigmented crusts from the Mojave salt lakes. In fact, this is considered to be the
main reason for no carotenoid Raman bands being detected within these samples using this
laser wavelength. The spectra achieved by the spectrometer equipped with the 532 nm excitation
source also have fluorescence background (see the comparison of the raw and baseline-corrected
spectra for the both laser lines in figure 3). Nevertheless, its intensity is lower compared with
that observed at 785 nm, which together with the attendant resonance Raman enhancement of the
