The maximum pressure, therefore, at Madras occurred at the same hour annually
and within a range from the 5th of December to the 24th of January; and the
minimum pressure occurred between 3* 41” and 4* 41” p.,., and within the range
of ten days between the 21st of May and 1st of June. The maximum pressure at
Dodabetta, in 1847, was on the 17th of March, instead of December or January, as at
Madras, but the minimum occurred in June, as at Madras. The Poona maximum
was in January and the minimum in July ; at Bombay, in 1843, the maximum pres-
sure occurred on the same day and the same hour as at Madras, and the minimum
pressure occurred equally in May, but on the 16th instead of the 21st of May. These
facts Dr. Butsr recorded in a series of meteorological observations, taken hourly in
Bombay for the year 1843, on the opposite side of the peninsula from Madras ; and in
his tables it is stated that the maximum pressure of the atmosphere, 30-136, occurred
on the 24th of January at 10 a.m., and the minimum pressure, 29-431, on the 16th of
May, before the monsoon set in, at 4 Þ..; the extreme range therefore being 0-705,
while the extreme range at Madras in that year was 0-952, but the mean of the five
years at Madras was 0'735. In Bombay, in 1844, the range was *661 from 30119 on
the 13th of January to 29-458 on the 4th of June. At Calcutta unfortunately the obser-
vations were not taken hourly, and exact data are not attainable; but the record in
1846 8tates that the maximum pressure occurred on the 12th of January at 9* 50” a.m.,
viz. 30'225, and the minimum on the 25th of July at 4 y.w. 29-356, the annual range
therefore 0:869. In 1847 the barometer stood highest on the 5th of February at 9" 50”,
being 30-169, and the least pressure was on the 25th of May, at sunset, 29*310, the
