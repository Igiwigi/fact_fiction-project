TRON AND STEEL IN A ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELD. 723

Be?
alternating magnetic field = 1Â°67 10%)? the difference in the constant being due to

the fact that the distribution of E.M.F. is different in the two cases, the ay erage
being larger for the rotating field, and also that in the latter the av erage length of
path and resistance of the eddy current circuits are smaller. It is more Sods Bad to estimate the loss due to eddy currents in ergs per

ent? pe ergs per cub.
