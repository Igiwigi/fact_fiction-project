366 DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

for m = 6 to be ‘716474, and this is 23931 below the observed denominator for D, (5).
Now, 508 = 23850, which is the same as the difference for m = 4 and 5 instead of
being less, as analogy with others would lead us to expect. But the observation
errors are large (maximum of order 183, about) so that room’ is allowed for this.
There would then be one step from m = 5 to 6 of something less than 503 combined
with a collateral displacement of (+20,) on D(c). To indicate the explanation this is
entered in the table, a difference of 503 making the denominator for D (6) = 6°716653.
The observed abnormality as between D,,(6) and D,,—v=D,,(6) is that the wave
number of D,, is 1°26 less than D,,, whereas it should be 8 or 9 greater, with a
denominator about 32d greater instead of 1721 less. There is, in fact, a further
defect beyond the normal value of about 36d. Thus, if the difference for D, (5, 6) is
x6, that of D, (5,6) is (w+386)0d. The lines would then be represented as follows :—

d= 700767, d, = ‘740508,
Dy (6) = (26,) D(©)—N/{6 +d,—(x+36) 5},
D, (m) = (28,) D(%)—N/{(m+d,—28)}*.

The collateral addition intensifies D, and explains its continuance, but in D, the
increase, owing to addition of 23, to D( ©), is overweighted by the diminution of the
excess 863 in the VD part, and so, after the first, the rest are too faint to observe.
At least, that is a suggestion of a possible explanation.
