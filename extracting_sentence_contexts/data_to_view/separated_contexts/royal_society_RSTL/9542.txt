: by introducing an air-spark. lf a tube of very moderate exhaust be placed in circuit with a large HoLTz machine,
Sand an air-spark of considerable size be introduced into any part of the circuit, it will
generally be found that phosphorescence appears in the neighbourhood of the negative
-Sterminal, even though there was not the slightest appearance of it while the discharge
'Swas passing continuously. This is clearly due to the fact that intermittent discharges
"are necessarily much more violent during the very short period of time which they
= occupy than are continuous discharges ; and hence the velocity imparted to the mole-
'Seular streams is sufficient to make them impinge on the glass with the velocity requisite
<=to produce phosphorescence. TI will be noticed that we have here no change in the
Z degree of exhaustion, but only in the violence of the discharge ; and it is further to be
Qremarked that this increased violence can be obtained, either directly as in the case
â€” of the negative air-spark, or by way of response to a violent positive discharge in
- the tube, as in the case of the poxitive air-spark. *
