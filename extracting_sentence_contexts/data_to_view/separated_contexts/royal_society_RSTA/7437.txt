It will be noticed that the interchange of 7
and j interchanges these forms in pairs (A, B,), (A; Bh), (Cys Dn)s (Cis Drs (Ens Fu), (Ens Fn),
(G,, G,,), (H,, H7,), where n,m = 1,2 and n-+m. In the forms of § 10 replace x by é, j by /, g by j, and u by yj,. Then the forms containing
the factor u, clearly reduce, and we have in fact

L,=0, 1,50, L;=D, L,=D,; M,=Ci, M,=C;, M;=Gi, M,=G;
WN, =4, Ne =A, No = 2, My = dre l Ved (ok =e ew SX |W SA

Now these forms satisfy the conditions for the invariant reduction (10-5). These relations,
together with the fact that L,, L,, P, are all = 0, imply
