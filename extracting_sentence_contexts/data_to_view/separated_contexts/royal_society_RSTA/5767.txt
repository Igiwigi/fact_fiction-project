This is because if Q is sufficiently large this class is not contained in the family of (U(1)-
symmetric) perturbations of Kasner solutions studied in [10], even if A =0; this is in contrast
with our stability results in [24], which are covered by the work in [10]. The reason that the
stability results established in this paper are not covered by those from [10] is because in that
article, the perturbations are required to have a hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector field
that is close to one of the distinct eigenvector fields, say X, of go), As discussed above, the
hypersurface orthogonal vector field of our perturbations g in case 1 is in general an arbitrary
linear combination of the distinct eigenvector fields X and Y of g*). The fact that this linear
combination depends on the value of Q according to (2.15) is our main motivation to employ
the more general Qconst.-areal gauge as opposed to the Qo-areal gauge which we use in [24]. We also note that, similar to the standard Kasner solutions in [24], the A-Kasner solutions
discussed here have six natural isometries that preserve the form of the metric and map between
different values of K. Each of these six isometries is defined as a map that swaps a pair of spatial
coordinates.
