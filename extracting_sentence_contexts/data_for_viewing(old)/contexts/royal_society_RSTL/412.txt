174 Mr. Knox on some phenomena of colours,

formed by the two sets of primaries, that angle was always
bisected by the central band of the 'intersectionaries. '' And
although these latter evidently proceed from the crossings' of
the two sets of primaries, yet they are never continued through
those crossings to the opposite angle at A, fig. 6, (pl. VIIL)
nor could they be made to appear in any angle formed by
primary fringes, unless the said fringes were s0'disposed as to
have their red sides turned inwards, or towards each other.
This remarkable fact was proved by several repetitions of the
same experiment.

Ezp. 15. In the course of making these experiments, I had
accidentally left a single slip of 'glass on one of the pairs be-
tween which a set of primaries were formed, without any
other pressure than its own weight ;| on examining the appara-
tus a few minutes afterwards, I was agreeably surprised to
find no less than four sets of the same' kind. of fringes which
appeared in the angle between the two sets of primaries, as
before related in Experiment 12, almost parallel to each other,
and nearly 80 to the primaries, and-at/ about an inch distant
in front thereof. (see fig. 5: pl. VII) The set 'marked 2,
