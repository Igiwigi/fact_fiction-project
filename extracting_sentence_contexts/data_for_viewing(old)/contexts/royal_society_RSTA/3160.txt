See figure 1 for an example of a numerically obtained stable pinned 1-pulse solution supported
by the scalar version of (1.3). The fact that all eigenvalues of a pinned n-pulse solution of the
scalar version of (1.3) are real-valued stems from the fact that the associated stability problem is
a Sturm-Liouville problem ([27], e.g.). A direct consequence is that, unlike their counterparts in
two-component slow-fast RDEs ([24], e.g.), pinned n-pulse solutions of the scalar version of (1.3)
cannot undergo Hopf bifurcations. A straightforward computation also shows that the matrix
M(0) (1.6) is non-invertible if and only if {ayy is a degenerate solution of (1.5). So, upon changing
a system parameter, a stable pinned n-pulse solution and unstable pinned n-pulse solution
generically merge and disappear in a saddle-node bifurcation when 4 =0 is an eigenvalue (of
both pinned 1-pulse solutions), see, for example, §2a(i) and figure 1. Or, alternatively, a stable
pinned 1-pulse solution and unstable pinned n-pulse solution merge and exchange stability via
a transcritical bifurcation when 4 =0 is an eigenvalue. In §2, we first introduce the geometrical
singular perturbation framework to study the existence and stability of pulse solutions supported
by (1.3) for N=1 and n=1. As it turns out, the linearity of (1.3) away from the localized
