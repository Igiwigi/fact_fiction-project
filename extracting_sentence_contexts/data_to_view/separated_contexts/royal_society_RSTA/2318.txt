The direction is (by exception in the series) in front of the normal, away from the
axis ¢, MurMAnn and Rorrer observed the same fact and found the angle from the
normal 2° 33’,

As the axial angle ac = 73° 51, this direction, which is that of the first and not the
second median line (the double refraction being
negative), is 18° 47’ from (in front of) the vertical
axis c, and the other extine¢tion in the symmetry
plane is 2° 38’ from (below) the axis a. The two
mutually perpendicular extinction directions in the
symmetry plane are thus not both in the obtuse
angle of the morphological axes ae (as is the case in
other groups than the copper group). The positions
of the four optical ellipsoids of the copper group
of salts are given in the next table, and expressed
in fig.
