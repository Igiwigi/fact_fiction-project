and Mouse (fig. 80.). In those Birds that
have been examined, the irritability has 80 speedily ceased, that no contraction has
been observed. It is almost unnecessary to remark how completely the variety before noticed in
the proximity of the strize in all animals in contiguous and even the same fasciculi,
is illustrated and explained by the foregoing facts. Such are the principal phenomena observed during that form of contraction which
I conceive to be analogous to the rigor mortis*; but it is undoubtedly necessary to
bear in mind, that the fasciculi in which they occur are in a condition very different
from those acting in the living body under the influence of volition. It is not by
any means intended to be implied, that the healthy movements of muscle are in every
respect such as have been now described; but it seems highly probable, that in kind,
at least, they are identical with them.
