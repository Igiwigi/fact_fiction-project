However, they are less sensitive to the contrast property (see
the electronic supplementary material, figure S4 for an
example). Secondly, contrast-based methods assume that
periodicity in the signal is driven by transient features (such
as high-amplitude bursts) that differ within narrow time win-
dows centred on- versus off- pulse positions [74,79,80].
However, these measures might be less sensitive to fine tem-
poral regularity (see the electronic supplementary material,
figure S4). Finally, a third family of measures include autocor-
relation (based on high self-similarity of a periodic signal when
shifted by time equivalent to the pulse period) ([72]; see the
electronic supplementary material, figures S4 and S5) and fre-
quency-tagging (based on the fact that periodic recurrence in a
signal can be identified in the frequency domain as narrow-
band peaks of energy centred at the frequencies corresponding
to the pulse period and its harmonics) [29,81].

These different methods and their respective assumptions,
advantages and pitfalls are illustrated and further discussed
in the electronic supplementary material, figure S4. In order
to make valid conclusions about pulse prominence, it is
crucial to consider these strengths and weaknesses, as well
as the nature of the analysed signals. In many cases, the differ-
ent measures might be used in a complementary way to
provide better insight into pulse representation within a
