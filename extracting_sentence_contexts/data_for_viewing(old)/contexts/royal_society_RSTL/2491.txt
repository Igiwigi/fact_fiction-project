dead blood may be changed from venous to arterial, eyen through a dead mem-
brane.

This power which gases possess of acting on each other is in some respects similar
to that which takes place in fluids, and which has been described by DuTrocuer
under the name of endosmosis and exosmosis. In the experiments detailed by this
philosopher the interyening septum is supposed to contribute materially to the phe-
nomena. In the experiments with gases the intervening membrane does not prevent,
but it does not contribute to, the change. But independent of this, the existence of
this power in gases was not known to DuTrocner until after the fact had been fully
ascertained by others. Mr. Darrox many years ago proved that hydrogen possessed
the power of penetrating or mixing with carbonic acid in opposition to gravity ; that
oxygen possesses the same property, but in a higher degree, I ascertained in the
island of St. Thomas in 1827. TI afterwards made experiments on a larger scale, in
1830, at the high rock of Saratoga, where there is an atmosphere of natural carbonic
acid; and the result was communicated to many physicians in America previously
to any of the American publications on the snbject.

It is now more than probable that the changes which Lavors1ts believed to occur

'in the lungs take place in reality inthe extreme circulation. Some later writers
have assnmed that the elements of carbonic acid exist in the blood, and that its for-
