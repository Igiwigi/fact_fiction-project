Historically science has often appealed to the principle of Occam’s razor, which : =
suggests that if several equally valid explanations are on offer, then the simplest should be chosen. : S
Yet what if simple explanations offer no ability to predict? It is not clear if machines should be built : 2
to resemble humans [71], looking for simple overarching frameworks. In fact a basic usage of 14
computing is to keep track of many more very complex structures than we are able to as humans. : _

Without the simplicity of Occam’s razor encouraging us to see a simple relationship between a 4
few variables, it is also hard to understand what to do with unusual observations. Often in large : =
populations it is easier to find outliers lying far from the main body of observations, and involving : 3
ranges of predictors that no other observations involve. Very little can be guaranteed about : &

predictive or statistical performance when this is true.
