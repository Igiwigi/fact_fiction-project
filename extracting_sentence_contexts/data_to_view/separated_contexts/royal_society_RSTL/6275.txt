I have made no reference in this communication to feeble currents, which are
possibly at all times to be collected from the earth, and in which a periodicity has been
traced, but have strictly confined myself to the larger disturbances, the concomitants of
« Magnetic Storms.” Nor have I made any attempt to trace the origin of these earthe
currents, or to offer any theoretical views thereon. I find current-electricity Non the
earth in a very marked degree at certain times; I simply take it as I find it, and
endeayour to arrange the facts in some degree of order, 80 as to throw a little more
light than we have heretofore possessed upon these interesting phenomena. I have
touched very lightly upon terrestrial magnetism, and haye given no Suggeation as to
the probable causes of disturbance, save in the one case that necessarily arises out of
the present inquiry. Other influences than those exerted by electric currents upon
magnets may or may not be in play; but one thing is very certain, that at least a large
portion of the motion presented by the magnetometers on storm-days is connected with
the then prevalence of earth-currents; and doubtless some portion of all the more
regular and less violent disturbances may be more or less due to the same causes.
