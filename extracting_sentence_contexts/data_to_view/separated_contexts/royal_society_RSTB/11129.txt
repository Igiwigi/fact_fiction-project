In less-connected net-
works, information travels slower so that fewer individuals
will be exposed to novel adaptive cultural traits. Experimen-
tal studies of cultural evolution demonstrated that cultural
traits are more likely to become deteriorated, or even lost,
when groups of cultural learners are small [9,11]. These facts suggest that population fragmentation is a
double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows the pro-
duction of more complex cultural traits, and on the other
hand, it restrains populationsâ€™ ability to maintain these
traits. This suggests that for any given population size,
there should be an intermediate level of fragmentation that
maximizes cumulative cultural evolution, by balancing
cultural loss and cultural diversity.
