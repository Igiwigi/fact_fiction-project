(b) Motion management

Motion can affect PET-MRI imaging in many different ways. It reduces resolution and
creates artefacts which pose a burden for accurate diagnosis [9,16]. Furthermore, it degrades
quantification, which is an important issue when used for disease grading and may directly
impact treatment planning and response assessment. All these limitations can be controlled by
addressing each type of motion properly and many strategies have been implemented for this
purpose as shown in figure 1. Moreover, it is worth highlighting a somewhat counterintuitive
fact: motion can improve the imaging system resolution because it increases spatial sampling. For
example, a tiny rotation (equal to half the size of the crystal) of PET scanners was commonly
applied in the past for increasing the spatial sampling and consequently the resolution [17].
Therefore, proper motion management can help increase the resolution of the imaging system
due to improved sampling, compared to motion-less acquisitions, an effect also referred to as
super-resolution [18].

A traditional method to achieve image capture without motion artefacts is asking the subject
not to move, e.g. hold their breath. This is common practice in X-ray or CT scanning and less
common in MRI [19]. In PET imaging, currently this is not the case, though it may well become in
the future if scanner sensitivity increases substantially. For example, it has been shown that PET
images of reasonable quality can be captured within 30s per bed position with a recent time of
flight PET/CT scanner [20]. However, in the near future, we do not anticipate this to be the way
