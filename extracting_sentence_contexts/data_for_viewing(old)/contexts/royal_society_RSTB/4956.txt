small fossil Crustaceans which also give very many structural details.

The earliest of these is the description of the Ostracod Palwocypris edwardsti by C. Bronantart (1876).
Fourteen specimens of this minute species, the shells of which are only about ;4;inch (4 mm.) long, were
found in a section of a silicified fruit of Cardiocarpus from the Coal Measures of St. Etienne. The animals
had evidently obtained access to the interior through a crack while the fruit was floating in the water. The
state of preservation was extremely good, for Bronenrart was able to make out many of the appendages,
and even shows in one of his figures the feathering on some of the sete with a magnification, apparently, of
about 300.

The second is that of the Conchostracan Limnestheria ardra by Manu C. Wricut (1920). The specimens
of this species were found in material from a boring in the Kilkenny Coal Measures, and the shells measured
1 inch to } inch (5-6 mm.) in length. In spite of the fact that the rock in which these animals were found
was a dark, opaque shale, many important details of structure—e.g., antennw, mandibles, claspers of the
male, furca, &c.—could be made out quite clearly,
