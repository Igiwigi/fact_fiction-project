THE CERVICAL AND UPPER THORACIC SYMPATHETIC FIBRES. 119

in the corresponding grey rami of different animals appears to me to vary consider-
ably. Whilst making experimeuts upon the effects of stimulating the lower lumbar
sympathetic, I usually teased out the grey rami, either fresh or in osmic acid ; in some
cases I found large numbers of small medullated nerves. It is true that in the grey
rami, which I have since hardened and cut, the small medullated fibres have been
scattered and few, varying from about ten to twenty-five ; but their occasional presence
in quantity, in circumstances which do not seem to me to leave open any source of error,
leads me to doubt whether a medullated fibre, after passing through a sympathetic
cell—using this expression for convenience—is necessarily non-medullated. And
this doubt is strengthened by some other facts. In the Frog, the rami communi-
eantes of the lower lumbar nerves consist almost entirely of medullated nerves, and
I do not find any grey rami; most, at any rate, of these medullated fibres are
connected with nerve-cells in the sympathetic ganglia. Further, it will be remem-
bered that Brpper and VoLKMANN described the short ciliary nerves as being free
from interstitial tissue, z.e., from non-medullated fibres, so that the small medullated
nerve-fibres pass through the ciliary ganglion without losing their medulla—a fact
which has been confirmed by several observers, and recently by GASKELL.

Whilst speaking of the loss of medulla by a nerve, there is angther point it is, perhaps, worth while to
mention, It is very commonly assumed that sympathetic nerve-fibres, after being connected with nerve-
cells in any one sympathetic ganglion, pass on and are again connected with nerve cells in one or more
sympathetic ganglia, This view has been taken for various reasons, and, amongst others, because
