reasonable to ascribe them to the living forces residing in them,
—to the never-ceasing motions of their constituent particles, —
than to suppose them to be derived from their want of power,
and their total indifference to motion and to rest.
No reasonable objection against this hypothesis, (of the in»
cessant motions of the constituent particles of all bodies,) founded
on a supposition that there is not room sufficient for these

motions, can be advanced; for we have abundant reason to
conclude, that if there be in fact any indivisible solid particles
of matter, (which however is very problematical,) these particles
must be 80 extremely small, compared to the spaces they occupy,
that there must be ample room for all kinds of motions among
them.

And, whatever the nature or directions of these internal mo-
tions may be, among the constituent particles of a. solid body, as
long as these constituent particles, in their motions, do not
break loose from the systems to/ which they belong, (and to
which they are attached by gravitation,) and run wild in the
vast void by which each system is bounded, (which, as long as
the known laws of nature exist, is no doubt impossible,) the
