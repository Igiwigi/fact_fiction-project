The background calculation in the regional inversions (FLEXINVERT and FLEXKF) is another
source of uncertainty and may at least partly explain why the results of these inversions differ in
their estimates for the EU27 + UK region. Comparisons of the background and observed CH4
mole fractions for observation times when the contribution from fluxes within the European
domain is close to zero (defined as when the absolute difference between the prior modelled
and background mole fraction is less than 5 ppb) suggest that the background in FLEXINVERT
is underestimated by an average of —18 ppb (standard deviation of 15 ppb) compared to —7 ppb
(standard deviation of 15 ppb) in FLEXKF, which could mean FLEXINVERT has a positive bias
for the flux estimate over Europe (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). The fact that
FLEXKF used TM5-4DVAR output to determine the background means that both FLEXKF and
TM5-4DVAR have the same budget of CHy entering into the European domain via atmospheric
transport.

(b) Anomalies in 2018

The annual and seasonal CHy flux anomalies in 2018 with respect to the mean for 2005-2017 are
shown in figure 5. A positive anomaly in the annual mean is seen in three of the inversions (but
not in CTE) over the Netherlands and northwest Germany, but is only significant (i.e. outside
two standard deviations of the mean) in FLEXINVERT. A positive annual anomaly is also seen
over Serbia.
