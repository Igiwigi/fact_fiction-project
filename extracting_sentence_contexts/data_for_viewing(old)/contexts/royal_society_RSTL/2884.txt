obtained from the same place, which I have repeatedly received from my friend
Mr. BowERBAXK, I have been enabled to continue the investigation beyond the limits
that a mere temporary visit to the coast would have enabled me to do.

During the early part of these investigations I was but little acquainted with the
observations that had already been made by others upon the subject. But having
since been necessarily led to consult these, I find some of my own investigations in
various degrees confirmed. Those points therefore that are not new I have either
wholly omitted, or touched upon only to the extent that would be necessary to render
the subject intelligible.

The facts that I have thought the most interesting and important to be stated are
embodied in the descriptions of the various species that furnish the subject matter of
the present memoir. 'Two of these species I believe to be entirely new, and I have
ventured to name them accordingly.

A few particulars with regard to the method that I have pursued may not be
