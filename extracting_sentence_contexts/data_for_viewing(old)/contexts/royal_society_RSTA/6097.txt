The quantities (K2)1, (K2)2, ...may now be found as expressions in 0, using (3.4) and its successor
equations. These present no difficulty to Mathematica, and are the basic ingredients for the further
series expansions developed in the rest of the paper.

In (3.3), if Kco increases from 0 to 1/ /2, the corresponding value of 0? decreases from 1 to 0.
Hence in the range —1 < ) <1, equation (3.3) defines a symmetric non-negative function K,9(i)
which has a maximum value K,9 = 1//2 at ) = 0, and descends to K,y = 0 at ) = +1. These values
agree with K,9 as determined by (3.5). In the original variables (v, €), the function K,9(+) becomes
K.o(/12v/e), which is self-similar, so that the series (3.2) has the property of leading-order self-
similarity. Thus one advantage of the variable ) now becomes apparent: it is the self-similarity
parameter in situations where the leading-order approximation is good enough. If K- is regarded
as a function of v rather than j, the maximum is still 1//2, but the relevant range becomes |v| <
e/V12. The fact that K’,, =0 at 5 =0, or equivalently at v = 0, is used in later series expansions.

For plotting, we use instead of (3.2), the alternative form

K, =K¢(6,€) = Keo(d) + €Ker() + €7Ke2(8) +... (3.6)
where
(K2)1 (K2).  {(K2)1}?

Here, K-9 and K,2 are even, and K, is odd. Note that (K2), x KR and (K2)2 x K2,. Figure 3a,d shows
successive truncations of (3.6) to order 1, € and €? for « =0.25 (a) and € =0.5 (d). Convergence is
rapid: the series up to orders ¢ and ¢? are almost indistinguishable on the scale of the plots. The
