During the later periods, the product of solution drops into the inci-
pient loops of the blood-yessels, and s0 circulates for purposes of nutrition. This is
an instance of primary lymphatic absorption, and differs in no- essential particular
from the same process in the animal further advanced. We may consider the blas-
toderma in fact, during the first period of its circulation, as containing very numerous
lymphatic ducts, instead of a few, as in the-more perfect animal. In the blastoderma, the process by which nutrient matter passes into the circnla-
tion, or the act of absorption, as it is usually called, is reduced to its most simple
form, being contemporaneous and also identical with the formation of the imperfect
capillary network. In the more advanced animal, when the capillary network is
consolidated, the product of 8olution of the textures passes or drops into the inter-
cellular or textural lacunz, which appear to be the radicles of the lymphatic system;
a system which in the adult, communicates with the blood-vessels only at a few places
