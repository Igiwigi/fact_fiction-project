It may be useful to state the different kinds of absorption with which we have met.
1st. General absorption from the least refrangible end.

2nd. Special absorptions both edges sharply defined.
Bands {mo edge sharply defined.
both edges not sharply defined.

Regarding the general absorption we have nothing very noteworthy to remark,
beyond the fact that as a rule in the hydrocarbons of the same series those of heayier
molecular constitution seem to have less than those of lighter.

In regard to the special absorptions we may say that it is very often easy to distin-
guish the position of lines at the edges of bands, though they are not sufficiently
marked to be represented on the map. This is more noteworthy, when we have a
change from a very dense absorption to a feebler one. The impression left on the
mind is that in reality these particular bands are made up of lines of different
intensities, bub of this we cannot speak with authority.

As to the possibility of any of these special absorptions being due to the carbon
vapour, &c., of the are, it will, we think, be sufficient to state that, as we do not find
any trace of them in photographs taken without a liquid in front of the slit, we are
