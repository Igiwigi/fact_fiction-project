impossible that the fecundating fluid could be conveyed into
the uterus; and yet in several of these cases impregnation had
really taken place. It would be digressing too much to state
the facts in detail, sceing that in this inquiry I deduce nothing
from them; nor would such statement solve the problem be-
fore us. The facts are already in the possession of physiolo-
gists, but are not admitted as satisfactory proofs. Those who
hold the contrary opinion, either cavil at the accuracy of the
Statement, or draw a different conclusion; therefore to attempt
conviction by these materials would be to engage in the service
of forlorn hope. It remains then to try whether by a patient
experimental investigation, we can make such an accession of
new facts to our present stock of knowledge as will enable us
to unloose this Gordian knot. This attempt naturally leads us
to review the two points of the question, viz. 1s the passage of
the semen by the tubes to the ovaries, essential to impregnation ?
Tf not, what other means are employed ?

If it be true that the fecundating fluid must pass by the tubes
to the ovaries before impregnation can take place, ought it not
