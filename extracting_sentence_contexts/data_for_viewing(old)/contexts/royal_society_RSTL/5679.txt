at * a centralization of the neryous ganglia is true cephalization.”
: It is true that in the Spider-crabs there exists no hollow Space in the centre of the
Zonsolidated ganglia; but those which are thus consolidated homologize with the sepa-
ate ganglia that supply the limbs of the animal with nerves, not with those ganglia that
Supply the organs that are endowed with the power of sensation.
2 This idea receives support from the known characters of the respective animals. The
Fortune of which the Carcimus is placed as the highest form, are active and vivacious
Freatures, whereas the Leptopodiade are inanimate and sluggish, fulfilling in their habits
he existence of the fakirs of eastern tradition; they continue 80 long without move-
Ment, that weeds take root upon their surface, the growth of which prevents them from
Seing distinguished from the swrrounding objects.
FE Again, the general littoral character of the Portunide, and of Carcinus in particular—
Mich differs not widely in form from the terrestrial Geg garcinus—together with the fact
Ihat all the Leptopodiade are deep-sea genera, is in accordance with the doctrine laid
own by Professor Agass1z, that all land and fresghwater animals assume a higher and
Inore perfect form than their allied types of the ocean.
