of Archegoniate plants, that spore-production is not in all cases strictly limited to,
or defined by pre-ordained formative cells, or cell-groups. This position, based as
it is on the facts observed, is one which harmonises readily with a theory of sterilisation,
as applied to the evolution of the sporophyte.

VorcuttxG has formulated the proposition that “no living vegetative cell of the
plant-body, which is capable of growth, has a specific and unalterable function.”+
This thesis in its most general sense should be extended so as to include also
sporogenous cells ; for, as we have seen, many cases can be cited of the conversion of
cells which are sporogenous to a vegetative condition, and occasionally the converse.
But both VorcurinG, and Prerrer.{ in discussing this equipotentiality of embryonic
cells, and the influences which determine their development, have restricted - the
discussion chiefly to the vegetative organs. The facts before us show, however, that
vegetative and sporogenous cells are not things apart, or essentially different, but
that they are on occasions mutually convertible. The influences, external or internal,
which act upon the embryonic cell, and determine whether it shall be vegetative or
sporogenous, are still obscure; but clearly they act within restricted limits, for in
vascular plants neither superficial cells of the plant-body, nor deeply seated cells have
ever been found to develop as spore-mother-cells.

The conversion of potentially fertile cells into vegetative tissue was recognised by
Ncert, and embodied by him in his fundamental law of organic development, as
follows : ‘‘ The phenomenon of reproduction of one stage becomes at a higher stage that
of vegetation. The cells which in the simpler plant are set free as germs, and constitute
the initials of new individuals, become in the next higher plant part of the individual
