These observations have motivated a research program focused on probing the sharpness :8
of a number of key estimates, both instantaneous as in (1.10) and finite-time as in (1.11), in the : Ss
one-dimensional Burgers and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes systems, in addition to examining :s
estimates (1.10)-(1.11) and more recently the Ladyzhenskaya—Prodi-—Serrin criterion (1.7) in three- 1h

dimensional Navier-Stokes flows. Progress in this research program was largely enabled by the
development of robust computational approaches for the solution of large-scale PDE-constrained
optimization problems. Since a number of important milestones have recently been attained in
this research program, the present review paper aims to survey these developments.

Most of the optimization problems considered here are non-convex, hence their solutions
found numerically based on local optimality conditions are local maximizers only. Thus, unless
stated otherwise, when we refer to ‘maximizing solutions’ defined with arg max we will in fact
mean local maximizers. Theoretical results concerning the existence of (possibly non-unique)
solutions to optimization problems involving different hydrodynamic PDE models are available
in the literature, which includes the seminal study [58] and the monographs [59-61].

The structure of the paper is as follows: in the next three sections, we review instantaneous and
finite-time energy-type estimates known for the one-dimensional Burgers, two-dimensional and
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes systems, and discuss different optimization problems that have
been introduced to test their sharpness before presenting some key results (in §2 devoted to the
one-dimensional Burgers equation we also provide comments about the corresponding stochastic
problem and the system with fractional dissipation); in §5, we draw some connections to other
research problems concerned with establishing bounds on the behaviour of hydrodynamic
models such as the background method and the methods based on sum-of-squares (SOS)
