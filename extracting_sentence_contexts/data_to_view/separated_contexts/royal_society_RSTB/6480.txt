It is difficult to see that this fact
carries any weight at all without a great deal of confirmatory evidence. Characteristic
functions of the Craniate liver are the storage of glycogen and to a less extent of fat,
the regulation of urea content, and the excretion of bile pigments. With regard to the
existence of the latter in Amphioxus it is impossible to state anything definite in the
absence of experimental evidence, but their occurrence is unlikely in view of the fact
that the blood is colourless. Similarly, there appears to be no evidence with regard
to the nitrogen metabolism, and this aspect of the problem clearly demands investiga-
tion. However, even if the diverticulum were shown to be concerned in the regulation
of urea, this would not be conclusive, for there is reason to believe that in Scyllium
canicula the liver is not the only source of urea (NEEDHAM and NEEDHAM 1930).
