Adrian Sutton I completely agree with you in bec metals. The problem I see with
that as a general explanation is that, in fcc metals, we also see
plasticity at liquid helium temperatures [10]. That’s not compatible
with a kink mechanism. The Peierls barrier to dislocation motion in
fcc metals (for instance, aluminium) is not so high that you need a
kink mechanism. And yet you can still see hydrogen embrittlement in
aluminium and aluminum alloys [22]. So I think there’s something more
generic.

Reiner Kirchheim But it’s also known that in bcc metals, softening (which is an aspect of
this kink pair formation) is more pronounced than in fcc [23]. This is due
to the fact that in bcc metals the dislocations have screw character, and
if you form a kink it has edge character. Therefore due to the strain field
it’s prone to segregation—more prone than in fcc.

Adrian Sutton No dispute with that in bec.

Dave Rugg Just a very short response to your question of: Do we care? As you know,
I’m very interested in safety-critical structures, both aerospace and
nuclear, and the answer is yes. The reason for that is very simple: What


Ineed is predictive capability. If we don’t understand the mechanisms,
I’d put forward the view that all you can predict is what I already know,
