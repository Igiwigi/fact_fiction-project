Neither BotcyaT nor PEREMESCHKo make any mention of these dilata-
tions, and in the figure which the latter observer gives of the blood-vessels no sign of
them is visible,

Observations.—-In the thyroid gland of the Tortoise I have frequently observed, in
transverse sections of the epithelial walls of the vesicles (in uninjected specimens),
projections of the capillaries between the epithelial cells, towards the interior of the
vesicles, IT have endeavoured repeatedly to show these by injections of the blood-
vessels of the gland in this animal, but without much s8nccess, owing to a shrinking of
the epithelial cells. Tt appears very probable that it is through these projections of
the capillaries that the escape of blood-corpuscles (red or colourless) takes place into
the cavity of the vesicles. In fact, in one specimen I could ee in a vesiele, close to
one of the capillary projections, some red and colourless þlood-corpuscles which had
apparently just escaped from a blood-vessel through this channel. Some peculiarities
of the blood-vessels in the thyroid glands of Birds have been alluded to under the
head of lymphatics (vide $ypra, p. 598), and those of the Conger Eel have also been
referred to above (p. 599). The relation of both large and capillary blood-vessels to the lymphatics has been
discussed in considering the basement membrane (vide $4pra, P. 588).
