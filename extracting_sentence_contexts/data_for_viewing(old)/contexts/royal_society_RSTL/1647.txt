doing s0, rather by their united effect, than by their weight
of evidence when considered singly. Stars that have been
but seldom observed, give results considerably affected by
accidental error of observation ; which error is quite of a
different nature from that produced by permanent defect in
the instrument, and which repetition of observation has no
tendency to remove.

If the deviations of those stars that have been imperfectly
observed, were attributable either to error of observation, or
defect in the instruments, the deviation would either follow no
law at all, or some law depending upon zenith distance : but
the facts we have seen to be at variance with either of these
hypotheses. Not however to rest satisfied with these con-
siderations drawn from the general tendency of all the stars

without exception, let us select some striking examples of
deviation, in particular groups of stars, on which we might
be satisfied to rest the issue of this question. Of these groups
