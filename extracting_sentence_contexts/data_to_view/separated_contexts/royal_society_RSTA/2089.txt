The entropy rate (4.14) does not
depend on the Hamiltonian or its decomposition. Partial entropies can be defined for decomposed
systems which are discussed in §5. The entropy production (4.38); is not negative according to the Second Law (4.75)

D=-p-f=—p®.f>0. (4.77)

But pay attention to the fact that different expressions of the entropy production belong to
different controlled systems: (4.77); belongs according to (4.30) to a non-isolated system, whereas :
(4.77)2 represents the entropy production of an isolated system according to (4.31). The value of D8
the entropy production is equal in both systems because isolation of a system does not influence are
the entropy production according to (4.34). This difference of the meaning of (4.77); and (4.77) 1
comes into sight, if equilibria are discussed (§4f). 1

The propagator @¢om vanishes in conventional quantum mechanics and with it also the entropy : 3
rate and entropy exchange and production according to (4.71) and (4.74).
