analysis. Apart from the fact that some of the alternative theories criticized here have been
applied to locusts and butterflies alike, there are already indications that the principles
governing butterfly migration may not be as remote from those suggested for locusts as has
been supposed.

First, Wiltshire (1946) has pointed out that Lepidoptera migrations, when observed
within their ‘geographical headquarters’, follow a complicated pattern:

‘The general picture is one of travel in many directions under environmental stimuli
and of temporary or permanent settlement wherever the environment permits.’

The over-simplified picture of an emigration followed by a return as the set pattern of
butterfly migration arises, in Wiltshire’s view, from the fact that most observers of Palaearctic
butterflies reside, not in the headquarters region of these species, but at the extreme edge of
that zoogeographical zone.

Secondly, the records already assembled by Williams (1949 e¢ ante) show a clear prepon-
derance of migrant butterfly flight directions against or with the wind rather than across it.
“This he dismisses as mere coincidence, or as due to a ‘psychological error’ on the part of
observers. It must be admitted that such crude statistics are not reliable evidence of any
real preference on the part of the migrants. But neither are they evidence against the exis-
tence of such a preference. The data, aggregated without regard to the varying and often
unrecorded circumstances at the time of observation, do not permit any allowance to be
made for wind speed and height of flight. This procedure would conceal the sort of
consistency in flight direction-wind direction relations found with locusts. What can, there-
