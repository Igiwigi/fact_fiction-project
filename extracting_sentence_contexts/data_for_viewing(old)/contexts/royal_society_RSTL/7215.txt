iron wire remained soft, was not capable of becoming hard when heated red-hot an
suddenly cooled, and was not altered in aspect or in s0lubility in acids. The gas extri-

cated by the air-exhauster amounted to l

Of this gas 20-76 cub. centims. proved to be carbonic oxide. Pure iron, then, is capable
off taking up at a low red heat, and holding when cold, 415 volumes of carbonic oxide gas. j
This fact was confirmed in various other experiments. It explains partly, if not
entirely, the abundance of carbonic oxide observed among the natural gases of iron in
experiments 1, 2, and 3. In the course of its preparation wrought iron may be supposed
to occlude six or eight times its volume of carbonic oxide gas, which is carried about
ever after. How the qualities of iron are affected by the presence of such a substance,
no way metallic in its characters, locked up in so strange a way, but, capable of reappear-
ing, under the influence of heat, at any time, with the elastic tension of a gas, is a subject
which metallurgists may find worthy of investigation. i

'The relations of the metal iron to carbonic oxide gas appear to be altogether peculiar.
They cannot fail to have a bearing upon the important process of acieration. The inter-
vention of carbonic oxide in the usual process of the cementation of iron with charcoal,
long recognized by accurate observers, may be said now to be placed beyond all doubt
