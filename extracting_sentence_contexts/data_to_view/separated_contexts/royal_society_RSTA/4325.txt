However, if our random
graph construction is too similar to the biological networks to pick up important distinctive
features of biological organization, then it does not explain the observed unique patterns in TE nor
that AI is largest for control kernel nodes which play a prominent role in the regulation of function
for the biological network. We therefore accept that the lack of distinct emergent, global patterns
in information generated due to causal architecture as a real feature of biological organization and
not an artefact of our construction. This observation may offer clues to what may in fact be the
most distinct features of biological systems.


4. Characterizing informational architecture

The foregoing analyses indicate that what distinguishes biology as a physical system cannot be causal
structure (topology) alone, but instead biology can be distinguished by its informational architecture,
which arises as an emergent property of the combination of topology and dynamics. This is
supported by the distinct scaling in information processing (TE) observed for the fission yeast
cell-cycle network as compared to ER and SF ensembles reported above.
