The effect of scattering is to diminish the intensity of the incident radiation, giving
rise to the phenomenon of attenuation especially noticeable in the diminution of
intensity of solar radiation in its passage through the earth’s atmosphere. The
consideration of attenuation as due to scattering alone involves the assumption that
energy is nowhere accumulating in the gas. In order to give greater generality to
the application of the analysis we introduce a term expressing the fact that the
temperature at any point is increasing. If E be the intensity of radiation crossing unit area of a plane at a point « in unit
time, the loss to E in a distance dx in unit time due to the conversion of radiant
energy into molecular agitation represented by a rise of temperature is of the form

between vibrating systems within the molecules and the motions of the molecules
themselves which define the temperature of a gas on the kinetic theory scale as
proportional to the mean squares of molecular velocities.
