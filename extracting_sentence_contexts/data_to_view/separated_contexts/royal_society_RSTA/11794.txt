the first and not the second solution is in good accordance with his other measurements,

the observations (see p. 75). In fact, the contours of the compound-curve for both
solutions are very close together, and neither differs more from the observations than

most normal curves differ from symmetrical frequency-curves im statistical measure-

ments of this kind. : ;
The contours are so close that, notwithstanding we have demonstrated a theoretical

uniqueness for the solution of the problem (see p. 72, et seq.), we Bee that, from the
standpoint of practical statistics, it is possible for the given material to be broken up
into more than one pair of normal curves. Thus the problem indeed becomes some-
what arbitrary—at any rate till the asymmetry of the frequency-curve becomes much
more marked than is the case with that of the foreheads of Naples crabs. Indeed,
although the method adopted leads to only two solutions, it is quite possible that
pairs of component normal curves might be tentatively found lying in the neighbour-
hood of those determined by the above solutions, which would give resultant-curves
fairly close to the frequency-curve.
