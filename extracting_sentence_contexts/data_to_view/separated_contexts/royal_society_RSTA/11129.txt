In fact, when multiplied by zy/(ScA — sin d), the products
8 give the values of those constants. It is therefore clear from the figure that these
& circulations are in opposite directions alternately, and that we get two alternate
8 series of ascending and descending values,

= The function S (A) =Sid — sin d denotes the area between the J curve and the
3 axis of « up to the point ». It is clear, therefore, that it has its maximum values at

= The tracing of the current sheets is particularly easy from the fact that they are
& given by functions of the form

On squared paper, draw a series of circles, radii sub-multiples of a, say at intervals
of ‘05a or ‘1a, also the circle 7 =7. This last circle has the property that all the
current sheets cut it at right angles.
