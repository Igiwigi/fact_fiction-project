volume a mechanical forcive the same as the one thus deduced from the energy
function. An infinite number of such stress-systems might in fact be specified, for
there are six components of stress which need satisfy only three conditions. if
however the stress system is required to be symmetrical with respect to the lines of
polarization, there is in this respect no indefiniteness (§ 40); and the one given by
von Hetmuonrz is of this kind. Thus the definite result really deduced by
von Hetmuottz from his energy hypothesis is an expression for the bodily
mechanical forcive in the polarized medium, the (X, Y, Z) of equation (4) of his
memoir; while correlative formule are applied by him and by Krrcuuorr for the
bodily forcive in a magnetized medium. These expressions, however, definitely
contradict the formule of Maxwe 1 and of the other previous writers for the bodily
mechanical forcive in a magnetized medium, which are in general agreement with
those developed in this paper: in fact von Hetmuorrz translates his formule into
MAXweEtw’s electric stress system, while MAxwett himself had to invent for the
case of magnetic polarization, which was the one he considered, a different stress-
system, namely his magnetic stress.
