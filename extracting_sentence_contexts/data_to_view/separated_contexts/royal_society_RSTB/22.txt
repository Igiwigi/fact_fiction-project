From the account there given we have drawn up the following Table, showing the
relation between his nomenclature of centres stimulated and ours, and in the third
column the results he obtained. We find, however, that the area of cortex in which the upper limb is represented
extends a little further towards the fissure of Syivius than he has indicated ; it is
difficult also to make out the exact position of our centres 2 and 2’ in relation to his,
but perhaps we may include them in his centre 6. With these trifling differences, it will be seen that the broad facts in our account
are practically identical with his, all minuteness of detail contained in the following
pages being of course superadded by us. MINUTE ANALYSIS OF CORTICAL CENTRES. 157,
