Given
a wind speed higher than the insectâ€™s maximum air speed, however, such an up-wind turn
could not be a successful compensatory response, for it would demand an increase of air
speed which the insect cannot make. Yet what the insect actually does, turn down-wind, will
not be a completely successful response either, for the front-to-back image movement it
experiences while flying down-wind will be excessively fast. In fact, as was apparent in the
field, such locusts are in an unstable condition. It seems that, for a locust faced with this dilemma, direct front-to-back image movement
at an excessive rate is more tolerable than transverse image movement at a somewhat less
but still excessive rate, as well as more tolerable than even quite slow back-to-front move-
ments, so that the down-wind orientation is taken up. Two possibilities should be kept in mind with regard to this down-wind orientation.
