M. Dv Buar then gives the result of 44 experiments made by swinging pen-
dulums formed of spheres of lead, glass and wood, of different weights, and sus-
pended by lines of different lengths: and the conclusion at which he arrives

is, that the value of » (which, in his experiments, varies, with only 4 slight ex-
ceptions, from 1:67 to 1:45) may be assumed equal to 1'585 Þ. This certainly
agrees with the fact much more nearly than might be expected from the rough
manner in which those enquiries were conducted, as compared with more
modern experiments. And, although it cannot be placed in competition with
the more rigid investigations of M. BxssEL, or the results detailed in this
paper, yet it evinces the great talent and zeal of the author in being able to
extract 80 near an approximation from such a mode of procedure. M. Du
Buar then gives the result also of a vast variety of similar experiments on
cylinders, prisms, cubes, &c. : and found in each of them a complete confirma-
tion of his opinion relative to the dragging of the fluid in which the vibrations
