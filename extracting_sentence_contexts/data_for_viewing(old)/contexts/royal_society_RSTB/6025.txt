For instance, it is difficult to picture “ the dentine becoming porous through a process
which starts from the protoplasm contents of Tome’s canals ” and also accept the same
author’s statement that the odontoblasts have already shed their fibrils which are the

protoplasmic eaptent of Tome’s canals. We have never observed that the dentine
becomes “ porous,” and consider that most of the incompatibility apparent in the above
summary is due to its authors having used transverse sections from different physio-
logical levels of the teeth, and also to the fact that nothing was then known of the
reaction of a tooth to death of the primary dentine—in fact, such an occurrence had not
then been recognized.

The bone absorption and deposition in the jaw, referred to by these writers, are pre-
sumably the normal physiological phenomena of “ tooth wandering ” which are always
observed in young guinea-pigs, but the processes appear in our preparations to be held
up during scurvy owing to cellular degeneration, figs. 10 and 11. The “ amorphous
calcification of predentine ” is what we have described as calcific deposits sealing off
the dead primary dentine, figs. 5a and 6b. It remains, therefore, only to consider
whether the tissue found in the pulp during subscurvy, or when the animal is recovering
from an attack of acute scurvy, is, as we suggest, calcific scar tissue or whether it is a
new deposit of bone in the pulp, as previous writers have thought.
