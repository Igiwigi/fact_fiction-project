As if this fact
was not remarkable enough, the regeneration capabilities of
some planarian species include the complete and correct recon-
stitution of their nervous tissue, including their brain [21-24]. It is difficult to overstate the potential relevance of these organ-
ismsâ€™ regenerative abilities for the possible development of
medical treatments for neurological diseases and injures. Inter-
estingly, there is also mounting evidence that decapitated
planarians that regenerate their heads partially retain some
learned habits or training acquired prior to the decapitation
event, a fact that is particularly relevant to the exploration of
where memories are stored in an organism [25-27]. In the process of developing their ideas about the brain,
Sarnat and Netsky proposed as a working hypothesis that the
planarian brain could be seen as a precursor of the human
brain. In other words, they essentially proposed that the planar-
ian brain was the first evolutionary example of a vertebrate-
style brain.
