The latter, however, are said, in
many of the genera, to be “very scanty.” On the other hand, zoologists have
frequently described certain recent simple corals as Turbinolids in which a few

“ ”

dissepiments are present. As a matter of fact, the distinction is not one which can be sharply made in’
nature, since all transitions are found between Trochosmiliacese with a rich develop-
ment of dissepiments, and Trochosmiliaceze with solid deposit in the base of the
calyx, and but few dissepiments in higher horizons. I shall have occasion, later,
to point out other features in which the Trochosmiliaceze show more affinity with the
Turbinolide than with the Astreide. So far it is clear that, with regard to thew
basal deposit, the simple corals belonging to the Trochosmiliaceze afford types
transitional between the families Astrid, E.H., and Turbinolide, E.H.
