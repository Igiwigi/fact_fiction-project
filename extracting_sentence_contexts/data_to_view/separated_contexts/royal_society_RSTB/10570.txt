social or epigenetic feedbacks may play important roles in
determining male mating propensities.

6. Implications beyond equids: an argument for
long-term socioecological studies

The work discussed here suggests a different sort of relation-
ship between a species’ ecology and its behaviour or social
structure than one in which the former ‘pushes’ the latter
(as in the early precursors to socioecological models) or
even a bidirectional relationship wherein environments
shape behaviours of species that, in turn, reshape those
environments. The equids’ multiplicity of responses to
environmental stressors suggests that physiology acts like a
prism, splitting environmental influences into variants-on-
theme depending on how physiology and other constraints
interact (figure 3).
