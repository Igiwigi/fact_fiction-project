Starting from a simplified version of the scaling of the energy confinement time, and taking into
account the density limit, it is possible to derive an expression for the fusion triple product in
terms of the main device parameters [3,4]. In the published derivation the plasma was assumed
to be cylindrical and so the elongated shape of the plasma was not included. Repeating the
derivation but including the shape characterized through the aspect ratio, A=Ro/a and the
elongation, «, we find
2 7/2

nT tp x ab () . (2.2)

The details of the derivation are given in appendix A. Here H = (TE) experiment / (TE) scaling is a
simple numerical factor included to allow for the fact that in experiments the actual confinement
time, (TE)experiment, can be above or below (TE) scaling: Typically H is in the range 0.8-2.0. The
parameter q = RoBrk. /A*lp is an operational parameter related to the pitch of the magnetic field
in the plasma and known as the ‘safety factor’. Experiments have shown that q must be kept >2.5
and so for a given device it is essentially a constraint on the maximum current that can be used.

Equation (2.2) shows clearly how the fusion triple product depends on size (major radius),
field and shape, and how the magnitude of one of these parameters can be traded for another.
We note especially that the dependence on shape, (k”/*/A%), is strong. For example, going from
the conventional tokamak (A =3.4, x = 1.8) to the spherical tokamak (A = 1.8, « =2.7), the major
radius can be reduced by factor of approximately 5, or the field can be reduced by factor of
approximately 3, for the same nTTg.
