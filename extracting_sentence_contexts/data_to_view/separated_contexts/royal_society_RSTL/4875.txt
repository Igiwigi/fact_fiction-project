was obtained supplied to them. The ova were
placed in a temperature of about 60?, and nearly the whole produced embryos. These facts proved that the ova employed were till fitted to become impregnated
when the fluid was supplied to them in $ufficient abundance, and for a sufficient length
of time, and within the period during which the envelope continues to expand and im-
bibe most rapidly. This condition is always promoted by an early removal from a
low to a comparatively high temperature during the period of expansion, as in Set G,
in which segmentation took place in from, five hours and @ half to 8ix hours, and when

the removal from low to high temperature was within the first half hour ; while it did
not occur, in the only experiment in which it happened in Set F, No. 1, until the end
of siv hours and a-half, when the remoyal from a similar low to a like high tempera-
ture was not made until one hour and a half after impregnation.
