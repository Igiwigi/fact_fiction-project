primitive ; the protostelic and solenostelic arrangements are now generally believed
to be earlier types than the dialystelic, but the forrner are found most obviously
in the creeping axes, and the latter in the upright. A good example of this, within a
natural group, is seen in Mohria, as compared with Lygodium. But it is to be
borne in mind that the upright forms have for the most part their leaves crowded
upon a dialystelic stock, though they all start from a protostelic structure in the
embryo; the necessary dilation of the stock to accommodate the crowded leaves
would demand a distributed vascular supply, while mechanical requirements may also
have played their part, for the strains upon the axis from a tufted series of leaves will
be better met by a distended, than by a strictly central, vascular arrangement.
Such a change from the protostelic to the dialystelic type might well be found
as a direct adaptation in plants which retained otherwise relatively primitive
conditions of leaf and sorus. â€˜Taking all these facts and physiological considerations
together, it seems reasonable to hold that the Fern-shoot was primitively radial, and
that the dorsiventral has been a derivative condition, which originated at many
points, while its advantages led to its perpetuation in a large number of living Ferns.

The slight differentiation of the sporophylls from the foliage leaves is a marked
feature in Ferns, and the same question arises here as in other Pteridophyta, as to
their relations. Such differences as do occur are readily recognised as due to
correlative growth, but, in addition to this, middle forms are common between the
two ;} and these, together with developmental evidence, support the just conclusion
that sterile leaves and sporophylls are truly comparable parts. There are those who
maintain that sporophylls are, from the point of view of descent, foliage leaves
altered by the addition of sporangia ; in fact, that the foliage leaf was the prior type,
