users; the common assumption of an ‘intelligent’ or ‘inquisitive’ clinician familiar
with the nuisances of this measure may need to be re-evaluated.

The situation in muscle is even more complex, given the difficulty of separating
haemoglobin and myoglobin optical signals [4]. One measure (haemoglobin)
integrates information from blood flow and oxygen consumption; the other
(myoglobin) is a pure measure of intracellular partial pressure of oxygen (pOz).
The optimistic view of this dilemma is that—were the optical complexities
to be satisfactorily resolved—a much deeper understanding of tissue oxygen
metabolism is possible in organs that contain myoglobin. The difficulty of
interpreting cytochrome c oxidase changes solely as a surrogate marker of cellular
oxygen content is not present with myoglobin, whose oxygenation state is in rapid
equilibrium with the pO». In fact, given the robustness to cellular conditions of
the myoglobin p50, an absolute myoglobin oxygenation state is a direct readout
of intracellular pOg.

The use of a single measure of absolute SO, as a standard of care marker or
robust predictor of outcome in a clinical environment is still not conclusive despite
multiple studies in carotid endarterectomy, cardiac surgery and septic shock
[16,17]. Concerns remain about the validity of the absolute number, particularly
when taking into account the variety of different instruments which may be
used for its measurement (see table 1). These issues are further complicated
when the algorithms describing the derivation of this measure are not in the
public domain. Concerns were also raised about test/retest variability and the
