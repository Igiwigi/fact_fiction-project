In this paper, we will be interested in the Heisenberg—Weyl algebra A generated by P and Q (the
‘coordinates’ of one-dimensional quantum mechanics!), with the canonical commutation relation

QP — PQ=ih.

The meaning of ‘generated’ depends on the choice of topology on the algebra, and is one of the
sources of trouble with this algebra.

'Much of the discussion here also applies to the general case of the nth Heisenberg—Wey] algebra A) ‘generated by self-
adjoint operators’ P,..., Pn, Qu,---, Qu, but we do not need to work in such generality for the purposes of this paper.


The representation theory of A is notoriously complicated, in particular, owing to the fact that
the algebra cannot be represented as an algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space.

As suggested by Hermann Wey] and following the Stone-von Neumann theorem, we may
consider the representation theory of algebras generated by the Wey! operators, which can be
formally defined as

U* =exp(iaQ) and Vea exp(ibP),

for a,b € R. These are unitary (and so bounded) operators if P and Q are self-adjoint, and the
following commutation relation holds:

utv! = qv? ut,
