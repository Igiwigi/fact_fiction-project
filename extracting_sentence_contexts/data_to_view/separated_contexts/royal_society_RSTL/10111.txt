The greater the
conductivity the greater will be the intensity of the currents ab the surface of the
8phere, but the more rapid will be the rate of diminution as we pass inwards; and it
is easily 8een from (71) that one cause will exactly compensate the other.

* The above reults enable us to estimate what ought to be tho thickness of a sheet of a given metal
in order that it should act as a screen against a periodic electromagnetic action of given frequency. See
the paper by Lord RarLeacn, cited below. MOTIONS IN A SPHERICAL CONDUCTOR. 537

In fact, if we write
R n R l, R
w=l udr, v al var, w =þ war,

where the lower limit is taken at such a depth that the currents there are insensible,
we readily find that the currents are approximately equivalent to an infinitely thin
spherical current 8heet of radius R, the components of the current at any point of the
sheet being given by

two concentric spherical surfaces.
