It is noteworthy that the droplet and capillary clusters reported in [11-28] are two-dimensional
(2D) ones. The subclass of 2D clusters are the chain-like clusters in which particles or droplets
form polymer-like structures due to a structural phase transition [15,37,38,41-43]. The distinction
between 3D (bulk), 2D (plane) and 1D (linear or chain) clusters is important, due to the fact that
the fundamental thermodynamic properties of 3D, 2D and 1D systems differ very strongly [44,45]. Thus, for example, phase transitions are impossible in 1D systems under certain assumptions [44]. Moreover, the Ising model suggests that ‘true’ phase transitions are impossible in finite systems,
in particular they are impossible in clusters, whatever their dimensions are.
