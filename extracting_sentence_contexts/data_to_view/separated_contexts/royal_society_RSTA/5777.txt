Once installed in the infected individual, corona viruses attack the lungs, but in some cases
other organs, and are able to evade some mechanisms of the immune defense. Therefore, the
modelling approach should also consider the role of the immune system in the complex dynamics
under consideration from the innate to the activated immunity [10,11]. The role of immune
competition is decisive and attention to this competition is also motivated by the fact that
infectivity and onset of variants depend on the viral charge as well as on the number of infected
individuals. In addition, it is necessary to account for the dynamics of the in-host immune
competition that develops when the presence of viral particles releases danger signals which
activates the reaction of the hostâ€™s innate immunity. The need for science to respond to the worldwide situation has generated a broad variety of
research contributions.
