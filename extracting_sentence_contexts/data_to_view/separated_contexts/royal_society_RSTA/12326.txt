Tn these formule all the quantities are functions of ) ; now although ) can easily
be found from the ‘ Nautical Almanace,’ it is not tabulated, and the difficulty of using
the tide-table would be considerably augmented if it were necessary to compute ) for
each tide. We shall proceed, then, to convert our formule into others, in which
there is direct reference to moon’s true transit, although there is some loss of accuracy
in the process, and the amount of computation required to form the table is increased. We have seen that the time T’ of fictitious transit is given by

T’=T+8T+ 5Mcosg + SNsing,

and that (y —y)T +h—-—l=q7 where /, and / correspond to the time of fictitious
transit.
