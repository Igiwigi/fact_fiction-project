This we observed to follow the weak excitation, we always employed, at centres—

fe Tt will thus be seen that the focus of the area of representation of the lower limb is

& the commonest seat of epileptiform disturbance. This may be due to the fact that the
different regions of the lower limb area do not equally respond to the same stimulus,
so that the same current just sufficient to evoke movement from one centre may cause
overaction of another. Though it is undoubtedly a fact that some centres are more
easily excited than others, still we do not put this prominently forward in any other
sense than as a suggestion towards the interpretation of the above-described locali-
sation of the tendency to the development of epileptiform convulsions.
