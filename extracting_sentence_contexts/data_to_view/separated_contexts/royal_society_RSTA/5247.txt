This was only slightly below the expected
value, the difference being attributable to losses at the ends, which were not optimally designed,
and residual viscous damping in the vacuum that we could achieve. We also note that the
time-dependent relaxation after deflection of a torsion balance, the anelastic after-effect, is also
proportional to A [7,12]. The origin of the second, gravitational term is the fact that as the torsion strip turns the
lower end rises. The potential energy thus gained supplies the restoring torque. For an angular
deflection 6, the potential energy of the suspended mass, Mp, increases by an amount given by

This can be due only to the mass being raised to a height Ah above its rest position

For small angular deflections, Ah can be very small.
