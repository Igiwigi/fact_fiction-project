Subject Areas: of MS is due to the fact that it enables direct
analytical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical identification of molecules based on the mass-to-
biology, spectroscopy charge ratios as well as fragmentation patterns. Thus,

for several decades now, MS has been used in
qualitative chemical analysis. To address the pressing
need for quantitative molecular measurements, a
number of laboratories focused on technological and
