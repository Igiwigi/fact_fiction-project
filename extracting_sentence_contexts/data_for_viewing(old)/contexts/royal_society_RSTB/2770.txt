conclusions can be based upon these experiments.

3. Concentration or Dilution of the Water.—In the series 10-12, 23-27, 33-36,
52-54, 59-61, the experiment was made of diluting the water in which the eggs
were lying for a few hours before fertilisation. ‘The eggs were placed in sea water
mixed with various proportions of distilled or tap water, and before being mixed
with sperm were put back into normal sea water. It was found that the water
could be diluted up to a very considerable extent without injuring the eggs, but no
very constant effects were observed in the larve. On the whole, they were perhaps
rather less well developed, and had the maternal characters slightly reduced. The
most marked effect of the dilution was to render the fertilisation of the eggs by
sperm of another species very much more easy (cf. percentages fertilised in Nos. 23—
27); this fact will be referred to again below.

Dilution of the sperm with fresh water could not be carried on to the same extent
without destroying its vitality, but larvae obtained from sperm which had been in
water containing 33 per cent. of tap water for half-an-hour (Nos. 173-175) did not
differ greatly from those fertilised by fresh sperm.

A few observations were made on the results of concentrated sea water acting upon
the eggs (Nos, 89-90, 135-138, 157-159), but in these again the larvee were but little
affected. :

4. Maturity.—Apart from the question of the seasonal change observed in the
