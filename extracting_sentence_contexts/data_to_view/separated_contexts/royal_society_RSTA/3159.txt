The difference between the means of the 26 and the 71 deter-
minations is 1 in 1,000,000. These results are of considerable importance, as they show very great constancy
both of current weigher and cell. In fact, the cell and balance proved to be much
more constant and reliable than the standard resistance, although the latter was very
earefully made and annealed with a view to ensuring permanency,

The precision of measurement attainable with the new balance exceeds the most
sanguine expectations of its designers. It was intended to give the ampere to 1 in
10,000, and an accuracy of 1 in 20,000 was hoped for, but 1 in 50,000 has been
attained. The instrument itself admits of a far higher accuracy, for a tenth of a
milligramme can be detected with certainty, and this, in a total of 15 grammes, the
balancing mass for 1 ampere, means 1 in 300,000 in the value of the current.
