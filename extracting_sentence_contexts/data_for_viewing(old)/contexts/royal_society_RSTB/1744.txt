The structure of the xylem is essentially similar to that of the petiolar bundle of
Lyginodendron. The majority of the tracheides are spiral or reticulate, but some _
are pitted. ‘The lax spiral elements (protoxylem) lie in the interior of the strand.

The structure of the cortex of the petioles has been sufficiently described above.

One point remains to be discussed ; in two, at least, of the preparations, sporangia,
like those of certain Ferns,* are found in association with Heterangium foliage.t A
portion of one of these preparations is represented in fig. 23, The sporangium, sm.,
is in close contact with a fragment of leaf, which appears to be continuous witha
small petiole of Heterangium. If the continuity between the sporangium and the
leaf could be established, the fact would be of the greatest importance. Careful —
examination of the preparation, however, leads us to doubt much whether this was
the case. The fragment is in bad condition, and we found it impossible to prove that
the shred of tissue on which the sporangium is seated, really. belonged to the
Heterangium foliage. ;

The other preparation in question (C.N. 1292) contains numerous sporangia, none
of which, however, are connected with the foliage. This slide contains petioles of
Rachiopteris Oldhamia, Wit., as well as of the Heterangium, so that here it is plain —
that no definite conclusion can be drawn. In other cases seeds have been found in
association with specimens of Heterangium,{ but there is not the slightest reason for
supposing that they have anything to do with our plant. Here, again, the question
of fructification must for the present remain undecided.
