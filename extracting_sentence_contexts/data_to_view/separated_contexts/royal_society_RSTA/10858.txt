The equations to be solved are thus reduced
to others which are linear and homogeneous in the Jacobians, and which do not
contain the dependent variables. The equations (4) give two of the Jacobians of u,v linearly in terms of the
others ; if we substitute for these two in the identity

Xu, v)
du, v) = z Bats 5) Ua xj),

we find that d(u, v) is a linear combination of the determinants of the matrix of tent
columns.

* This solution will not be a complete primitive unless a certain number of other arbitrary constants are
involved as well as a, ), a supposition which is neither made nor excluded. It may be well to point out that the solution here assumed consists of two equations, and not of one
equation involving an arbitrary function; in fact, any solution whatever necessarily consists of two
equations, and one point of the present method is that these are to be sought together, not successively.

+ For » independent variables the number of columns in the matrix will be 4(n + 1)(n + 2), the
number of rows being still three,

There are thus eight biditferential expressions, and the problem is to be solved by
finding such multiples of these as, when added together, will form a complete
bidifferential.

§ 12. As in the case of Lacraner’s linear equation, this will generally, in practice,
be done by inspection, and the method will be useful for finding solutions in finite
terms—when such exist.
