Action may be grouped under the following heads.

(1) The rapid rate of diffusion of dissolved solids required through the medullary
ray cells, and the powers of selective absorption and re-excretion needed by them.

(2) The fact that this action is no longer possible in vessels completely filled with
water, and that hardly any plants immediately exhibit bleeding if the stem is cut
when transpiration is active.

(3) The fact that when water is driven through under pressure, the flow is most
rapid through those vessels which are completely filled with water.

(4) The fact that the flow of water through short lengths of stem under pressure
or suction is always less than would be expected from a viscosity calculation, and not
greater, as might be expected if any pumping action were at work.

(5) The fact that, ceteris paribus, the flow is as rapid up a stem as down it.

(6) The fact that Srraspurcer* has found that long lengths of stem (often
12 metres) remain capable of conducting sufticient water to keep the upper parts
fresh for several days after the stem has been killed by heat or poison, and that the
conductivity may be temporarily restored by injection with water.

With regard to this last objection, the mere fact that the trunk and branches of a
tree when saturated, may contain sufficient available water for a few days to two or
