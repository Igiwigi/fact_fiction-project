112 MR. J. JOLY ON THE SPECIFIC HEATS

arrangement providing for a supply of gas not limited to the capacity of the gas-
holder, enabled a much greater quantity to be used as a wash-out in the first instance.

The difficulty of obtaining concordant observations on different samples of hydrogen
having become very apparent, T resolved to continue the system of making two
observations upon the one sample of gas. It appeared to me, indeed, that a point of
far higher interest than the actual value to be ascribed to the specific heat of the gas
was the question as to the nature of its variation with change of pressure.

In the very next series, VII., however, my intention of duplicating the experiments
was frustrated. In releasing the gas, in fact, at the conclusion of the series, I detected
an odour of nitrous fumes, which induced me to seek the source of the impurity and
start a fresh series. The source of the impurity turned out to be the tube containing
the nitrate of silver, which was probably becoming affected by acid carried by the gas.
The tube was suppressed, and a tube containing copper potassium tartrate, carried on
pumice, substituted. The use of this tube entirely removed the odour of H,S which
the gas quitting the generating bottle had to some extent, and, in fact, the gas passed
on quite free from smell.

It is improbable that VII. is affected appreciably by the amount of oxide of nitrogen
present, A very small quantity would have sufticed to impart the odour.
