The anterior end
of the groove of the vomer probably received the ethmoid directly. This arrange-
ment is suz generis and at the same time a foreshadowing of the mammalian
condition.

(2) A well-marked floccular recess exists.

(3) The existence of a transpalatine bone, which has so often been denied, is
established beyond doubt (Plate 17, fig. 1, Trans.).

(4) The cavity which Broom has called the maxillary antrum proves to be an inter-
and not a intra-osseal space, several bones contributing to the formation of its wall-
(Plate 17, fig. 2).

(5) Septo-maxillary bones are present (Plate 17, fig. 1, sma). Besides these chief new facts, the method has enabled us to study more exactly the
forms of the bones and cavities and their relation to each other, and to make all our
statements with the confidence of certainty. Seeing that the skull has been studied
since 1845, and that Broom has spoken of it as one of the most completely known
fossil skulls, we think that the results of our investigation justify the expenditure
of time necessitated by the method employed, an expenditure which, after all, is a
saving in the end. We now proceed to a description of the specimen we have investigated, but before
doing so we insert here, for the assistance of the reader, a diagram of the roof
(text-fig. 2) and the palatal surface (text-fig. 3) of the Dicynodon skull, in which we
have embodied our own results with those of other observers.
