These changes are described under the heading, “The Formation of the Corpus
luteum” (p. 78). f

My observations regarding the stimulus necessary to induce ovulation may be
conveniently described in the form of a series of experiments. As already mentioned,
the periods of cestrus were detected by the attitude of the ewes towards the ram,
which, when required for the purpose of the experiment, was rendered temporarily
incapable of insemination,

Experiment 1.—A virgin ewe (a cross between a Cheviot ram and a Border
Leicester ewe) was killed a day after that its first oestrus had been observed,
coition not having been permitted. It was found that ovulation had recently taken
place. The subsequent examination of the ovaries pointed to the fact that there had
been no previous ovulation. The histology of the discharged follicle is described in
the following section of this paper as a twenty-four hour stage in the development of
the corpus luteum.

Experiment 2.—A Scotch Black-faced sheep early in the breeding season was
noted to be in a state of estrus, but coition was not permitted. Two days later
the ewe was killed, when it became evident that a follicle had recently ruptured.

There was no evidence that ovulation had occurred previously during that sexual
