earlier stage ; the probability, however, is in favour of the tissue in question being
merely part of the prothallus.

We have now to consider the question of the morphological nature of the seed-like
organ of Lepidocarpon—is it to be regarded as a true seed ?+ The idea of its being
a seed is suggested, in the first instance, by the presence of an integument, inclosing

+ We must not allow our minds to be influenced by the fact that the body was accepted without doubt
as a true seed before its relation to Lepidostrobus was known, The question must now be considered de novo,

the sporangium or nucellus, so as to leave only a narrow opening or micropyle, at the
top. The fact that only a single megaspore or embryo-sac, occupying almost the
whole of the sporangial cavity, comes to perfection, much heightens the resemblance
to a true seed, especially when we find the embryo-sac filled with the prothallus or
endosperm. The presence of an integument is in itself far from conclusive; the
indusium of the megasporangium in Azolla is at least equally like an integument, yet
it does not constitute the organ a seed, for it does not permanently inclose the
