The plates of the condenser are
E then virtually parts of the circuit. } The effect of a junction of two wires, say of the same diameter, but of different
= gpecific resistances, upon the level surface will resemble that of a charge upon the
Soeparating surface. This can be seen in a general way from the fact that the level
S 8urfaces must cut the wire with the higher speecific resistance at intervals shorter than
. & those at which it cuts the other wire. 2 Tf there be an insulated conducting body, say a metal sphere, near the circuit, we
'S know that in the steady state there is no electric intensity, and therefore no current
within it ; consequently there is no movement of energy and no movement of
> induction through it.
