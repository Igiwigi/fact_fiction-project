Figure 3. Analysis of a hypothetical dataset for ‘Dimorphinil’, a fictional drug. Normally distributed data were artificially generated for 40 ‘individuals’ of
each sex. (a) The values both above and below the population mean
(grey dotted line) consist of 18 members of one sex and 22 of the other. In other words, the numbers of above- and below-average individuals are
about the same for each sex. (b) A Student's t-test shows a significant sex
difference (p < 0.01). (c) The effect is medium-sized (d = 0.60) but
there is a high degree of overlap (A = 76%).
