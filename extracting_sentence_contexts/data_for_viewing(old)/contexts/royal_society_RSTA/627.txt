behaviour, as described in many comprehensive reviews on the state of the art for SMA 2 |
constitutive modelling (e.g. [2-5]). Because the complex response of SMAs has several facets
(pseudoelasticity, martensite reorientation, one- and two-way shape memory effects and 3
constrained recovery), only a few of the existing models seek to account for all of them at the same : 8
time [6-8]. In addition, there are some aspects that have yet to receive a sufficiently comprehensive ig
modelling treatment. One of these is the fact that, in certain situations, the phase transformations 18
are observed to occur in spatially localized domains [9]. Another of these is the relatively recent :f
discovery that, in some groups of alloys, phase transformations can be induced in specialized :
ways by magnetic fields [10].

In this paper, we describe a generalized modelling framework that is capable of consistently
dealing with both the above aspects, as well as the conventional ones involving thermal and load
activation. This is based on the idea, first introduced in [11], to model bodies made of SMAs as
structured continua characterized by a fully fledged set of balance equations for a suitably chosen : =
set of microstructural descriptors. Specifically, as in [11], these descriptors are taken in the form of 3
a scalar field and a second-order tensor field. Even though the basic idea of seeking an enriched
set of kinematic descriptors in continuum mechanics is not new, with antecedents tracing back nee)
to the Cosserat brothers, and unified general treatments presented in [12,13] among many others, :
