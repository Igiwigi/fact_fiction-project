me to be worthy of remark. With the aid of a wheel armed with insulating metallic
teeth, similar to that of Mons. Masson, I passed a current in a frog prepared in the
manner described above, that is to say, like that placed astride between two glasses.
In this manner I pass the current 500 or 600 times in the frog. After this, on
attempting to interrupt, and then again establish the circuit, the following phenome-
non strikes the experimenter. The inverse limb contracts on closing the circle, and
the direct limb on opening the circle. On leaving the circle closed for some minutes,
the ordinary phenomena—the opposite of the preceding—appear ; that is to say, the
direct limb contracts on closing, and the inverse limb on breaking the circle. It is
very difficult to reproduce these phenomena in the same frogs, on account of the
extreme feebleness produced by the numerous contractions.

The above fact establishes a fresh connection between neryous influence and the
passage of the electric current according to the direction of the latter, I will return
to this subject in the general views which I announced above.
