levels above their insertions on the apex, and unless their bundles all follow a course
parallel to the stem axis, measurements of their relative distances from the centre may not
reflect sufficiently exactly the transverse growth of the apex in successive plastochrones.
Serial sections circumvent this difficulty, for then each leaf may be measured at a com-
parable level close to its insertion. The chief objection to this procedure is that the centre
of the axis needs determining afresh on each section used, and the several estimates will not
exactly correspond. Nevertheless, there seems no doubt that it is generally preferable to
employ serial sections.

It is possible to avoid the determination of the axial centre altogether, for in a system
growing uniformly the plastochrone ratio (r) will appear in ratios of other distances on the
sections, e.g. numbering the primordia inversely as their ages, r will be given by the distance
of the centre of 3 from that of 2 divided by the distance of 2 from 1. This fact does not
generally provide the basis of a good method, for measurements so obtained are affected by
inequalities in divergence angle as well as in plastochrone ratio, but on occasion it may be

useful; a similar method is always useful in bijugate systems (including the opposite decus-
sate), where the distance across the apex between the members of any leaf pair is very
easily determined. Again, it is possible that in some plants the ratio of the diameters of
consecutive primordia may give a good estimate ofr, but usually the primordia do not grow
uniformly with the apex, and also change their form in the transverse plane during their
first few plastochrones.
