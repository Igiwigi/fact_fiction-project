are occupied in its immediate vicinity, so that it is not likely to be a modified pinna.

If the specimen is examined closely it will be seen that this fertile rachis slants down into
the matrix to the left, in a direction that would carry it beneath the rachis of that arm
of the frond which lies nearest to it, and also in the direction of the angle of the fork
of the main rachis. Another important fact to notice is that there is an object in the
angle of the fork, which appears in the photograph as a small black spot (Plate 17, fig. 24, d).
This structure actually consists of two small cavities, at the bottom of which one can see
carbonaceous matter. These cavities represent the cast of some organic body which
was in connection with the frond in the angle between the two arms of the frond. This
structure is not described by Krpston.

Taking all these facts into consideration, it seems highly probable that the fertile
rachis, seen on the right of the specimen (Plate 17, fig. 24, Â¢), was either itself attached to
the top of the main rachis in the angle of the fork, in the position suggested by the presence
of the small structure, or was a branch of some rachis attached in that position.

The attachments of the other groups of cupules are not shown, but the orientation of
the several cupules is in most instances such that the cupule segments point towards
the centre of a sphere on the surface of which the cupules lie. This centre of arrangement
coincides very nearly with the small structure in the angle of the fork. There is, therefore,
on the one hand, a clear suggestion of some relation between the ring of cupules and the
forking of the rachis of the frond, and, on the other hand, it appears less likely that the
cupules were related to the pinne attached to the sides of the main rachis or to the arms
of the frond,
