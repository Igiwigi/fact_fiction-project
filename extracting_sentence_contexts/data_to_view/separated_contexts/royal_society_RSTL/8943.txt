Again, if the lithocysts be left in si7u and the animal be
kept in a confined body of water, irritability will continue for days after all the usual
indications of spontaneity have disappeared. Nevertheless, with slight modifications, I
have confirmed Dr. Eier's experiment of placing different specimens of Aurelia aurita
under similar conditions, removing the lithocysts of some and not of others, and
observing that those individuals which had been operated upon died sooner than those
which had not,”

This year I have given careful attention to these secondary contractions mani-
fested by the mutilated swimming-organs of Aurelia aurita; and as the fact of their
occurrence will afterwards be found of importance in relation to some peculiar points
in the physiology of this animal, I shall here detail all the obseryations regarding the
subject which I have been able to make. In the first place, the aboye-quoted state-
ments with reference to Aurelia aurita have been this year, with one exception, fully
confirmed by numerous experiments. The one exception refers to my statement as to
having * frequently seen these after-contractions as rhythmical (though this is rare), as
effectual, and as powerful as those which had been previously supplied by the single
remaining lithocyst.” The word * rare ” here, as applied to the rhythmical nature of
these after-contractions, is not sufficiently strong.
