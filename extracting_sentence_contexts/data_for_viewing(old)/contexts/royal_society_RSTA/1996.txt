flux at outlet one; in this way it is possible to ensure that a constant polymer flow will enter
the system for the whole simulation time. All the other boundaries and the internal interfaces
between solid and fluid domain have been treated as a half-way bounce back, so as to ensure the
no-slip wall boundary condition. With respect to the considered operating conditions, it is useful
to report in table 4 the inlet polymer velocities for the presented simulations. Then, in order to
make a fair comparison of results obtained for all the tested configurations, the first parameter
to be analysed is the filling domain percentage, which is trivially equal to 1 when the gasket is
completely filled by the polymer. Obviously, by keeping constant the injection velocity for the
whole process, the mass is expected to linearly increase with time, but the aim of this comparison
is to underline the macroscopic differences which arise during the phenomenon evolution due to
substantial discrepancies in the polymerâ€™s viscosity. By referring to table 4, one can immediately
notice how the inlet velocity for ABS is practically half of that obtained for the PS at the same
Reynolds number. This is due to the fact that the plateau viscosity for PS is about double that for
ABS, as in table 3.

As reported in figure 8, the higher the Re, the shorter the injection time. As is easily predicted,
PS and ABS show different slopes as a function of the different plateau viscosity. Injection times
