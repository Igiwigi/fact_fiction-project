The second main finding is that the same trace element enrichment and
fractionation that is found on a grain scale also occurs on the scale of the entire lower crust [54]. This suggests that the lower crustal crystal mush acts as one system, and that it is permeable
throughout. This is consistent with the fact that the lower crust, at least at Hess Deep in the
Pacific, forms an overall upward differentiation sequence. Hence, the lower crustal crystal mush
is an interconnected system, evolving upwards, with a significant role for reactive porous flow. The consequences of reactive porous flow are profound: melt evolution no longer obeys the
laws of fractional crystallization.
