The impression produced on my own mind is the probability of a reversal
having taken place in the direction of the secular change at some time in the interval.
between 1818 and 1860, whereby the direction of the change which had been *increasing
Easterly ” or © decreasing Westerly ” in the space between Melville Island and Baftin's
Bay became * decreasing Fasterly ” or © increasing Westerly ” in the 8ame localities. The epoch of a change of this description may indeed be swpposed to have synchronized
approximately with the reversal in the direction of the secular change of the Declination
and of the Inclination which is now generally believed to have taken place in or about
the same meridians in Canada* and the United States; and it may be right to connect
both with the easterly progression of the phenomena in North-eastern Asia, attesting
the approach of the present Asiatic point of maximum Force to the American continent. These, however, are matters which may be safely left to the elucidation they may receive
from future researches in the same or in approximate localities; towards which the best
Service which can be at present rendered is the assemblage in groups, approximate in
time and locality, of the facts which we now possess. Such an assemblage will be found
at the close of Zone 8. Amongst the Magnetic Determinations made at $a, the fine 8eries of Professor
