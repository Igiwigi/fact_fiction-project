The easternmost sample contains the minimum, with 34'238 per 1000, and the
two westernmost- samples contain the greatest quantity of salt, with 36-084. Thus the
equatorial current appears as a continuation of the large West African rivers of the
equatorial zone, which dilute the sea-water of the equatorial region with about 8 per
cent. of fresh water, and thus counteract the great evaporation. While the equatorial
current, continues its course along the north-east coast of South America, it receives and
carries with it the waters of the Paranahyba, the Araguai, the Amazon river, the Ese-
quibo, the Orinoco, and numerous smaller rivers of the north coast of South America ;
but though I have no observations from this part of the current *, the fact is 8hown by
three observations from the sea in the neighbourhood of the Danish islands of St. Croix

* [When my remarks on the equatorial current between Cape Roque and the West Indian islands were
written, T was not aware of the very interesting observations which General Sapixe made in 1822, on the
influence of the water of the Amazon river on that of the Equatorial current. IT shall now insert them here,
their bearing being in the same way as my deficient obseryations.
