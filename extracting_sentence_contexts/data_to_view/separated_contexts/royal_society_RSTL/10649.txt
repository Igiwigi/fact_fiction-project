& Examining now the on curve, we see that the effect of moderately loading a
8tretched wire is to increase its magnetism, under the conditions we have here, but
that a maximum is passed, and the later stages of the loading diminish the mag-
netism. A similar maximum occurs on the off curve, but owing to the presence of
hysteresis it occurs at a s8maller value of the load than the maximum point in the 07
curve. Each maximum is, in fact, shifted by hysteresis to a later part of the
operation than it would otherwise occupy, and if there were no hysteresis we should
expect it to take a position between the two actual maximums, or ab aboub 8 kilos.
of total load. Another characteristic of the curves, obviously attributable to
hysteresis, is the comparatively easy gradient at the begiuning of the on curve and

Again ab the beginning of the off curve. 4F2
