In estimating the relationship of the Oryptogamic Flora of Rodriguez, we find
more difficulties to encounter from the fact that excepting the Vaseular Crypto-
gams, little comparatively has been done amongst the Oryptogams of the other
Mascarene Islands. The lower forms from Rodriguez have, however, been carefully
worked out, and I find that there are now known from the island, 173 species
of Oryptogams (this number excluding marine Age). Thus the Phenogams and
the Oryptogams are almost equal in number,

Of this number, 26 species or about one-seventh are Fitices, Ophioglossacee, and
Lycopodiacee. Mus constitute about two-eleyenths, numbering 38 species, whilst
of Tepatice T have 18 species, and there is one species of Chara, Lichens are
most abundant of all, there being 75 species, or oyer three-seyenths of the whole
Oryptogams ; whilst Pungs number 8 8pecies, freshwater 4g@ 13, and I have only
39 8pecies of marine Algae.
