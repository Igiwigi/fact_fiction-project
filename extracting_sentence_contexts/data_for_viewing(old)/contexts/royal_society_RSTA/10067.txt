The curve C’B’A of fig. 27, IV., is plotted from numbers calculated in this way for
a=6°5. It is assumed that the rate of cooling is sufficiently slow to ensure that all
the crystals at any temperature contain the same percentage of nickel.

§ 5. The first conclusion from the curve C’B’A is that, in an alloy containing
6°5 per cent. of nickel, the amount of magnetic iron will increase rapidly at first as
the temperature falls below 600° C., and then more gradually. The final portions of
the alloy will become magnetic very slowly, and the return to the magnetic state of
all the iron in the alloy will not be complete until the temperature is below the
ordinary temperature of the air. This accounts for the fact, carefully examined in the
first experiments with the meteoric iron (1st winding) and corroborated subsequently,
that the permeability during cooling, eg., at 550°C., is considerably below that shown
at the same temperature during reheating from 15°C. The fact is less obvious in


METEORIC AND ARTIFICIAL NICKEL-IRON ALLOYS. 87

the case of the artificial nickel steel. Thus, considering only the curves given by
Hopkinson and the corresponding curves of fig. 18, it would appear that all the iron
had become magnetic when, during cooling, the temperature had fallen to about 550° C.
But the later measurements show that the material is not in a state of final
equilibrium at temperatures below 600° C. until it has undergone successive alternations
between that temperature and 15° C., and that, when this state is considered, the
behaviour of the steel is analogous to that of the meteoric iron (ef: § 12 below, p. 92).
