In particular, since Wasserstein distances metrize weak convergence in the sense of measures,
the Euler vorticity distribution w(t) converges weakly to the point vortex measure )7; aj5y,(4). Our
result provides in addition an estimate on the convergence rate, which, up to an exponentially in
time diverging prefactor, remains of the order of ¢ as for the initial datum, see (2.6). Furthermore,
the estimate holds true for any solution w satisfying our initial assumptions. As we have written
earlier, this is a remarkable property in light of the fact that it is currently not known whether
solutions to the Euler equations with vorticity in L? are unique, if p < oo. As solutions to the point


vortex system (2.12) are unique, our result shows that in any case uniqueness is in some sense
recovered in the limit as ¢ > 0.

We remark that the estimate in corollary 2.2 can be interpreted as a stability estimate for the
Euler equation. Indeed, as observed by Schochet [26], the point vortex system can be considered
as a very weak solution to the Euler equation (in the sense of Delort [27]). Adopting this point
of view, our result provides a stability estimate between a distributional solution and an even
weaker solution, which, however, carries more structure. Notice that general stability estimates
for the Euler equation are currently still missing. The works closest to this direction include that
