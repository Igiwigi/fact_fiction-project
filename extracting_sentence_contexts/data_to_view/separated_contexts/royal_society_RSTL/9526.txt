Firstly, a brass plate was tried, and its capacity was found less than unity instead
of infinite. Secondly, by varying the distances of the plates of the balance from each other,
different values of the specific inductive capacity of the same glass were obtained. In
fact, it has been shown that the five-plate induction balance cannot be freely relied
upon to give correct values of specific inductive capacity. I conclude that the values I published in 1877 are substantially accurate, whether
the period of discharge be 3g4o7 or 4 second, whether the electromotive force be one
volt per millimetre or 500 volts per millimetre, and that Mr. GorDoxN's different result
is to be explained by a defect in the method he used.

discharged in 555g second.
