On the
other hand, the existence of races of Lucilia sericata which differ in that the sheep-infesting
race possesses the enzyme collagenase which aids in the penetration of intact skins of
animals, whereas the other race does not possess this secretion and confines its activities to
carrion and necrotic tissues (see Messer & McClellan 1935), may provide the solution to
the problem. With the reason for this change in habit, however, we are not immediately concerned. The fact remains that the flies in question can and do breed very readily on carcasses and
must be regarded as primarily carrion-feeders. Hence, the maintenance of their popula-
tions in nature will be determined very largely by the availability of carrion. The majority
of the flies are produced in large numbers from this source, and a certain proportion of the
so-called ‘primary flies’ will attack the living sheep.
