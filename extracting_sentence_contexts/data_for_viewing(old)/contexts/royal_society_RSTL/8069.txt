A law of SavarT, not nearly 80 well known as it ought to be, is in agreement with
equations (5) and, (6). It is an immediate consequence of the principle of dynamical
similarity, of extreme generality, to the effect that similar vibrating bodies, whether they
be gaseous, 8uch as the air in organ-pipes or in the resonators here considered, or solid,
8uch as tuning-forks, vibrate in a time which is directly as their linear dimensions. Of
course the material must, be the same in two cases that are to be compared, and the
geometrical similarity must be complete, extending to the shape of the opening as well
as to the other parts of the resonant yessel. Although the wave-length A is a function
of the size and shape of the resonator only, 7 or the position of the note in the musical
scale depends on the nature of the gas with which the resonator is filled. And it is
important to notice that it is on the nature of the gas in and near the opening that the
note depends, and not on the gas in the interior of the reseryoir, whose inertia does not
come into play during vibrations corresponding to the fundamental note. In fact we

may say that the mass to be moyed is the air in the neighbourhood of the opening, and
that the air in the interior acts merely as a spring in virtue of its resistance to compres-
8ion. Of course this is only true under the limitation specified, that the diameter of the
reservoir is 8mall compared to the quarter waye-length. Whether . this condition is
fulfilled in the case of -any particular resonator is easily 8een, & posteriori, by calcu-
lating the value of a from (6), or by determining it experimentally.
