these two extreme types come the crystals of rubidium nickel selenate, in which the
two forms are more nearly approached in relative size, the g {011} faces being larger

than in potassium nickel selenate but not so large as in cesium nickel selenate. This
will be clearly apparent from the typical crystal of the rubidium salt shown in fig. 3.
The ammonium salt forms crystals of all three types, but the great majority affect
a more or less intermediate habit akin to that of the rubidium salt, while at the same
time showing some idiosyncracies. Fig. 7 shows this well.
