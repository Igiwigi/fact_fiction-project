Equations (4-5) will apply with sufficient accuracy to the problem defined in § 3, in spite
of the fact that the surface traction on one of the major surfaces is — P, since P is very small
compared with T, and T,,.

If the point of the middle surface of the sheet, which is at (p, 0, z) in the deformed state,
is at (7,0, 0) in the undeformed state, so that the undeformed sheet is flat, then we readily
see that
