There are several records of isolated pairs of starlings nesting and rearing their young at
abnormal times of the year. The precision and shortness of the breeding season of the
starling have already been noted, and these make the occurrence of such abnormal cases
all the more remarkable. The instances recorded below have been reported in the British
Isles in autumn and winter, and they probably refer to British starlings. The possibility,
however, must not be overlooked that the birds were actually immigrant Continental
starlings. Pairs of birds have been found nesting successfully in September (Nelson 1907;
Lewis 1933), October (Allen 1933), November (Wade 1910), December (Livens 1931;
Forrest 1940), January (Fortune 1921; Robinson 1923), and March (Astley 1925). It would
appear that in most of these birds the autumn burst of gonad growth had progressed so far
that breeding became possible, and as it is mentioned by some authors that the season was
mild, it may be that this fact in some way helped the abnormal development. In the case
of the birds found nesting in March it is probable that the late winter development had
been unusually precocious. Such autumn and winter breeding is, however, very rare.

(3) CONTINENTAL STARLINGS

The study of the breeding behaviour of the Continental starlings present in this country
in autumn and winter produced results, mainly negative, which are described below. In
order that their significance may be better understood accounts are also given of the
behaviour of the Continental starling on the Continent at these times of the year.
