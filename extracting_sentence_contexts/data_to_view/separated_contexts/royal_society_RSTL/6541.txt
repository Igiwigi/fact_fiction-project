If the pressure p in any number of tubes became great, it would
manifestly produce a reflux in any confluent tube in which the pressure was smaller, and
a consequent. outpouring of water from every pore and crevice on the surface of the
lower regions of a glacier. Such, in fact, must necessarily be the case wherever there
is an internal fluid pressure much exceeding that of the atmosphere, and where all parts
of the mass are permeated by ducts of any kind through which water can flow out of
the mass with little impediment. Hence it appears that if the internal ducts were 8uch as not to impede the currents
passing through them by means of friction, or any kind of capillarity, there might indeed
be large internal pressures, but they would necessarily be accompanied by overflowings
from the superficial pores and crevices in many parts of a glacier. But such a pheno-
menon would be entirely opposed to all observation ; and it is this which constitutes the
proof that there can be no great fluid pressure in the interior of a glacier due to water
contained within it in tubes which exert no sensible retarding effect by friction on the
water running through them.
