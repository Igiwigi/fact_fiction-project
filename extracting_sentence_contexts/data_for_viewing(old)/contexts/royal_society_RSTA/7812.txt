The boundary of the half-section obtained in this way from the loop of the lemnis-
cate of Bernoulli consists, from the analytical point of view, of the three portions

§=0, 0<9<1/2,

n=0, —c# <&<0 (the x-axis from the focus z = ¢ to the leading edge),
n=n/2, —co<&<0(the x-axis from the focus z = ¢ to the trailing edge),
(see fig. 7).

The canonical flexure functions

From the previous remarks we know that w,, 2, and Q, are given by (18-7), (18-9)
and (18-12), and it is readily verified that these do in fact satisfy the conditions along
y = 0. We have now to find the three remaining canonical flexure functions @,, @,

and 2.
If we put O; = Oy, +95
where 0}, = 727/83, (19:1)

then y,, is a plane harmonic function satisfying
Vio = xy? + const.

along the boundary, which becomes

Vj. = const.
