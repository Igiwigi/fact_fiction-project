Slight indications of blue haze are
sometimes 8een ab the tip of this tapering column, due probably to some negative
electricity gathered from the neighbourhood, but not directly discharged from the
opposite terminal. The discharge is, in fact, one which passes into the tube but not
with sufficient force to pass through it, and which accordingly returns by the way by
which it entered. The cause of this recall we shall examine hereafter ; for our present
purposes it suflices to point out, the fact that here we have a discharge from one pole
which is unable to approach near enough to the other -pole to get relief there, and

actually prefers to return by the way it came rather than to pass through the tube to
the other terminal. Such discharges we shall term unipolar discharges. This unipolar discharge is of course intermittent, and therefore sensitive.
