box are compared in the following table. The first column contains the reading of
the slider on the main dial. The second column the observed deflection of the
galvanometer d in equation (1) reduced to ohms by dividing by s. Since s = 167 in
the second series, one unit in the second decimal place of d/s corresponds to nearly
2 seale-divisions deflection observed. The observations were taken to half a scale-
division, but owing to slight variations of sensitiveness and zero it was not considered
worth while to work the values of d/s beyond the nearest hundredth of an ohm.
The next column gives the error dR in ohms of each separate resistance of the main
dial in terms of the mean of the whole, deduced from equations (1) by the aid
of (2) and (3). The fourth column gives the correction dn in ohms to the reading at
each point. This correction is equal to the sum of the errors of all the coils up
to the point considered, subject only to a small correction, called the “ vernier-
correction,” to allow for the fact that the next two coils are shunted by the vernier
dial. The value of the vernier-correction is given by the following expression—

Vernier-correction to reading n = — n (‘38 — 3dR,,,, — 3dR,,,,)/400.

This correction is often negligible when is small, but sometimes reaches ‘5 or °6
of an ohm near the higher readings. The next three columns in the table give the
corresponding values of the same quantities d/s, dR, and dn, deduced from the
readings taken during the second calibration. Comparing the two sets it will be
observed that the discrepancy very rarely exceeds half an ohm, which is only one
part in 200,000 of the whole resistance.
