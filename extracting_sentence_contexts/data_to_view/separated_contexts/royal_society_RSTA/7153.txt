Higgins found that Runge (1908-9) was the first to apply finite
differences to the partial differential equation of Saint-Venant’s torsion problem. Incident-
ally, I must protest against Higgins’s suggestion that there is a contrast between iteration
and what he calls Richardson’s method of ‘normal functions’. For, in fact, I cleaned away
unwanted normal functions by iteration. A PURIFICATION METHOD FOR COMPUTING 487

The present comparison of techniques will, however, relate to my paper of 1910. The
phraseology of cleaning was not then mentioned, but in retrospect it seems appropriate.
