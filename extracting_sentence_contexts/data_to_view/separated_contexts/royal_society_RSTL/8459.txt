7, a well-defined
external circular muscular coat exists, to which are attached the stout bundles of vertical
or dorso-yentral fibres. The dorso-ventral fibres pass between bundles of longitudinal
fibres, just as do the radiating fibres of Bipalium and Rhynchodemus between the super-
ficial longitudinal muscular bundles. The cells of the rod-like bodies lie Jjust beneath
and between the bundles of longitudinal fibres, in fact bear the same relation to them
as in Bipalium and Rhynchodemus. Internally to these well-defined muscular elements,
and between these and the digestive cavity, is an interval filled up with a pulpy tissue,
which is not s0 perfectly differentiated histologically. In this tisxue are embedded the
thread-cells and connective-tissue elements, and in cavities excavated in its 8ubstance the
generative organs and water-vascular system.
