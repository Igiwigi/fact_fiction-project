In these cases the effect of stimulation may be, as we have said, to cause a very
marked increase in the force of contraction both of the auricle and the ventricle,
which may or may not be accompanied by acceleration. In these cases, also, section
of both vagi in the neck does not arrest the vagus action, but may have a markedly
weakening effect on the ventricles, the beat diminishing rapidly in force, so that the
animal may die in less than a quarter of an hour after the nerves have been cut. This
is well shown in Fig. 20, the first part of which shows temporary increase of force of
the contractions of the left ventricle on cutting both vago-sympathetics, this being
followed by rapid progressive weakening of the contractions. The second part of the
figure was taken 30 seconds after the first, and the third and fourth after intervals of â€”
1 minute. The animal died 2-3 minutes after the last tracing was taken.

Now, do the facts stated above prove the existence in the vago-sympathetics of the
fibres which on stimulation increase the force of the auricular and ventricular con-
tractions ? They do, of course, in the case of the ill-conditioned animals from which
the curves 19 and 20 were taken, but, in the case of such animals, it must be kept in
mind that the condition of the heart was found to be different from that, usually met
with, in that the vagus mechanism in the heart itself was in a condition of excitation.
It is, at the same time, difficult to see how the effects just described can be explained
by any excitation of vagus fibres alone, and we conclude, therefore, that there is a
certain amount of evidence pointing towards the ewistence in the vago-sympathetics of
other centrifugal cardiac nerves besides the vagus fibres proper, which other fibres,
upon excitation under certain conditions, cause a marked increase in the force of the
contractions of the auricles and ventricles, and which on being cut may withdraw from
the heart some influence essential to its continued vitality.
