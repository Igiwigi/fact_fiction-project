L. SYNGE ON THE TIGHTNESS OF THE TEETH. 455

centre is the centre of rotation of the tooth, and whose radius is equal to the radius of
gyration about that centre of rotation of a fictitious wire coincident with the section of the
membrane by the plane of the displacement, and having a linear density equal to the cube
of the reciprocal of the thickness of the membrane. The points of maximum pressure are distinguished from the points of minimum pressure
by the fact that at a point of maximum pressure, the tooth approaches the socket as a result
of the displacement, while at a point of minimum pressure. the tooth recedes from the socket. These results are illustrated in fig. 5, in which the arrows indicate the directions in
which the pressure increases. Fig. 5.
