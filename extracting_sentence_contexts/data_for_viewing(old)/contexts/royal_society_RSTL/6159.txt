deflections of the needle amounting to 27', 48', and 1* 37', Another experiment by the

* The formula signifies in fact that the heat evolved by compressing a solid is equivalent to the work
required to compress the yolume of it due to temperature, just as in the case of a perfect elastic fluid, applied
