ther, by an arithmetical calculation, from Sir Iſaac
Newton's propoſitions only, the motion in queſtion
might not be accounted for.

The reſult of this inquiry I ſhould have taken the
liberty to ſend you before now, but that, other things
intervening, I did not think of reviſing and tran-
fcribing it, till lately ; that Mr. Walmeſley having
made me a preſent of his ingenious treatiſe on the
fame ſubje, it appears, that, however Mr. Clairaut's
bypothefis is given up, yet a notion {till preyails, as if
Sir Ifaac Newton's propoſitions, concerning the mo-
tion of ap/ids, were mere mathematical fictions, not
applicable to nature.

How far I have ſucceeded in ſhewing the contrary,
is now ſubmitted to your judgment. And I, at the
fame time, embrace, with pleaſure, an opportunity

of profeſſing myſelf, with the higheſt reſpect,
Reverend' Sir,
Sradiſhall, 6 April,
1750, Your moſt obliged, and
moſt obedient humble ſeryant,
