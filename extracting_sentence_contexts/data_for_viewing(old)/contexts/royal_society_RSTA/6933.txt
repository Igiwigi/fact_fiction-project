level rises at the inner surface and falls at the outer one. Alternatively, if the liquid is con-
tained between the flat bases of two coaxial cylindrical cups and is subjected to a steady
torsional state of flow by uniform rotation of the outer cup, normal tractions are observed
to act on the base of the inner cup. Effects of this type have been termed, variously “Weissen-
berg effects’, ‘cross-elasticity’ and ‘normal stress effects’.

They appear to have first attracted critical scientific attention during the Second World
War. As a result of restrictions on publication then in force, priority of discovery appears to
be somewhat in doubt (see, however, Garner e¢ al. 1950). It is possible, too, that such effects
have been familiar in certain industries for a considerable time. In view of these facts it
appears desirable to describe them by a title which is as non-controversial as possible.
Accordingly, in this paper the term ‘normal stress effects’ will be used. This is equally
applicable on the basis of all the theories for the description and origin of the effects which
have so far been advanced, with the exception of that of Garner etal. (1950). It will, however,
be seen that this latter theory is hardly likely to prove acceptable as an explanation of the
effects observed. The term ‘cross-elasticity’ which has been used by Reiner (1948) pre-
supposes a particular type of phenomenological theory for the effects and, in the present
state of our knowledge, it seems scarcely justifiable to assume its correctness.

In the last few years the study of normal stress effects has attracted a considerable amount
of attention both from the theoretical and experimental point of view. A number of theories °
of a phenomenological character have been advanced. However, in many cases these have
