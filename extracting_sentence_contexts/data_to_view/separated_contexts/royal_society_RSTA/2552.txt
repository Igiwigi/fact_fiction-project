The problems in
d’Alembert’s proof are slightly more serious, but I would assess it as essentially correct, as we
know the later work of Weierstrass. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to Gauf’s first proof, which if not quite false, is
severely problematic. In fact, unlike the two preceding proofs that today can be easily patched
by a first-year undergraduate student, Gauf’s first proof contains a huge gap, that was only
fixed by Ostrowski [6] in 1920, and that even today would be non-trivial to fill for a professional
mathematician outside of the field. Smale [7] describes the situation as follows: ‘I wish to point
out what an immense gap Gauss’s proof contained. It is a subtle point even today that a real
algebraic plane curve cannot enter a disk without leaving.
