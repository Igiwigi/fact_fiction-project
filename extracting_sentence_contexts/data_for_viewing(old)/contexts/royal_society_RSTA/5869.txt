Ly(v + dx) =((Vxv) x u) - dx+d(u-v), (4.32)
the Lie derivatives in (4.31) can be written as
Ly(f x x) + dx) =2(f x ul). dx +d(.), (4.33)
Ly (ue . dx) =Lye(u® dx) +L,5 (ue - dx)
= (uP. vuF) «det ((Vxu) x u8)) - dx +d), (4.34)
where we do not detail the exact differentials. This makes it possible to rewrite (4.31) as
du + (aE - V)u® + x (uF + 3) =-Vo+ uy x (V x uF), (4.35)

for a suitable definition of the effective pressure w. Equation (4.35) can be recognized as the
CL equation [3,4,28] with the solenoidal Stokes velocity us, replacing u°. This is not surprising
since the O(e?,) difference between us, and u® is of the same order as terms neglected in the
derivation of the CL equation. (CL geared 1 to by taking js = €”. In our derivation, this gearing
is not necessary.) In fact the assumption 1 <1 is only used to neglect the term (4.30) from the
Lagrangian-mean momentum equation to obtain (4.31) and hence (4.35). Restoring this term leads
to the generalization

(81 + Lyp)(w® » dx + 4d (O¢1qyI2) + 4(f x x) » dx) =—da", (4.36)

of the CL equation valid for 4 = O(1). Since Lub and d commute, L,.4(011q;) = d(---) and the
additional terms involving |q,|7 can be absorbed in the differential of the pressure-like term on
the right-hand side. We conclude that the CL equation (4.35) with uy as Stokes velocity holds for
p2 = O(1) provided that the effective pressure @ is suitably redefined.
