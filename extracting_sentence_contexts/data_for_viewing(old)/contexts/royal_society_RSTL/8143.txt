new vessels in the open space between them, thus obyiously being instrumental in
repairing the breach in the continuity of the cylinder and closing it up by a swecession
of exogenous additions. It has not completely effected this object in the specimen
under consideration, but apparently would have done 80 in the course of time had the
plant survived sufficiently long for the purpose. Another remarkable cireumstance
appears in the fact that the two ligneous axes, though growing within the same stem,
are not growing in equal ratios. Thus that to the lower part of Plate XLIIL. fig. 20 is
invested by the new layer just described, showing that in it an additional growth was
progressing through the agency of some representative of a cambium-layer ; but in the
twin axis above no such addition is in progress. TI presume we can only infer from this
fact that at the particular moment when the living plant was destroyed the former
branch was pushing forward in a more active manner than the latter oneâ€”a condition
common enough amongst recent plants, in which one Lycopodiaceous $hoot takes the
lead, whilst others are comparatively quiescent.

At the outset of my study of the Burntisland beds my attention was arrested by the
prevalence, #n every fraqment of the stratum, of broken-up cellular sporangia, indicating
the former existence of very numerous spore-bearing fruits; I also met with immense
