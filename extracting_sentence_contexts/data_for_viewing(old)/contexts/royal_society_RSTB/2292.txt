VIII. Depuctions FRoM THE CASE.

From the report of the case it is evident that the peripheral segment of the
facial nerve had made an efficient union with the spinal accessory nerve. There is
also no doubt that the recovery of function was due to impulses transmitted along
the spinal accessory, and not to a reunion of the peripheral with the central segment
of the facial nerve. This latter possibility was rendered extremely unlikely by the
fact that the facial nerve was cut close to its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen,
and that, between the cut central end and the point of attachment of the peripheral
end of the facial to the spinal accessory, there lay the posterior belly of the digastric.
In the experiments on dogs the anconeus muscle formed an efficient barrier against
the possibility of confluent reunion, and the same no doubt was fulfilled by the
digastric. That the facial nerve was now a branch of the spinal accessory was
rendered certain when it was discovered that on raising the right arm suddenly, the
muscles of the side of the face were thrown into contractions. This could not have
been, if the spinal accessory impulses did not reach the face. That no reunion had
taken place between the two ends of the facial, was shown by the absence of all
contractions in the facial muscles on stimulating over the normal motor point for the
facial nerve, which on the sound side was situated close under the ear. On the
affected side the motor point was situated nearly 2 centims. lower, and, there-
