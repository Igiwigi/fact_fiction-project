more soundly based. The form of the centre-system in which we find generic
characters, and the details of this and of the branch-systems which define the
species, are characters that arise early in life, are constant in both sexes, and persist
unchanged.

As an example of the constancy of this centre- and branch-system, we may refer to
the result obtained on the commonest marine Macromysis.

It is held by Sars and Norman™ that there are two close-allied species of this
genus, M. flecuosa and M. neglecta. The distinguishing characters are such that
only adults can be satisfactorily determined. V/. neglecta, however, has on the
average a smaller number of tarsal joints and a shorter antennulary peduncle, as
compared with its antennary scale. In fact, it is altogether a smaller animal than
M. flexuosa, Thé differences appeared to be largely explicable as stages of growth
of one form. Most systematists have, however, found it impossible to identify
specimens of Mysis with M. neglectu.

We have examined the chromatophore-system and find that in specimens referable
to M. flexuosa two clearly distinct types of centre- and branch-systems occur. Each
breeds true. Each possesses before birth its own system of centres and branches,
which persist throughout life in both sexes. The chief difference is that in one type
the neural centres are paired throughout the thoracic region ; but only occur opposite
to the third, sixth and eighth appendages in the other type. The first type we call
M. flexwosa, the second M. nigra. The reason for retaining the name for the first
type is because the first figuret of “ cancer flexuosus ” shows the chromatophores
