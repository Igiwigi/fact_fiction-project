If the breadth of slit occupied 5° of the annulus, the difference between the mean
of the marginal intensities and that of the actual central intensity would be ‘2 per
cent. ‘The true mean of all the rays would be less than these figures. A slit of 5°
width would, therefore, be admissible to use as giving an error much less than that
found in observations—as a matter of fact, the slit was always considerably narrower
than this, so that no appreciable error can be found on this account. 4, New Extinction Box. In Part III. of ‘Colour Photometry ” a diagram is given of an “ extinction box,”
and also of the curves of extinction of the visible spectrum for various classes of
colour vision, For the greater part of the experiments the box was slightly altered,
so far as regards the method of admitting the light.
