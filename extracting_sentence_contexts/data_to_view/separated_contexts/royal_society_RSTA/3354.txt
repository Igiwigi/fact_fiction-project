Therefore, if on the one hand it is improbable that [8

life descended from more than a single ancestor, it is clear, on the other, that that single ancestor
should possess everything that is shared by extant life, not least the ribosome and the rest of the
apparatus of genetic-code-driven protein synthesis. Much of the evolution of LUCA has been clarified in light of the discovery that even distantly
related organisms can directly exchange genetic material via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Indeed, the past 20 years have seen an increased interest in the fact that (mostly) Bacteria and
Archaea can perform HGT, by means of which they transfer genes conferring antibiotic resistance
and the ability of metabolize alternative sources of carbon and energy. The role of HGT becomes,
however, more controversial in the study of the evolution of early life, as it led to question the
very foundation of the tree-like structure of the evolutionary relationship among species [29]. In
fact, the key assumption for constructing phylogenetic trees is that similarities between genes
(or genomes) allow one to infer the parent-to-offspring relationship among organisms.
