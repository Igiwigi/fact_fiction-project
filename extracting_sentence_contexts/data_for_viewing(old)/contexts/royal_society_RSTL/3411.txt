years called the attention of physiologists, and thus their real structure eluded him#,
Foxraxa was the first to give what has seemed to me to be the correct explanation
of their nature, where he says, © Les fils charnus primitifs (prim. fibrillze) sont des
cylindres solides, 6gaux entreux, et marqu6s visiblement a distances 6gales de petits
signes, comme dautant de petits diaphragms ou rides. Je ai pit apperceyoir dans ces
fils une marche vraiment ond6e et il m'a paru que les petites taches curvilignes du
faisceau primitif 6taient form6es par les petits signes ou diaphragms des fils charnus
primitifs+.”

It is difficult to conceive how the strizz should have escaped the observation of Sir
E. Hows and Mr. Bavgs, when investigating the structure of muscle, bat such seems
to be the fact. In the last ten or fifteen years, during which s0 much more attention
has been given to microscopical researches, various observers have noticed them, and
attempted to explain their composition. Among these, Dr. Hopcxin and Mr. LisveR
describe them, but offer no opinion as to their nature. Dr. Scuwanx adduces several
reasons for thinking them formed by the lateral parallelism of the beads of conti-
guous fibrillzeef. MULLER adopts this explanation, and M. Laura holds the same
viewh. Mr. Sksy, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1837, advances a directly op-
posite opinion. He says that the fibres (primitive fasciculi) are in reality tubes, con-
taining a soluble gluten, round which the fibrillee are arranged in sets ; that these are
finally surrounded, bound together, and retained in their position by the transverse
strize, © which are the woof to the warp of the longitudinal filaments, but instead of
being interlaced with them, they form circles around, and attached to the most promi-
nent part of the longitudinal filaments, to which they are intimately united.” (p.375.)
