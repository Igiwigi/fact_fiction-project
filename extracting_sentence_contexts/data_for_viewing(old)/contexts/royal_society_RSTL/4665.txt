although simple, appears to admit of sufficient exactness, It enables us to make a
new class of observations which can be expressed in numbers, and of which a vast
variety of substances may be the object, in fact everything soluble, Diffusion is also
a property of a fundamental character, upon which other properties depend, like the
volatility of substances ; while the number of substances which are soluble and there-
fore diffusible, appears to be much greater than the number of volatile bodies.

2. The novel scale of Solution Densities, which are suggested by the different dif-
fusibilities of salts, and to which alone, guided by the analogy of gaseous diffusion,
we can refer these diffasibilities. Liquid diffusion thus supplies the densities of anew
kind of molecules, but nothing more respecting them.

The fact that the relations in diffusion of different substances refer to equal
weights of those substances, and not to their atomic weights or equivalents, is one
which reaches to the very basis of molecular chemistry. The relation most frequently
possessed is that of equality, the relation of all others most easily observed. In liquid
diffusion we appear to deal no longer with chemical equivalents or the Daltonian atoms,
but with masses even more simply related to each other in weight. Founding till
upon the chemical atoms, we may suppose that they can group together in snch
numbers as to form new and larger molecules of equal weight for different snb-
stances, or if not of equal weight, of weights which appear to have a simple relation
to each other. It is this new class of molecules which appear to play a part in soJu-
bility and liquid diffusjon, and not the atoms of chemical combination.

3. The formation of classes of equi-diffusive substances. These classes are evi-
