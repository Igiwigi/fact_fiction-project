After these trials had been made, I determined, with Professor ReyNnoups, by
means of a spring balance, the force necessary to move the bottom cock, This was
found to amount to a moment of 30 ft.-lbs. on the brake, and on this account this
series of trials, though appearing in the final tables, have not been allowed any
weight in the calculation of the final mean value of K. The preliminary reduction
of Table A gave what were apparently very good values of K, but this only shows
the small effect on the mean moment produced by variations in the resistance
offered to the brakeâ€™s motion, and this although its period of oscillation was very
long.

Series VI.

41. These trials differ from those of Series V. only in the fact that the extra

packing had been removed from the gland on the cock spindle, while a means of
catching the whole of the leakage, and at the same time preventing its evaporation,
had been provided (par. 14). The whole of the leakage was credited with the
temperature of the water in the discharge pipe, and was weighed with the main
stream of water which had been caught in the tank.

Series VIT.
