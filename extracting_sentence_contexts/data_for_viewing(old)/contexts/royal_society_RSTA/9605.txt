and 8 as shown in the table. It will be seen that, taking the 1929 value for B. 299
and the 1934 value for B. 188 at an anode potential of 60 volts in each case, the
ratio of the sensitivities should be 3-26/3-55, i.e., B. 299 should have only 0-917 of

the sensitivity of B. 188. The ratio found in daylight was 0-924, so that here again
we have excellent evidence of the stability of these cells.

The effect of varying anode potential on B. 299 is well shown. There can be no
doubt but that a potential as high as 120 volts would be advantageous with Burt
cells, especially in very bright light, if it were not for the fact that the relative
importance of leakage currents would be increased by this high voltage. We have
always adopted 60 volts as a convenient standard for emission cells. At this
voltage the change in sensitivity is no more than 0-4 per volt for the Burt cells
and is much less with most of the others, save the large cell X 41.

The effect of arc length is shown by the readings with B. 188, which is very sensitive
to the ultra-violet from the arc itself. It will be seen that there is little difference
between 3 and 4 mm arcs, though the 5 mm are gave an appreciably larger effect,
as shown by the reduced value of the constant in the last column. Where the arc
length is not given it lay between 2-5 and 4 mm.

The results with the caesium monomolecular vacuum cell C.M.V.6 show that
