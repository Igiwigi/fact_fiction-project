The word chiral was introduced by Kelvin to refer
to any geometrical figure or group of points that
cannot be brought into coincidence with its mirror
image, thus possessing a sense of handedness [1].
It derives, in fact, from the Greek for hand: yxeip
(E. Eleftheriadou 2015, private communication). In the
language of point group theory, a chiral form is devoid
of improper rotational symmetry elements [2]. The word
dissymmetry was used by Pasteur to convey this more
negative perspective [3,4]. Barron effectively extended
Kelvin’s definition of chirality to include time in addition
to space by distinguishing between ‘true’ and ‘false’
chirality, the former being exhibited by systems that
can exist in two distinct enantiomeric (enantiomorphic)
