values given by (10). These functions and their derivatives are calculable from the

preceding tables, at the values of 6 taken. Tables XX. to XXIII.* give steps in the
necessary computations, and figs. 5 to 12 show the results plotted against 6 from 0°
to 150°. These curves show that for this range the first approximation is very good
for Z,, Z,. In fact, the curves for &, & were easily drawn and gave interpolated values
of Z,, Z, to three places of decimals, the last figure being approximate. The functions
m,n, have a greater number of oscillations and greater amplitudes, and there was in
places some little doubt as to the exact forms of the curves. By careful examination
and comparison of corresponding curves for the two cases of xa =9 and 10, this
difficulty was overcome. Such a comparison was more fruitful when the curves were
plotted with 6 as abscisse, and this was done with », m, &, &, though the curves are
not given below. Corresponding curves are very similar but are not in phase with
each other. In the range 6 = 0° to 90°, it was found possible to obtain Y,, Y, to at
least two places of decimals, with very little doubt.

It was the work just described which led to the detection of errors mentioned in
§§ 1, 8, How this was possible becomes evident on an examination of the formule
