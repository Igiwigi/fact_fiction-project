It is to be noticed that these calculated pressures are in substantial agreement
with my experiments on the fracturing of glass tubes by the explosion of carbonic
oxide and of cyanogen with oxygen ; and also that the minimum pressures calculated
for the diluted electrolytic gas are close to 30 atmospheres—the pressure required to
- fire electrolytic gas by the heat of compression.

In 1859 Riewann* deduced an equation for the propagation of abrupt variations in the density and
pressure of a gas, on the supposition that such an abrupt variation could be propagated without change
of type. Lord Rayieicnt criticising this investigation, draws attention to the fact that a steady wave

is only possible for a particular relation between the pressure and density of the gas, which is different
from the one actually holding. In the case of the explosion-waves it seems possible, however, that the
temperature, pressure, and density of the gas should so adjust themselves as to make RieMany’s equations
applicable. In fact, they must do so if the front of the wave keeps its type, which it probably does
when the velocity has become constant.
