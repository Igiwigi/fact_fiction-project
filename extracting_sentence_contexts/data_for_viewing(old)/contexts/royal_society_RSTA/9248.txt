observations. In the hypsometer one of the Tonnelot thermometers was replaced by
a small maximum thermometer, which was supported in an inverted position with just
the bulb (about 1 cm. long) exposed. The reading recorded was 94° C. We may take
it, therefore, that the temperature of the emergent column of a Tonnelot thermometer
is not lower than 94°C. and is probably considerably higher. Taking, therefore,
94° C. and assuming 0-7° C. emergent, we get about 0-0007° C. as an upper limit to
the emergent column error. Hvidently, then, all errors due to stem exposure will be
quite negligible.

VITI.— Results.

Before considering the main results of the intercomparison, it will be convenient to
refer to some incidental facts which were disclosed during the observations.

As has been stated earlier, the observations on the ice point were all made by measure-

* It was not thought necessary to carry out more extended re-calibration of the bore, since below 50° C, an
error of 0-014° C, in a single thermometer would be necessary to affect the final mean by as much as0-O001° C,
