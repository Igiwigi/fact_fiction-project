8urface of the uplifted mass through the medium of 80me Fluid, which may be conceived
to be an elastic vapour, or, in other cases, a mass of matter in a state of fusion from
heat. Every geologist, I conceive, who admits the action of 4 forces at all will
be disposed to admit the legitimacy of these assumptions. : The first effort of our
elevatory force will of course be to raise the mass under which it acts, and to place it in
a state of extension, and consequently of tens70n.

21. If this fundamental notion be (as the writer believes it is) erroneous and opposed
toall the facts observable in the great regions of elevation, . 6. in the mountain-chains of
the world, then it must be admitted that the speculations which follow as to the forma-
tion of fissures &c. (in a word, the substance of the doctrines of this paper, however
ingenious as a mathematical exercise) have no true reference to the facts as occurring in
nature, and, promulgated with the authority of the author and with that sort of oracular
sanction which mathematical symbols possess for those who are devoid of mathematical
knowledge, have tended materially to retard the progress of a truer interpretation of
elevatory forces.

22. If we were to assume (as has been done) that the appearance of the masses of the
great continents above the sea-level was a work of elevation at all, it might be a case to
which Mr. Horx1xs's notion could perhaps apply. But that the great continents have
not been the work of such eleyatory forces at all, but have resulted from the deformation
