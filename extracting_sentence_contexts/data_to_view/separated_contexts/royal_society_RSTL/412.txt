Tax discovery of the polarisation of light by reflexion, con-
stitutes a memorable epoch in the history of optics; and the
name of MaLvs, who first made known this remarkable pro-
perty of bodies, will be for ever associated with a branch of
science which he had the sole merit of creating. By a few
brilliant and comprehensive experiments he established the
general fact, that light acquired the same property as one of
the pencils formed by double refraction, when it was reflected
at a particular angle from the surfaces of all transparent
bodies: he found that the angle of incidence at which this
property was communicated, was greater in bodies of a
high refractive power, and he measured, with considerable
accuracy, the polarising angles for glass and water. In order
to discover the law which regulated the phenomena, he com-
pared these angles with the refractive and dispersive powers
of glass and water, and finding that there was no relation be-
tween these properties of transparent bodies, he draws the
following general conclusion. ©
