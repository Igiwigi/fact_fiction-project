2. Major motivating questions at the outset of OSNAP

The motivation for OSNAP that I offered in the previous section focused on what we were
learning about the subtropical AMOC from the RAPID array and about the subtropical/subpolar
divide from modelling studies and Lagrangian observations. However, OSNAP was also
motivated in large part by observations in the subpolar North Atlantic that did not square with
our expectations in the early part of this century. Specifically, we expected at that time that
downstream DWEC variability was a measure of AMOC variability [17] and that convection
variability in the Labrador Sea was driving that AMOC variability. Observations showed
otherwise. Specifically, measurements of the boundary currents east of the Grand Banks at 43° N
during 1993 to 1995 and then again from 1999 to 2001 showed that transport in the LSW density
range was remarkably steady despite the fact that LSW production was considerably weaker
during the latter time period [17-20]. Similarly, a strengthening of the Deep Labrador Current
at 53°N was recorded over the time period of a well-documented decrease in convection [21].
Finally, transport measurements of the DWBC equatorward of the Grand Banks appeared weaker
when it advected a larger fraction of LSW [22].

One possible reason for the apparent disconnect between convection in the Labrador Sea and
DWEC variability was that not all export pathways of these dense waters had been monitored in
these studies. Though the DWBC had traditionally been considered the sole conduit for the lower
limb of the AMOC, observational and modelling studies, as mentioned above, were revealing the
importance of interior, as well as boundary, pathways [13,23-25]. In short, we could no longer be
certain that DWBC variability was a reflection of AMOC variability. This uncertainty underscored
the need for a trans-basin measure of the AMOC.
