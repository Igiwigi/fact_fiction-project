the same kind. It is not a constant feature of this condition of the sac, nor has it been
observed in a later stage.

Each of the four nuclei in fig. 16 is surrounded by dense cytoplasm, outside which
there is a marked development of small vacuoles. The absence of a large central
vacuole, which was formerly} stated to be a constant feature of the free-nucleate

condition, is confirmed. This can only mean that, in proportion to the increase in the
area of the macrospore-wall, the growth of the cytoplasm proceeds more rapidly than
is usual among Gymnosperms. Whether this is due to an abnormally rapid formation
of new cytoplasm, or to an unusually slow increase in the peripheral area of the sac,
or to both, is not certain. The small size of the sac at the time of its septation,
together with the fact that the vacuole is similarly absent in Gnetum when the normal
growth of the sac is hindered,{ favours the second view. Other evidence, however,
makes it probable that the absence of the vacuole is, in part at least, directly due to
the rapid growth of the cytoplasm and multiplication of the nuclei. In a cone, most
of whose ovules already contain embryos, a few near the apex are still in early stages
of development. In these the free nucl√©i always show a tendency to confine
themselves to a lining layer of cytoplasm and the development of vacuoles is much
greater than in corresponding stages in younger cones (fig. 17). This appears to
be a natural consequence of the impaired vegetative activity of the old cone in
