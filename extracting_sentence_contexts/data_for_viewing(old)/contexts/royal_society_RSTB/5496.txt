ferns Zalesskya and Thamnopteris, from the Permian of Western Siberia.

Asterochlanopsis thus constitutes, on the one hand, an interesting link between
Asterochlana and Ankyropteris, and, on the other, an additional piece of evidence for
a common origin of the Zygopterideze and Osmundacee.

A further result of the present investigation touches the question of nomenclature
and classification in the Zygopteridex. Some years ago, it was shown that two such
distinct types of petiole as those of “ Clepsydropsis ” australis and Ankyropteris grayt
may be borne upon stems having an almost identical type of stele. And now we
learn that two petioles, so closely similar as those of ‘‘ Clepsydropsis ” australis and the
Siberian plant (hitherto regarded as a species of Clepsydropsis) actually belong to two
generally distinct types of stem. Facts of this kind are a forcible reminder that however
useful leaf characters may be in the classification of this family, they may sometimes be
very misleading.

The discovery that rachises with typical “ Clepsydropsis”” bundles may be borne
upon such different kinds of stems throws into suspicion the affinities of the fragmentary
remains on which the genus Clepsydropsis was founded by UNcEr. A revision of part
of the material originally described by Unarr, and later by others, seems to indicate
that Uncrr’s Clepsydropsis belonged to a plant which was generically distinct from
both the Siberian and the Australian Zygopterids, and was possibly not a Zygopterid
at all. In spite of their “ Clepsydropsis ” petioles, the claim of these two ferns to that
generic name is thus seriously in question. One of them has now been transferred to
the new genus Asterochlenopsis ; the other is being retained only very provisionally
