PART ITI—ORGANIC PEROXIDES
By A. R. UsBELonDE and A. Ecrrron, F.R.S.

1—INTRODUCTION

Apart from general theories of hydrocarbon combustion and in spite of the main
conclusion of Part II as to the nature of the “‘ peroxides,” certain experimental facts
indicated that organic peroxides might still have an important connection with the
phenomenon of “ knock.”

a These indications were that :—(1) organic peroxides were found to be pro-
“nounced “ pro-knock”’ substances ; (2) metallic anti-knocks markedly inhibited
8 their effect ; (3) the detonationof hydrogen was not prevented by metallic anti-knocks ;
9 (4) the effect on the KI “ droplet ’’ was not always accounted for entirely by the NO,,
@ particularly in the neighbourhood of the top dead centre ; (5) metallic anti-knocks
© inhibit the ignition of hydrocarbon mixtures, and particularly seem to counteract
P the effect of pressure, which should favour the formation of peroxides ; (6) the use
sof fuels with more than 15 times the maximum aldehyde formed in the cylinder did
8 not enhance the “ knock” and alcohols do not knock, so that no main product formed
during the course of the reactions postulated by the hydroxylation theory seems to
“a explain it; (7) cyclohexane and other fuels can be made to knock if the cylinder
3 temperature is raised. The large amount of NO, formed with this substance under
Snormal conditions, and other effects, indicate that NO, itself has only a secondary
‘3 influence on “ knock” with hydrocarbons. & It seemed worth while, therefore, to pursue the matter further.
