p(t, —Xy
(t—R large, (t—R)/R small). (87)

For a point of very large R the approximation (86) will become valid when ¢— R becomes
large and will in fact remain valid thereafter. However, in the early stages of its validity it
will be simpler to use the form (87), whilst ultimately the more convenient solution (73)
becomes valid. It will be noted that the form (86) and its special case (87) involve arguments of Q from
0 to t—R, but, in general, these forms are only strictly valid when the contributions from
large arguments predominate.
