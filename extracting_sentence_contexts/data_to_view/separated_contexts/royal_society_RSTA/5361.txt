Let the atom be in a medium with refractive index n and moving with
velocity v away from a source of light with angular frequency w. The atom can
absorb a photon from the beam if the Doppler-shifted frequency matches the
transition frequency, so that

nv

wy xo (1- =). (1.11)
Cc

Let v’ denote the velocity of the atom after it has absorbed the photon. The

conservation of energy and of momentum then require that

1 1
ym + hao = ym + ho (1.12)

and
t
mv’ = Mv + Pphoton- (1.13)

Solving these for the photon momentum gives

hon 2v han
Pphoton = — y
P v+u' c

where we have made use of the fact that the absorption makes only a small change
to the velocity of the atom. Simple conservation laws have led us to conclude that
the photon momentum is that given by Minkowski. These arguments in support of the Minkowski momentum are of a different
character from that made in support of the Abraham form, but they are no less
convincing for that.
