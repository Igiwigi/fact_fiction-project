Briefly: the generalized free product in question exists if, and only if, there is a group P" which has the
isomorphism property as well as the weak intersection property. (8-4)

Proof. The necessity of the stated condition for the existence of the generalized free product
is seen from the fact that this has itself the isomorphism and intersection properties. The
sufficiency follows from theorems (8-1), (8°21) and (8-22); we only have to show that
theorem (8-22) applies, that is to say, that the weak intersection property (8-3) of P”
together with the isomorphism property implies the strong intersection property. Let then

As 7, is an isomorphism, gy, has only a single original g, and this then lies in 1/,,. Thus P”
has the strong intersection property, and the theorem follows.
