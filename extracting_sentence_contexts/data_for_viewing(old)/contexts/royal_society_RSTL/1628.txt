servations arising out of this enquiry. |

There is a simple mode of liquifying the gases, which at
first view appears paradoxical, namely, by the application of
heat ; it consists in placing them in one leg of a bent sealed
tube confined by mercury, and applying heat to ether, or
alcohol, or water, in the other end. In this manner, by the
pressure of the vapour of ether I have liquified prussic gas
and sulphureous acid gas, the only two on which I have
made experiments; and these gases in being reproduced
occasioned cold.

There can be little doubt that these general facts of the
condensation of the gases will have many: practical applica-
tions. They offer easy methods of impregnating liquids
with carbonic acid and other gases, without the necessity of
common mechanical pressure.

They afford means of producing great diminutions of tem-
perature, by the rapidity with which large quantities of
| liquids may be rendered aeriform ; and as compression  oc-
casions similar effects to cold, in preventing the formation of
elastic substances, there is great reason to believe that it
may be successfully employed for the preservation of ani-
mal and vegetable substances for the purposes of food.
