Except in February and December and from July to October, when
it is equal to that of Goalpara (in the last month somewhat higher), the mean humidity
of the hill-station is from 1 to 5 per cent. less than that of the As8am valley. A similar
relation is 8hown, but far more decidedly, by Hazareebagh, which from October to May
has a drier atmosphere, not only than Calcutta and Cuttack, but even than Patna, 120
miles further inland: from October to April its humidity ranges below that of Jubbul-
pore, although it is less than 700 feet higher. TI should not indeed venture to infer
from this fact that in a yertical column of the atmosphere over the plains the relative
humidity of the atmosphere would be found in the cold and early hot-weather months
lower than near the land-surface, to any thing like the extent shown by the Hazareebagh
registers. The situation of this station on the highest part of a dry plateau, freely
absorbing and emitting the solar heat, while it affords little evaporation, presents condi-
tions very different from thoge of the free atmosphere ; and probably by raising the tempe-
Tature raises the tension of saturation, while it raises that of the vapour actually in the
air only in about the same ratio as that of dry air. But I have already noticed this
snbject in a previous part of this paper.
