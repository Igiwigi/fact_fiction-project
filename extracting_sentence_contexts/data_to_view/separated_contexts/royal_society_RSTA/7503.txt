Moreover, in such cases, the induced currents can be
determined by solving the above equations for A,, without further considering y. It
will, however, be noted that this does not imply that electrostatic effects are ignored ;

4. CONDUCTORS WITH SPHERICAL SYMMETRY

We shall now show that there is a solution of the above special form when the con-

ductor is a sphere, with « a function of the distance r from the centre. If there is such a

solution corresponding to a given inducing field, it will be unique, because, if two

different solutions were found, their difference would, since the equations are linear,
correspond to a zero inducing field.
