firing rates per cell during offline states as were observed
during online statesâ€”but without specified temporal
sequence patterns. Often non-report of sequence repetition
in reactivation experiments may be owing to lack of sequence
examination by researchers.

Therefore, spike sequences (timing but not based on prior
events) and reactivation (recapitulation of prior rates but not
necessarily timing) can be considered to be sub-elements of
full replay.

Finally, replay of waking sequences during offline states
may or may not be influenced by recent experience. In fact,
much replay, especially in the cortex occurs in a manner
that does not appear to be influenced by recent experience
but rather recapitulates some default network state and
therefore may not relate to a memory consolidation role.

The rodent hippocampus is the neural structure in which
replay is best studied and work there serves as an important
guide to cortical spike sequence researchers. As a result,
we will briefly review that literature before proceeding to
neocortical experiments.
