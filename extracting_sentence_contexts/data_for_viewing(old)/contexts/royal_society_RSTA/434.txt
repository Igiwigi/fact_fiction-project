Almost a decade has passed since the final report of the Ziirich G experiment was published. In
this decade, our experience and views evolved and in hindsight we would like to give an honest
assessment of certain features of the experiment. From this vantage point, different aspects seem
more important than in the past when all of us were immersed in performing or analysing the
experiment.

(a) Calibration

The strongest point of the experiment is that it has a traceable and credible calibration. In §3,
most details on the calibration of the balance are given. The calibration was performed in situ.
Furthermore, unlike in most torsion balance experiments, the calibration was performed in the
same mode, i.e. the configuration of the experiment remained the same. Another interesting
aspect of this experiment is the fact that the calibration takes advantage of gravitation itself. The
gravitational force between a known mass and the Earth was used. This is in contrast to torsion
balances, which are often calibrated using electrostatic forces.

(b) Nonlinearity

In 1995, Kuroda pointed out [28] a nonlinear effect in torsion balances that could lead to a
significant systematic bias in the so-called time of swing method. This nonlinearity arises from
anelasticity [29] in the torsion fibre, i.e. the torsional spring constant is a function of frequency
and can add a relative systematic bias up to 10~* to these experiments. With Kuroda’s publication


nonlinearity became a prime concern in experiments determining the gravitational constant. Ee
