plexus. Although the main body of the cell is set almost at right angles to the
longitudinal axis of the optic cup, the sharply attenuated inner ends bend round so
as to lie along its longitudinal axis. Characteristic of the pigmented cell is the
development, in the peripheral part of its substance, of pigment in the form of small
granules which, though soluble in acetic acid (fig. 19, left-hand side cup), remain
visible after treatment with osmic fixatives (right-hand side cup). The pigment is
restricted in distribution to the outer third of the cell, the nucleus of which is situated
in the non-pigmented portion.

Interpolated between the pigmented cells of the optic cup are numerous bodies
which must be regarded as constituting the visual cells of the cup. The visual
elements are most difficult to demonstrate, and are not visible at all after fixation
with non-osmic fixatives (fig. 19, left-hand cup). They have, in fact, not been seen
in their entirety in any one preparation, and it must be pointed out here that the
interpretation of their structure, as indicated in fig. 19 (right-hand side cup), has
been arrived at by the study of many series of sections of F.W.A. fixed material, after
treatment with a variety of stains. The visual sensory cell is divided into two well-
defined regionsâ€”a peripheral portion (oft. ves.), projecting into the cavity of the cup,
and a sensory portion (oft. s.c.), intruding between the pigment cells. The former
is seen to best advantage in iron-alum haematoxylin preparations, after F.W.A.
fixation, when it appears as a very lightly staining vesicle, slightly swollen at its free
end and projecting for a distance of about 4-5 yu into the cavity ofthe cup. Although
the vesicle is almost transparent, its outlines are well defined, and its shape is not in
any way variable. This is important because of the possibility of mistaking the
vesicles for droplets of secretion in the process of being exuded into the cavity. The
