While & = L@ ina linear case, as
a more general rule

P (i max) = Lo(Gmax)q + Log? + Lag? +--+ - (3.1)
The constants L; are used to build an odd Taylor series approximating the nonlinear behaviour : =
of a magnetic field subjected to saturation. Also note, in Lo(Gmax), the dependence on qmax, which : =
refers to the maximum amplitude of the current q. This represents the fact that, even before 1B
saturation, we observe a variation of the inductance that does not directly depend on q but on its : =
maximum value. In practice, inductors made of ferrite magnetic material generate an equivalent : a
inductance which first increases before saturation occurs. At such a low current, the relationship Dy
between Â© and q remains linear but the slope increases with the amplitude of the electrical : 2
current [28].
