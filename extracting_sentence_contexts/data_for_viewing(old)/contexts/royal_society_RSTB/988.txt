T.—The growth of the stroma. Figs. 2, 15, 16.

ee changes are now seen in the mucosa. ‘The first of these is a gradual increase
» density of the stroma in the superficial third of the mucosa ; the second, an
» in the size of the blood vessels, and the third, an interglandular swelling of
sa into the lumen of the uterus in the form of ridges or hillocks.

e growth of the stroma.—The increase in density of the stroma comes about
ally. Tt is due to the increase in number of the nuclei of that layer by means
jon, and to the fact that they are packed closely together. That is to say,
asia occurs.

T have before remarked, no definite division of this tissue into separate cells is
. and the protoplasmic network is always continuous. When nuclei divide
geparate, they carry with them a portion of the protoplasm which originally
ganded the parent nucleus, but this protoplasm is never thus entirely separated,
Sanerely extended, and no actual division of a cell is seen. In speaking of the

aShistology of the stroma, however, I have sometimes referred to the individual

i with the protoplasm immediately surrounding them as cells.
multiplication takes place by simple division of a nucleus into two, and
