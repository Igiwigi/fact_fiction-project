gram. This would suggest that depth scales linearly with
disparity, so that doubling the disparity doubles the perceived
depth. By contrast, because they have the same disparity, on a
triangulation account, you might expect the top (nearer) of the
stacked half-size stereograms to look flatter than the bottom
(further) half-size stereogram. But this doesn’t appear to be
the case (figure 9), even if you move your face extremely
close to the display to maximize the difference.
