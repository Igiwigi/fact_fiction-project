It is quite certain that any such operand
must possess at least two properties in common with the exponential function : (i) its
first term must be unity ; (ii) it must contain an infinite number of terms. The first
step was to find a symmetric function Q, of the elements a, 8, y, ... such that the
effect of every Hammond operator upon it is to leave it unchanged ; or, as I prefer to
say, to multiply it by unity. Q, is, in fact, the sum of unity and the whole of the
monomial symmetric functions S@?Aâ€™y* ... = (pgr ...). It is in the partition notation

a= 1+(1)-+(2)+(12)+(8)+(21)+(19) +... ad inf. It was then found that the effect of any Hammond operator upon any power of Q, is
merely to multiply it by a positive integer.
