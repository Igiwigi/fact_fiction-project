of the noise produced by the disengagement of the gas : still it was s0 clear that no
doubt could be entertained of its existence.

It may perhaps be thought that in the experiments I have just described, the
sounds are produced by the mechanical action of attraction or repulsion exerted
by the electro-magnet on the substance traversed by an interrupted current, and that,
consequently, magnetism has no more share in the phenomenon than a finger might
be supposed to have, when pressing on a sonorous cord. The simple description of
the experiments shows this interpretation to be inadmissible. In the first place, the
sound is the same with the wires in a helix, whether these wires be stretched or
not, or whether they be of lead, platinum, or brass. Besides, how could this account
for the sound produced in large masses, especially in liquids, such as mercury, and for
the fact, that the position of the conductor traversed by the interrupted current with
regard to the poles of the electro-magnet does not exert any influence on the pheno-
menon? Farther, it must be remarked that the sound in question is not a musical
sound, such as would be produced by a string or mass made to vibrate by a cause
acting exteriorly at its surface ; it is a series of s0unds corresponding exactly to the
alternations of the passage of the current ; like a species of collision of the particles
amongst themselves. Thus, the phenomenon is molecular ; and it leads to the de-
monstration of two important principles.

The first principle is, that the passage of the electric current modifies, even in solid
