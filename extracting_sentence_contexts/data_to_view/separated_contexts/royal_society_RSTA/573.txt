How can someone who has not walked on flooded lands,
compared the inundation between adjacent beaches, wondered why a single structure was left
standing while all others were flattened, debated whether a debris mark on a surviving tree was
from the tsunami or carried by the wind, and listened to sometimes widely different eyewitness
accounts for the same location, how can he interpret a historic report, or understand what real
difference a change in grid resolution can make, or ultimately put his flooding prediction in the
proper context. In our view, all energy and engineering companies prefer realistic answers and realize that
public safety is to the organizations’ best interest. Most are cognizant of the fact that an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Yet, sometimes, industry consultants, because of lack
of experience, imagine that their clients prefer the ‘good’ news of lower estimates, and do not
check and re-check and check again their analyses. Regulators are sometimes more comfortable
with people they know than people they don’t, ignoring the additional perspective that people
thinking outside their insular boxes can introduce.
