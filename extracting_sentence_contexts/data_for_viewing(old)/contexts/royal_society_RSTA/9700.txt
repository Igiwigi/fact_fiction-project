In the above the figures in brackets after the wave-numbers represent intensities ;
the wave-numbers in brackets are those of unobserved lines, put in partly to illustrate
the arrangement of satellites.

The lines 16107, 16119 (AX = 62066, 6201°9) would be in the region where the
photographic plates were insensitive ; in fact, the measured lines here are of intensity
4 at least, whereas \ = 6206°6 would certainly be less (by analogy), but 6201°9 (by
analogy) ought to have been seen if it existed, unless overshadowed by the very
strong line 16123 (A = 6200°3). 18510 would certainly be of small intensity, probably
less than those actually measured, but the convergence (3°34) and (1°75) of the two
satellites of the lines looks correct. If D,,(3) is correctly allotted and », = 882, there
must be a satellite D,, = 18107°66. Its distance from D,, = 50, which lies in order
with 12°31 and 3°34,

In the 8 14728 (A = 6787°86) is extrapolated. The next set (m= 4) appear to
show satellites. It may be noted that an alteration of 7 in S,(4) = 19923 brings
both », and », into order. The strong line 17846 has been used in the calculation.
Exyer and Hascuexk give 21490°22 in the are as a weak line and 19440°58 is extra-
