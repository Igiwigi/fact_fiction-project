This arrangement seems to be particularly called for in
cireles of large dimensions. The errors which may arise from lateral refraction have often been sus-
pected but never clearly ascertained. In the course of our work, however, we
had snch eyidence of the fact as to leave no doubt of its existence. The angle
between the same objects would differ under the most favourable circum-
stances about five seconds on different days, and perhaps a second and a half
or two 8econds may be considered as the error which may affect an angle
from lateral refraction in an ordinary state of the atmosphere. During the
obseryations at Stede Hill one fine day, the telescope being directed to the
staff at Wrotham, a shower rapidly approached from the left, and the staff
gradually receded from the cross wires until it was obscured by the inter-
vening haze.
