swallowed by a black hole’; etc.).

It is mostly biologists, particularly geneticists and neuroscientists, who make an explicit
distinction between Shannon or statistical information (bit number; novelty; probability of
occurrence—regardless of purpose or effect), algorithmic information (minimum number of
binary steps to define something; numerical values of physical variables) and pragmatic
information (representing purpose and effect) (e.g. [1]). Of these three classes of information,
the last one is most relevant for biology; indeed, the notion of quantity of information is often
of secondary importance: what counts is what information ultimately does, not how many bits : =
are involved.! 3

As L argue in Roederer [2], pragmatic information is a purely biological concept. This seems
difficult to accept for physicists—yet one must not forget the rather trivial fact that physics is nee)
the product of information processing by brains, based on interactions of systems chosen and :
prepared by brains, measured with artefacts (instruments) created by brains, using algorithms a]
(mathematics and models) developed by brains and following plans, purposes and quantitative DN
predictions made by brains. The principal obstacle in an effort to persuade physicists to accept the [o
idea of information being a purely biological concept seems to be the perceived lack of a widely [GF
accepted definition of pragmatic information that is truly objective, ie. unrelated to any human ,
use or practice.”

Rather than attempting to define information ab initio, it is more appropriate to start with

the concept of interaction between bodies as the primary concept or ‘epistemological primitive’
[2,4]. We can identify two distinct categories: (1) interactions which can always be reduced
