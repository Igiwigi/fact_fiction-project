into the character of the variations they represent, were we to overlook the still
more remarkable fact which they manifest, of a general, and with a single exception,
5; uninterrupted progressive increase in the amount of disturbance from a minimum
in 1843 to a maximum in 1848.

The interruption is in 1845, when the ratios, both of numbers and yalues, are less
than in 1844. This interruption of the perfect continuity of the progression occurs
alike at both stations; it is not of large amount, and is the sole exception to an
otherwise continuous increase in the amount of disturbance during the years com-
prebended in this investigation.

The accordance with which the ratios at Toronto and Hobarton indicate this pro-
* gression, is scarcely less remarkable than are the facts which they combine to indi-
cate. It is indeed difficult to regard results s0 strikingly correspondent in any other
light, than as independent and mutually corroborative measures of the same general
phenomenon; and to view the inconsiderable differences between the ratios of the
seyeral years at the two stations as due either to accidents of obseryation, or to the
want of strict simultaneity in all cases which has already been described. In snch
case a combination of the ratios obtained in opposite hemispheres would perhaps
present a not improbable approximate view of the general variation in the amount
of disturbance in the different years, occasioned in both hemispheres by the class
of phenomena under notice. It is contained in the following Table.
