The chain is enclosed in a proper cavity, hollowed out in the substance of the outer
tunic, and this sometimes opens externally opposite the free extremity of the chain,
Plate XV. fig. 9.

23. The feetuses do not form a chain by mere apposition ; they are all attached
by pairs to one side of a cylindrical double-walled tube, which is connected, at its
anterior or proximal extremity, with the system of sinuses of the parent, to the right
of the heart. The tube is in fact merely a diverticulum of the sinus system, Plate XV.
fig. 9, and the blood contained in the sinuses passes freely into it. It is divided by a
partition (x) into two canals, which are distinct for the whole length of the tube,
except at its very extremity, where they communicate just as the two scala of the
cochlea do; and it thence happens, that in the living animal, a constant current
passes upon one side of the partition and down on the other, the direction of the two
currents being generally, but not always, reversed with the reversal of the general
circulation. If the foetnses be traced back upon this tube, it will be found that towards the
proximal end of the tube they lose their distinctive form and become mere buds,
processes of its wall, Plate XV. fig. 9.
