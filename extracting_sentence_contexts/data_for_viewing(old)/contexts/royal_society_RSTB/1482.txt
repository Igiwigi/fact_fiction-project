‘The facts that I present are by no means new, but they seem to have quite

ly clue in the literature, which led me to Gununr’s ‘ Physikalisches Handworter-
wich,’ 1825, in which it is stated that PrrmstiEy discovered the solubility of CO, in
ve oil, and another investigator determined it quantitatively for linseed and
ender oils. The former takes up 1°5 vols. of CO, at 18°C., and the latter
vols., while water only dissolves 1:0 vol. I also found that twenty years after
Draper independently determined that CO, would pass through oils, and that
in his “ Treatise on the Forces which Produce the Organization of Plants,” published
ae York in 1844, he uttered the same protest, which I desire to revive and
extend, that “contrary to the apparent opinions of botanists, gases can pass through
