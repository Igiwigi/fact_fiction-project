This structure suggests that the chromosphere is in reality a region of innumerable
small eruptions of the same nature as the jets of highly luminous gas which are
constantly to be seen with the spectroscope in all regions of the sun’s limb. It is
probable, indeed, that these jets, and the larger eruptive prominences, are in reality
only the more pronounced manifestations of a phenomenon occurring on a smaller
scale everywhere over the solar surface. The highly-heated gases composing these eruptions, which may be supposed to
originate below the photospheric level, would lose heat as they ascended by adiabatic
expansion and by radiation, and at a certain elevation would precipitate the more
refractory substances as highly luminous clouds, forming, in fact, the photospheric
granules and the columnar filaments observed in sunspots. But the gaseous streams,
deprived of their condensable materials, would continue to ascend above the photo-
sphere, finally becoming diffused in the region of the chromosphere. The expanded
gases, subsequently subsiding in a relatively cooled condition, would form a strongly
absorbing atmosphere settling down uniformly and slowly upon the photosphere and
through which the ascending streams would be forced.
