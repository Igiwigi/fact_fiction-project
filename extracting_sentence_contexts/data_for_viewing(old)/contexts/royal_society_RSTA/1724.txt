projection is not necessary for the existence of the Stokes semigroup on L?(2) for 1 <p<ooasa
result by Bolkart et al. [14] shows. Hence, a characterization of those domains, even with smooth
boundaries, for which the solution of the Stokes equation is governed by an analytic semigroup
on LE (Q) for some p € (1, 00), remains a challenging open problem today.

We continue with results concerning the endpoints of the L?-scale, namely generation results
for L°(2) and L'(2) for various types of domains and consider furthermore the Stokes
semigroup on spaces of bounded mean oscillation. Note that results in these directions need
different approaches since the Helmholtz projection is no longer bounded in L®() and L1(@),
even for 2 =R". Nevertheless, it was shown in [15] that the Stokes operator, suitably defined,
generates a bounded analytic semigroup on L3°(R',). It is thus not surprising that the Stokes
operator defined on layers @ of the form 2 =R"-! x (0,1) generates also an analytic semigroup
on Co,¢(2) and ub (Q) for n=2. However, it is a very remarkable fact that the corresponding
results for n > 3 are false, see §3a and [16] for details. This means that the solution of the Stokes
equation in these cases is not governed by an analytic semigroup, implying again that a good
understanding of those domains 2 CR" for which the Stokes equation is well-posed now in
L1(Q) or L9(Q), respectively, is missing.

Abe & Giga [17] were able to prove via a contradiction argument that the Stokes operator,
suitably defined, generates an analytic semigroup To on Co,¢(@) and L3°(2) for a large class of
domains. A different approach to this question, based on the Masuda-Stewart method for elliptic
operators [18-20], was given by Abe et al. [21], hereby giving additional information on T>o, e.g. on
the angle of analyticity of Too; see also [22]. Let us emphasize here that the corresponding results
for L1 (2) are not known until today. Indeed, we formulate here the following open problem: Let
n> 2,2 CR" bea bounded domain with smooth boundary and Aj the Stokes operator, suitably
