mottled red and yellow-brown limestone. Nor do they show in Neumayr’s original figure.
Sectioning of two of the planulate specimens, however, has proved that in these the inner
and middle whorls are severely crushed and the middle whorls have been distorted to
adapt themselves to the flattened interior, with deceptive results (plate 33, figure 3).

Comparison of all available material has led to the belief that the inner whorls are
represented by the two specimens in plate 32, figure 3, and plate 33, figure 2.

Specimens not so crushed (plate 33, figure 4) show that at least the penultimate three-
quarter whorl is inflated and possessed of a nearly vertical umbilical wall with bullae on
the edge, as in P. robiginosus (p. 574). The beginning of the last whorl of Neumayr’s holo-
type, shown in his drawing as smooth and featureless, if undamaged would have had
a crater edge with bullae. The coiling and whorl development is, in fact, more like that of
Docidoceras cylindroides and some Bullatimorphites and Rugiferites of the Middle Bathonian
(cf. Arkell 1951-3, text-fig. 24).

The diameter of the holotype, 110 mm, is about normal. The two largest specimens in
the Playford Collection are 132 and 139 mm in diameter.

P. carlottensis Whiteaves sp. (1876, p. 38, p. vi) from British Columbia, has all the
essential characters of P. leicharti and is strikingly similar, but is larger and stouter. (See
below, p. 587.)
