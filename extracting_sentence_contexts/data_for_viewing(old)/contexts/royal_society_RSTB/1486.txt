after section of the nerves responsible for the supply of those ocular muscles which
turn the eyes to the left, for instance, the eyes may be somewhat inclined to the
right owing to the unantagonised tonus of the muscles which normally turn them in
this direction, and he found that by exciting the “ eye-area” of the right cerebral
hemisphere, normally responsible for turning the eyes to the left, such a movement

up to the middle line resulted. In view of the fact that the muscles responsible for
this movement were no longer connected with the central nervous system, the only
way in which such a movement of the globes could result was by a relaxation of the
intact muscles which tended to draw the eyes to the right before the cortex was excited.

Now it appeared to me that the larynx would prove a favourable field in which to
test this inhibition of muscles on cortical excitation. Accordingly, in animals the
adductor fibres of whose recurrent nerves had been previously severed, I applied
induced currents of varying strengths to the adductor centre in the precrucial gyrus,
and found that with strong currents the cords were arrested in the expiratory phase
of their excursions, but that there was no adduction beyond this point. To make
my meaning clear it is necessary for me to explain that when the adductor fibres are
divided in both recurrent nerves the cords, though abducted by the tonus of the
