Explicit symmetry breaking in potential surfaces. (a) A body (light blue ball) placed at the symmetrical peak of the :8
potential energy surface is not subjected to a net force due to symmetry. Its symmetry can be explicitly broken within a localized pra)
region of space, by displacing it towards the edge of the potential surface when it is under some finite force field which can :z
result in change in momentum. (b) The black ball in the figure in a potential well is under a net force due to explicit symmetry :

The fact that translational symmetry of the electric field is explicitly broken, resulting in the ;
generation of time varying magnetic field and radiation, is expressed by Maxwell’s equation

where E is electric field intensity and B is magnetic flux density. The above arguments also apply in the case of radiation from a dipole antenna connected to
a parallel two wire transmission line excited by a time varying voltage source (figure 3c). If the
parallel section of the transmission line is assumed to be infinitely long with an infinitesimally
small separation, the electric field has translational symmetry along the transmission line which
is broken along the flared end where rotational electric field is generated, resulting in radiation.
