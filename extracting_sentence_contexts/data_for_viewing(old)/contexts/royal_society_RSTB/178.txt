animal often fumbling about for a moment or two in the attempt to pick it up. More
conspicuous objects did not appear to offer the same difficulty, for the animal would
spring from the side of the cage on to a hanging rope with unerring precision.

Tn this case, in which we had removed both occipital lobes in previous operations,
and after the animal had recovered its visual perceptions so far as has just been
described, we subsequently cut away the cortex of the angular gyrus of one side. This
lesion was followed by a return of hemiopia, which remained permanent and apparently
complete until the death of the animal (from dysentery) four months later. This
is the only experiment we have made upon the angular gyrus. We have also
sometimes produced hemiopia in consequence of operations involving the under-
surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. These cases are probably to be explained by
the fact that the optic radiations into the occipital lobe have been reached by the

Movements of the eyes Munk appears inclined, but on very insufficient grounds, as it seems to us, to
connect with the angular gyrus. The ear-region he places around the extremity of the Synvian fissure.

It must be borne in mind that the plan which Munk has drawn up has been obtained chiefly, if not
entirely, by ablation, whereas ours is mainly the result of excitation. Unfortunately Munk has not
given the particulars of his experiments, but has merely stated their general tendency. In our opinion
their value would be greatly enhanced, were the precise symptoms manifested during life, and the exact
extent of the cortical lesion in each case, as determined by post-mortem investigation, recorded.
