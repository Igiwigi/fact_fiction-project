Existence of asymptotic velocities is a fundamental result in classical scattering theory, whose :8
proof is quite involved (see also [2, ch. 12.6]). As the o* are constants of the motion, they :<
present a weak form of integrability. In fact, in the non-empty open set of xo leading to a trivial : a
cluster partition (all ;*(xo) being different), 5+ is smooth if (1.2) is valid for all multi-indices : 2
Be nv. However, in the presence of non-trivial clusters, one would need more constants of {2

the motion or other asymptotic information [3,4] to have the so-called asymptotic completeness,
see [1].

For the unbounded potentials considered here, the question of classical asymptotic
completeness is even more involved. In the case of celestial mechanics, that is (in units where
the gravitational constant equals one), V;;(q) = —mjmj;/|\lq\|, there are collisions for n> 2, and : =
non-collision singularities for n > 4, see [5-7] and §2. Moreover, as shown in [8] for d=1 and 3
n=4 there are initial conditions which (after regularization of binary collisions) do not lead to :
singularities but for which limy—. +00 ||q(t, Xo) ||/t = 00, so that asymptotic velocity (1.3) does not nee)
