The power of this formula lies in the fact that once #
energy-function is expressed in terms of any measurements of the system that
convenient and sufficient for the purpose in view, the remainder of the investigatic
involves only the exact processes of mathematical analysis. It is to be observed tl
forces which can do no work by reason of constraints of the system tacitly assume
in this specification, but which nevertheless may exist, do not enter at all into #
analysis. Thus in the dynamics of an incompressible medium, the pressure in fl
medium will not appear in the equations, unless the absence of compression
explicitly recognised in the form of an equation of condition between co-ordina’
otherwise redundant, which is combined into the variation in LAGRANGE’s manné
in certain cases (e.g. magnetic reflexion of light, infra) we are in fact driven to #
explicit recognition of such a pressure in order that it may be possible to satisfy é
the necessary stress-conditions of the problem, while in other cases (e.g. ordin
reflexion of light) the pressure is not operative in the phenomena. There is als
class of cases at the other extreme—typified by a medium such as Lord Kany
labile eether which opposes no resistance to laminar compression,—where a ce!
co-ordinate does not enter into the energy-function because its alteration is |
opposed and so involves no work; in these cases there is solution of a const
which reduces by one the number of kinematic conditions to be satisfied.
