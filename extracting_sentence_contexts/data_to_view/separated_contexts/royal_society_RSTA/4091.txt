It is now natural to assume that g¢(0) is diagonal in the eigenbasis
of Hy, ie. [o¢(0), H¢] = 0 (this would be the case for a thermal state). Then we find

ate(t) = — z I, dsC(s){Up (#)'V,Ua(s) VU (t — s)Be(t) — Un(8)* Via (f)de(E)Uo(t — s)'ViUo(t — 5)

— Un(t — s)*VSUn(t — s)G0(t)Uo(t)* VU (t) + Ge(t)Uo(t — s)'V, Ua (s)* Vi Ud (t)}, (2.16)

with the real function C(s) = tr¢[U¢(s)* V¢Ug(s) Vio]. Going back to the Schrédinger picture, we
obtain

i 7
ihdpQe(t) = Hy ee(t) — @e(t)Ho — F(Velicel®) — Veoelt)Io — Traelt)Ve + eelt)IoVe}, (2.17)

where

In the simplest case, C(s) may be approximated by a delta function, such that 5, = Cp Vi/2, where
Co is the area under the function C(s), and the factor 1/2 comes from the fact that the integral goes
only over the positive half-axis. In this case, the master equation (2.17) is of Lindblad form with the
Hermitian Lindblad operator /CoV;. Note, however, that there are many interesting cases where
C(s) has a different functional behaviour, which then yields a rather unusual dissipation term.

(ii) Random matrix theory model

We use here the approach of constructing the average density matrix proposed in [14] rather
than calculating properties for each member of the ensemble and averaging these properties
afterwards.
