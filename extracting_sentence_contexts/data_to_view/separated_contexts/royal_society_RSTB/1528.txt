HEAPE ON THE MENSTRUATION

region seems to mark the line of rupture of the follicle, and, although one cannot say
when the rupture took place, there seems good reason to believe it is of recent occur-
rence. The fact that this specimen was found in an animal which was menstruating
at the time of death would doubtless, by many investigators, be considered sufficient
evidence of the age of the structure, and it would, by such, be unhesitatingly asserted
that in this case the follicle was ruptured during the act of menstruation then in
course of progress. It may be that this is the case, but I cannot admit that there is sufficient evidence
of that fact. Here we have under consideration seventeen specimens of menstruating
M. rhesus; in one of them, and in only one, a recently-discharged follicle is found ;
surely, then, very much stronger evidence must be adduced than is here obtainable
before one can justifiably assert, that the actual date of the rupture of this follicle is
in any way related to the act of menstruation going on at the time the specimen was
obtained. The second specimen is drawn in figs. 8 and 13, The animal from which this
specimen was obtained, was not menstruating when it was killed, neither was it with
young.
