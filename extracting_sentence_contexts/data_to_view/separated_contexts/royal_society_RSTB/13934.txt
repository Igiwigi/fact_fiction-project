However in
this case, the repository consists of GP models rather than
controller weights. Finally, we also remark that there is an increasing body of
work that uses novelty search [43] to jointly optimize body and
control. Although this is rarely cast as cultural evolution in
the literature, in fact it makes use of an external archive of
information that is updated over the generations based on
past experiences, and is used to guide evolution. Hence this
might be considered as cultural evolution in the sense
described above that individual evolution is guided by
experiences of other robots, and in that individuals have
access to information that does not exist in the current
population. The notion of novelty-search was first introduced by
Lehman & Stanley [43]: the idea is to replace objective-
driven evolution in which selection is driven by a perform-
ance (fitness) related quantity with a selection mechanism
that is driven instead by novelty.
