It is unnecessary to defend the adoption for gaseous indices of this expression,
which has been widely used for solids, and is in general outline established on theory

* The examination of NO» and N.O, has been postponed on account of its difficulty, but promises to be
no less interesting and important owing to the association which characterises it.

and confirmed by experiment. But it is desirable to emphasise the fact that the
calculation of the constants given in this paper from a formula containing only one
term on the right-hand side is only provisional, since the main conclusion of the
authors is that, both for elements and compounds, a single term is inadequate, except
in the case of monatomic gases. The simple form of the formula is, however, useful
for indicating at a glance the direction and magnitude of the changes in refractive
and dispersive power which take place when elements combine to form a compound.
