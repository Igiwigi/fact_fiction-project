in the case of the outer sheet, the differences here increase as we approach the neigh-
bourhood of the optic axes, reaching a maximum of 00044, line 15, Table XXVI.

After passing the optic axes, the differences decrease, and for the rest of Table XXV.
average about 00024, and in this case the curve given by experiment lies outside that
given by theory.

On examining the differences given in Table XXV. for the outer sheeb, I noticed that
theory and experiment agree closely up to the immediate neighbourhood of the optic
axis, line 16 ; while in the neighbourhood of the optic axis, Table XXVI., line 15, the
increase in the differences is much more gradual.

In fact, if we compare the experimental values of p, in Table XXV., lines 11-14,
and Table XXVI., 12-15, for about the same values of 0+0# we find considerable
differences.

This led me to calculate the results of other sets of experiments covering the same
ground, which had been already made.

The following table gives the results of one snch eb, taken about two months
previously ; during the interval the goniometer had been taken partially to pieces, and
afterwards refocussed and seb again.

It seems worth while to give the whole set of observations which cover nearly the
same ground as Table II., and form therefore a test of the degree of accuracy of the
