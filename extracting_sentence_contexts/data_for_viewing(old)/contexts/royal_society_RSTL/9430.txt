A consideration of these experimental facts leads to the following conelusions : (1)
that the effect is due to a redistribution of electricity in the conductor ; and (2) that
such effect is periodic. If a continuous electric state in the external body were the
necessary condition, the observed effect could be produced by charged non-conductors.
But as this is not the case, we musb look to the facility of change in electric state

afforded by conductors for an explanation of their effect, on the sensitive discharge,
This conelusion js supported by the fact previously stated that a small piece of tinfoil
placed upon the tube produces no effect s0 long as it is insulated. Such a piece of
tinfoil would give but little scope for redisbribution of electricityâ€”at all events, in
8uch a way as to affect the space around it. But if it be connected metallically with
a disLant conducting body, so that positive or negative electricity can be driven from
it to a sensible distance from the tube, the case is different ; and if this be done it is
at once found to affect the sensitive discharge.

If, then, the effect on the sensitive discharge is caused by the facility for a redis-
tribution of electricity within the portion of the electric field occupied by the conductor,
it follows that there must be a varying electric action upon ib from the discharge in the
tube. And that such is the case may be shown by connecting a ring of tinfoil placed
round the glass with the earth, and interposing a telephone in the circuit between the
