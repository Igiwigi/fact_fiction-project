part, and leaving a very small internal surface of the muscle exposed, that the differ-
ential current is found to be either null, or in the direction of the proper current. This fact attracted my attention in the course of my early experiments, but the ex-
planation of it is clearer to me since my later investigations, reflecting that in leaving
the thigh almost entire, we have two elements, that is to say, the muscles of the leg,
and those of the thigh, which direct the current in the same direction, while there
is but one element of the muscular current which gives a current in a contrary di-
rection. Returning to the snbject of this memoir, I would observe that I have employed a
muscular pile in the view of determining whether there is evolution of electricity in
the contraction of a muscle. But since in order to excite the contractions of the
musele, I was obliged to bathe it with concentrated saline or acid solutions, or better
with alkaline solutions, I previously studied the effects of the action of these liquids
upon the muscular current.
