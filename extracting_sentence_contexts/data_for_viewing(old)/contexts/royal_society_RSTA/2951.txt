by assuming that ‘the material of the shot have physico-mechanical properties substantially close
to those of the workpiece being clad’ and a granular bed was ‘practically incompressible’ [95]. It 74
was also argued in [95] that the effectiveness of granular beds made from iron shots is facilitated : w
by close values of acoustic impedances of the explosively cladded metal plates and acoustic 7S
impedance of iron shots. In fact an acoustic impedance of the granular bed, considered as a [3B
continuum, is much smaller than the acoustic impedance of the beads’ material—solid iron. In ,
case of zero precompression it is equal to zero (emphasized by the term sonic vacuum) or very

small at weak precompression as was explained above. The exact mechanism of the effectiveness

of granular beds and how to optimize their performance are still unclear, and are very interesting

and practically important subjects of research.

Granular beds incorporate one-dimensional elements—‘force’ chains. Nonlinear force
propagation into a granular bed caused by the striker’s impact was experimentally studied
in [96], and the results were explained using nonlinear grain-scale force relation similar to
