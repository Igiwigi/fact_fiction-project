Interestingly, the
uncertainty among the different factors in the Drake equation increases from left
o right. The ‘astronomical factors’ R,, f, and n. are rather well determined
as compared with the ‘biological factors’ fi and f,, while the ‘technological
factor’ f; and even more the ‘societal factor’ LZ are the great unknowns. Despite the fact that the Drake equation has been devised for SETI, only the
ast three factors are specific to intelligent life or its detection by means of
electromagnetic signals, whereas the others are relevant to any astrobiological
context.
