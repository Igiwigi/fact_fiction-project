and 75th percentile and the median is indicated by the grey line. Whiskers span +2.7 s.d. and data lying beyond are shown
as crosses. The black box indicates that apparently instantaneous onsets are more than 50% likely only for onset duration less
than 5 kyr. (Modified from Kirtland Turner et al. [25] fig. 6.) (b) Ratio of the mean ocean 5°C excursion size to the atmospheric
5®C excursion size as a function of the duration of carbon input of 14578 Pg C at —12%o (black squares), 6856 Pg C at —22%o
(dark grey circles) and 2275 Pg C at —60%o (light grey triangles). Dashed black line indicates the ratio calculated assuming a
—3.5%o mean ocean 5"C excursion after McCarren et al. [75] and a —4.6%o atmospheric 5°C excursion after Kozdon et al.
[76] and Diefendorf et a/. [77]. (Modified from Kirtland Turner & Ridgwell [30] fig. 4a).

the relative size of the CIE recorded between reservoirs [30], and (iii) on the synchronicity of
evidence for warming and the CIE [34]. Respectively, these methods concluded that the PETM
onset duration was less than 5 kyr, less than 3 kyr or greater than 4 kyr. In the following section, I
describe each of these three methods in greater detail and suggest that these apparently disparate
estimates for onset duration are, in fact, reconcilable.

4. Age-model independent methods for constraining Paleocene—Eocene
Thermal Maximum onset duration

(a) Method 1: lack of intermediate values in the carbon isotope excursion onset

Arguably the strongest evidence for a geologically instantaneous PETM onset comes from single
foraminifera records lacking intermediate or transitional d'3C values [28]. Kirtland Turner et al.
[25] suggested a constraint of less than 5 kyr for the PETM onset duration through application of
a sediment mixing model [74] to simulate an individual foraminifera record of the PETM CIE like
that generated from ODP Site 690 (figure 2a). Directly simulating the dynamics of the sedimentary
record through representation of bioturbation, individual ‘particles’, and changes in the relative
