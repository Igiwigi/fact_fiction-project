Thomas Young.

From that moment physiologists took sides: some were in favour of Young’s theory,
while others preferred Hering’s theory. It was not long before a fierce contest began, which
was destined to continue for many years; a contest which did much good, for it stimulated
research in the field of vision. Asa result, alternative theories began to make an appearance,
coupled with such famous names as Donders (1881), Ladd-Franklin (1893) and McDougall
(1901).

But, meanwhile, in 1893, a theory of a very different character made its first appearance,
at the hands of Wundt: ‘ When the retina is stimulated by a coloured light, two essentially
different processes are set into operation; one of these is colourless, while the other is
coloured, being in fact a function of the wave-length of the incident light. Thus, there is
a sensation corresponding to every part of the spectrum. Not three, or even four, primary
colours, but many.’ That is to say, what Wundt proposed was a polychromatic theory of
vision. Now followed a period in which new theories of colour vision appeared with almost
monotonous regularity.

Recently this spate of theories has abated, and workers have turned their attention to
research, rather than to invention. During this period the three-colour theory of Thomas
Young has played a most vital part; for first there was three-colour printing, then three-
colour photography, and lastly technicolour. Not only has Thomas Young’s theory played
an essential part in the growth of new methods of colour reproduction, but in precise colour
measurement as well. Also it provided a most valuable classification for the colour-blind.
So that, even if it should prove to be a fact that human vision is not trichromatic, and that
