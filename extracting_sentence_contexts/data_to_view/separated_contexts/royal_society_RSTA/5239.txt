This process was repeated several times, and
the cavity length was observed to change by (0.066 + 0.015) MHz. This gives a tilt sensitivity of
(—6.4 + 1.5) x 10-§ MHz g~! cm™!, in good agreement with the two-mass experiment value. Using the tilt sensitivity from the two-mass experiment, the fact that the total gravity signal
is 125.4MHz, and the moments based on the source mass position shift, we find a fractional
correction to our gravity signal of (—0.42 + 0.13) x 10-5 for the 12-14 May 2004 data and a
fractional correction of (—0.36 + 0.11) x 10-5 for the 3-6 June 2004 data. Tl. Temperature effects

The pressure drop experienced by the air feeding the source mass air bearings raises the concern
that resulting cooling could somehow influence the results, either through its effect on the
damping magnets or through some other unknown mechanism.
