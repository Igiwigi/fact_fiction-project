an the seab of energy, this work sending energy out into the medium, while an equal
Hnount of energy comes in in the rest of the circuit where it is moving with the E.M.T.
Fhis mode of regarding the relations of the various parts of the circuit is, I am aware,
Dry different from that usually given, but it seems to me to give us a better account
#& the known facts.

Z1t may 8eem at first 8ight that we ought to have new experimental indications of
is sort of movement of energy, if it really takes place. We should look for proofs at
ints where the energy is transformed into other modifications, that is, in conductors.

Vow in a conduetor, when the field is in a steady state, there is no electromotive
tensity, and therefore no motion and no transformation of energy. The energy

50x streams round the outside of the conductor, if in motion at all in its neighbour-
Dood. If the field is changing energy can pass into the conductor, as there may be
temporary E.M.I. set up within it, and there will be transformation. But we already
know the nature of this transformation, for it constitutes the induced current. Tndeed,
