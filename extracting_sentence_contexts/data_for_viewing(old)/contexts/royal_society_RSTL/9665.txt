fully made by means of a transparent scale applied to the film-side of the negatives,
reading to 4 a millimetre by division, and to half that quantity or less by estimation,
We attempted to take the measures with a micrometer, but the nature of some of the
absorptions precluded its use, since much magnification more or less shrouded the
phenomena ; with the solar spectrum where the absorptions are in more definite
lines as vpposed to bands, measurements with a high magnifying power are com-
paratively easy. The accuracy of our plan of measurement might be doubted, but it
is really trustworthy after a little experience. We should not have trusted to it, how-

ever, without referring some of the principal spectra to a comparison with the solar
gpectrum. The wave-lengths of the FRAUNHOFER lines in the infra-red region were
taken from the map furnished by one of us with the paper already referred to. A
test of the accuracy of the measurements was the fact that the same wave-lengths
of the absorption of any particular substance could always be obtained on several

photographs. we
We invariably compared all absortion spectra with that of ethy] iodide, which

furnishes almost entirely a line spectrum and, in fact, our meagurements were referred
to an empiric scale derived from the absorptions of this body, before we were
fortunate enough to obtain a wave-length scale from strict comparison with the golar
