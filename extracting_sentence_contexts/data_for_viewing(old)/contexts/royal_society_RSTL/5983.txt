. cords quite independent of those of the inner substance of the stem, while the successive
layers of the stems of Dicotyledons are ordinarily horizontal developments from the
cambium layers of the pre-existing bundles.

Many Dicotyledonous rhizomes, although perennial, form no distinct annual rings, and
it is common to find the older parts of these thinner than the younger ; the reverse of
what is ordinarily seen in trees of this class. But in those cases even where there are
10 annual rings, it is almost always possible to distinguish the typical arrangement of
the bundles of the yearling shoot in a single circle swrrounding the pith, with processes
of cellular tissxue forming medullary rays, running out between them to the rind or
bark. This circular arrangement is seen most distinctly when the stem has the inter-
nodes developed, but it is evident even when they are little elongated. The arrange-
ment of the fibro-yascular bundles in a single circle depends upon the fact, that the
leaves of Dicotyledons are supplied by a comparatively small number (3—5—T) of
fibro-vascular bundles which are developed collaterally, and in their course through the
few internodes which they traverse, remain side by side, separated by plates of cellular
tissue (medullary rays) which are interrupted at more or less distant intervals by colla-
teral anastomoses of the bundles. The bundles supplying the leaves are formed in the
bud, and their earliest vessels constitute the sheath of the central pith ; as the leaf is
carried out from the punctum vegetationis, no new bundles are developed, but the fibro-
vascular bundles are increased in diameter by the development of wood-cells and ducts
at their peripheral surface, and in most cases at the sides, thus encroaching on the
medullary rays.

In Monocotyledons it is usual to find the nascent leaf embracing with its base a
