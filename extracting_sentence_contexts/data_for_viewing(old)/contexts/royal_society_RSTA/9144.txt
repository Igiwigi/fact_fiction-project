radiation, we may express the fact in the following way :â€”The energy of a quantum
of K radiation is the energy required to move an electron from the position and
state of a K electron to the position and state of a lower frequency electron,
an Lelectron. (We are led to regard a K electron as being situated nearer to the
centre of the atom than the lower frequency electrons, and, in general, the frequency
of vibration of electrons to be in the order of their distance from the surface. Thus
the J, K, L, M electrons are arranged in this order from the centre outwards.)

But when a K electron is hurled out of the atom, it is possible that, for
stability, another electron will fall into the position and state of the K electron.
If it falls from the position and state of an L electron, the energy of a quantum
of K radiation must be re-emitted. The emission of a quantum of K radiation for
each electron expelled we have found to be an experimental fact.

Reasoning by analogy, we conclude that to displace an L electron necessitates the
absorption of the energy of one quantum of L radiation more than that required to
eject a still lower frequency electron. This energy is re-emitted as a quantum of
L radiation when an electron falls from the position and state of one of these lower
frequency electrons to the position and state of the displaced L electron.

Thus, on this hypothesis, the energy of primary radiation absorbed per K electron
emitted is h(n+nx+,+N+...), ae. the sum of the kinetic energy of the ejected
electron, which is hn, and the energy of one quantum of each of the characteristic
X-radiations of series K, L, M,.... Similarly, the energy absorbed per L electron
emitted is h(n+n,+y...), and so on.
