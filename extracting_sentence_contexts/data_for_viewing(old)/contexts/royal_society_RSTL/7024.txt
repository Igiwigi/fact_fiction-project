taking the total length of the cerebrum as 100, the part in front of the fissures of
RoL.anDo, the part between them and the perpendicular fissures, and the part behind
the latter, as seen from above, measure in the smaller or male brain 29, 42, and 29,
and in the larger or female brain 40, 35, and 25. The frontal region, in front of the
fissure of ROLANDO, as compared with the parts lying behind that fissure, is therefore in

the former as 29 to T1, and in the latter as 40 to 60. In both idiots the frontal region

is therefore defective, but unequally 8 in the two. It is scarcely possible to doubt that
dissection would establish the fact of a coincident want of development in the corpora
striata of these brains.

In both these idiots also the cerebellum is, comparatively to the cerebrum, enor-
mously developed. In the smaller brain, only one-third of it is coyered by the cere-
brum ; in the larger brain, the two parts reach back to exactly the same leyel; in both,
the laminz appear to be few, only twenty being distinguishable on the under surface of
one hemisphere in each.

The skull of the male idiot is thin, and appears to be much marked on its internal
surface with the convolutions ; that of the female idiot is thicker, and not 80 much marked
in that way.
