There was a marked variation in the percentages of the larvae which developed within
the cocoons of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis, when exposed to 2° C for short periods per-
mitting their subsequent development (table 11). This is possibly due to death of the resting
larvae, as these appear to be most adversely affected by this low temperature. The fact that
the percentage of ultimate pupation within the 3-day-old cocoons of X. cheopis was definitely
lower than within its 1- or 4-day-old cocoons supports this assumption, because the
proportion of the larvae ready for metamorphosis in the former case was higher than in the
latter. This is also borne out by the fact that a much higher percentage of mortality occurred
in the larval stage in 3-day-old cocoons of X. cheopis (table 12) than in its 4-day-old ones,
when exposed to 0° C for 1 day. In an experiment with X. brasiliensis at 2° C (table 11),
marked with an asterisk, seven prepupae contained fully formed teratological adults.
