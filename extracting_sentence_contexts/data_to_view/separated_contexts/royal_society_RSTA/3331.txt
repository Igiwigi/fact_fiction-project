For example, the energy-requiring processes which allow cell division have been
suggested to have been mediated by cyclic tidal processes [14], clays have been postulated to
have served as replicase-like catalysts for nucleic acid replication [15,16], various metalloenzymes
have been proposed to have been co-opted from environmental mineral catalysis [17] and mineral
cavities have been proposed as the precursors of cells [18]. The complexity inherent to the production of organic molecules is a logical starting point in
the search for prebiologically relevant processes. One should bear in mind, however, that the
components of modern biochemistry may in fact be the outcome of a considerable amount of
biochemical evolution, and not necessarily crucial for the origins of life [19,20]. Their centrality to
origins research may reflect a form of ‘survivorship bias’, and may therefore provide incomplete
guidance as a cohesive organizing principle. An environment-centric principle that encompasses
different forms of energy and chemical transformations may be a more suitable alternative.
