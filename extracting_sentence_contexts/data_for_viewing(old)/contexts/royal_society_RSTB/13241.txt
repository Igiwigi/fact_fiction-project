FrzE activity can switch cell motility from directional to oscil-
latory. We argue below that these properties are essential for
social transitions in the Myxococcus life cycle.

4. Are Myxococcus cells cognitive?

In her bacterial cognitive toolkit, Lyon proposed that bacteria
display a number of counterparts to well-known cognitive
processes [43]. In Myxococcus, sensory adaptation to environ-
mental changes is strongly suggested by the large genomic
repertoire of signalling systems [44]. It is not the focus of this
review to discuss how these systems interact with each other
to promote integrated responses; in fact, much of this knowl-
edge remains elusive. Here, discussing the details of the core
genetic system driving motility decisions, we wish to highlight
potential features that would be eligible as cognitive as
defined by Lyon [43]. A difficulty for this demonstration lies
in the unproven sensing capacity of the Frz system, given
that the actual biological signals remain unknown. Neverthe-
less, activation of the Frz receptor complex by extracellular

addition of an artificial signal (IAA) shows that it can be
sensory, although the exact relationship of nucleoid-bound
complexes with the extracellular milieu remains enigmatic.
