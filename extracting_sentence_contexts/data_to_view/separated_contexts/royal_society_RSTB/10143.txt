These complex realities in no
way eliminate the possibility of scientific inquiry. On the con-
trary, in some cases they result in simpler explanations than
those that are unduly constrained to be skull-bound, as we
witness in the case of escalation and perceptual crossing. Far from making social cognition fuzzier and mysterious,
the IBH in fact seeks to provide a more objective foundation,

one that is more amenable to scientific observation and
experimental manipulation.

My co-authors are correct in taking me to reject the possi-
bility, not just the plausibility, of the IHB in what I wrote in
§3. However, this depends on three concepts, whose relations
were argued for only in the vaguest terms; let me say a bit
more about them here in responding to the arguments of
§4.
