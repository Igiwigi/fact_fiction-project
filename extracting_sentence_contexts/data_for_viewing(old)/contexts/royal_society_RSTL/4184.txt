amounts, or attempting to produce an exact coincidence of the hypothetical and ap-
parent directions in any particular case. Nor did he pretend to assign the point
towards which the snn's motion is directed with any precision ; * it is 80mewhere near

In the same year (1783) in which Sir W. Herscnszr's paper appeared in the Trans-
actions; PrxEvosT communicated the results of a similar inquiry to the Berlin Aca-
demy in a memoir which was published in the Nouveaux M6moires of that Society
for 1781. PrevosT's investigation was also grounded on the proper motions given in
Maves's table. After stating the opinion of Mayer that the observed motions could
not be explained on the hypothesis of the motion of the solar system, he remarks,
that on examining tne table under every point of yiew, he had come to an opposite
conelusion, and found that it did in fact afford indications of snch a motion, although
the true motions of the stars, or, perhaps, some other cause, occasioned exceptions.
He then selects, from Maves's list, twenty-six stars whose variations of position ex-
ceeded 14” in right ascension or declination, and from a comparison of the whole
concludes that the apparent motions indicated by the table would be most nearly re-
presented by supposing the sun's motion to be directed towards that point of the
heavens of which the right ascension is 230?, and the declination 25 north, —a con-
clusion which agrees with that of Sir W, Herscnzr in respect of declination, but
differs from it about 27* in right ascension. The agreement of the individual obser-
vations with this result he considered was sufficient to render it probable, first, that
the solar system is actually moving towards the point indicated, and, secondly, that
at the present time the stars which are the nearest to the sun are Sirius, Procyon and
Arcturus ; and he thought the observations also afforded grounds for conjecturing
