pulse of 11s is emitted by the point source, and the set of impulse responses from this point to
the array of sensors (piezoelectric transducers) constituting the TRM is acquired. Note that those
responses are spread over more than 200 1s, i.e. 200 times the initial pulse duration. This is due to
the diffusive property of the multi-scattering medium. In such sample, the typical spreading time
(the so-called Thouless time) is equal to Tthouless = L?/D, where D is a diffusion coefficient related
to the mean free path and L is the thickness of the sample. Those responses are then flipped in time
and sent back by the TRM acting now as a source. It is then possible to scan the field produced
by this time-reversal focusing by translating the point source sensor parallel to the exit of the
multiple scattering media. An impressive time compression is observed, since the time-reversed
wave field at the focal point lasts about 11s compared with 200 1s. Besides, the typical spatial
dimension of the focus obtained through the scattering sample is an order of magnitude lower
than that measured in water (free space) as can be seen in figure 2b. This super-focusing result can
be explained by the fact that the diffusive medium acts as a lens. When the scattering medium
is inserted between the source and the focus, the waves emitted from the source diffuse. The
diffusive halo acts as an array of Huygens secondary sources at the exit of the complex medium,
along the interface that faces the focus. Now, since all those secondary sources have been phase-
matched by time-reversal (or phase conjugation) to focus at the desired location, this secondary
