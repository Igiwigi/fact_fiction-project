GASKELL ON THE CHROMAFFINE SYSTEM OF ANNELIDS.

muscles of the suckers at the anterior and posterior extremities are also paralysed. The dose required for an ordinary leech in order to obtain complete loss of movement
for purposes of operation is about 0-2 Â¢.c. of a 1-per-cent. solution, A dose of half
this amount causes complete relaxation but does not paralyse completely all reflexes. This dose is large in comparison with those required for vertebrates, in fact so large
that some observers, for instance SrravuB (41), have denied that curare has any effect
on invertebrates comparable to that in vertebrates. Straus, in his experiments on
the earthworm, hardly reached with his maximum dose the minimum dose required
to give any effect. Ihave made use of this action on the leech for the purpose of examining the
potency of a considerable number of samples of curare.
