percentage change in site-time yield comparing initial and final periods at 210°C. (d) Selectivities towards C;. (squares) and
CH, (diamonds) for all samples at all temperatures. The standard is black; filled symbols have 3% Mg; unfilled symbols have
6% Mg; blue symbols are calcined at 550°C and washed; red symbols are calcined at 550°C and unwashed; green symbols are
calcined at 800°C.

Hence, it is proposed that Mg ions have a poisoning effect on the intrinsic activity of Co metal
sites and the degree of poisoning depends on the concentration of Mg ions close to the Co sites.
The decrease in activity with increasing Mg incorporation into Co3O4 appears not to be simply
due to the total amount of Mg present in the sample, exemplified by the fact that AW6 has almost
twice the total amount of Mg as AW2 but approximately 150% of the activity at 210°C.

Poisoning by Ca has been observed previously with the reduction in activity being attributed
to electronic effects causing a decrease in surface hydrogen concentrations and increased CO
adsorption and dissociation [22]. Another study investigating the poisoning effect of alkali and
alkaline earth metals in the context of impurity elements in biomass-derived syngas implied that
Mg had a poisoning effect but that it was less than for Ca. The authors suggested that a physical
site-blocking effect could be the cause [23].

After approximately 65h at high temperature, the catalysts were returned to 210°C.
Interestingly, all the samples except the 0% Mg standard had higher activity after the high-
temperature run than before, as shown in table 3 by stability values more than 100%. This suggests
