the Oldroyd operator defined as in (6.4). Then, the following assertions hold true.

2 €0(By) & kA) := €o(Ay). (6.6)

(a) By generates a bounded analytic semigroup (er) 50 on LP (2) x WLP(Q)y" of angle g(a).

(b) 0 € o(By), but 0 ¢ op(By)

(c) The semigroup (e!8>) x0 is strongly stable, i.e. e!Br(u, rt)! > Oas t> oo for all (u,t) € Lh (Q) x
W1P(ayt.

Observe that the angle of analyticity represents well the mixed character of this equation. In
fact, if a is close to 0, then the angle of e'®r is close to 2/2 representing the parabolic character
of the fluid equation. If @ is close to 1, ie. strong coupling, then the angle of e'» is close to 0,
representing the hyperbolic character of the transport equation.

It is interesting to have a closer look at the spectrum o(Bp) of Bp.
