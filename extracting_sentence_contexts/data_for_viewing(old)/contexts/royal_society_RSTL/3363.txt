process, by which the disengagement of the light-created picture may be effected by
more simple means than at present.

(b.) If papers saturated with starch prior to being washed with the salt of silyer
and exposure to the sulphuretted hydrogen gas, the silyer being applied on one side
only, be, when completed, placed between the leaves of a printed book and subjected
to 8ome little pressure, the printing is faithfully copied off on the wnsilvered 8ide. It
is with difficulty the letters can be made out when the paper is taken from the yo-
lame, but by immersing it in a solution of iodine they become a deep blue, verging
on a black, whilst the ground remains of a yellow colour, which by the continued
action of the fluid changes to a light violet. On drying, the ground becomes con-
siderably darker, and the printing, though evident, indistinet, appearing in s0me posi-
tions the lightest, in others the darkest portions of the paper. These, and the facts
above-mentioned, render it probable that we may eventually succeed in copying
prints, &c. by mere juxtaposition.
