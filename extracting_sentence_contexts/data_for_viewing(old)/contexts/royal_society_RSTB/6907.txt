obvious) ; (6) the mouth of the lorica is circular in B. lacustris, but is extended beneath
the peristomial protoplasmic sheet to form a ‘peristomial flap’ in B. kepneri;
(7) B. lacustris has a definite cytostome and cytopyge while B. kepneri shows neither.
With regard to the last point it is not clear what Reynolds understands by a definite
cytostome, since he describes the ingestion of food particles at one point only, that is,
between the sheet of protoplasm and the base of the flagellum.

Reynolds observes that Biitschli’s account of B. lacustris only differs from B. kepneri
in that he does not describe the ‘peristomial flap’, and that he records a tendency to
form colonies. Of the differences between B. lacustris and B. kepneri only (6), in my
opinion, is worthy of serious consideration. According to Reynolds, Stein’s figures
suggest the relation between lorica and peristome described by him, but Stein ‘fails
to point out the fact that the protoplasmic sheet is actually attached to the extended
wall of the test. Indeed he shows it distinctly unattached in one of his drawings.’ This
is misleading. Stein does not suggest in his brief legend that the cup itself is drawn
out into a lip-like process, even though his drawing gives this impression. The process
is labelled peristome, in each case, as if it were a single, and not a double, structure.
Quite what the drawing to which Reynolds alludes is supposed to represent is not
clear, but even here Stein marks the reflected lip as the peristome, whereas Reynolds
would interpret it as part of the cup.

Unfortunately I did not see Reynolds’s paper until my supply of B. lacustris was
exhausted; certainly I never observed any one-sided extension of the cup and always
supposed that the continuation of the wall of the cup along the peristome in Stein’s
figure was due to an error. In view of the considerable distance between the retracted
