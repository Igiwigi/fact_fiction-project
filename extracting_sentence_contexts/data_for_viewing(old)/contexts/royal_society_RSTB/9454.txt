victims. These victims may be riddled by a multitude of
foreign bodies, e.g. glass shards, brickwork, timber, etc.,
besides bomb fragments. Although foreign bodies such as
brickwork or glass fragments may have killed the victim,
they are of minimal importance for bomb investigators,
who need to gather information on the type of bomb used
in order to try to find the perpetrators. With the HU values
determined by CT, possibly bomb-associated fragments, e.g.
fragments consisting of steel, aluminium, copper, etc., can
be located and extracted rapidly for further analysis [37].

(c) Adjuvant to autopsy
Several advantages arise due to the fact that forensic imaging
does not necessitate a physical contact or severing of tissue in

order to see findings. For example, in decomposing brains,
the anatomical structures, i.e. the skull and the cerebral cover-
ings, are left intact, so the cerebral tissues tend to keep their
anatomical relation to each other. This facilitates assessment
enormously compared with classical autopsy, where the
decomposing, liquefying brain oozes out as a papescent
mass after opening of the skull [38,39].

The fact that forensic imaging does not tamper with pre-
existing structures can also be of assistance when assessing
