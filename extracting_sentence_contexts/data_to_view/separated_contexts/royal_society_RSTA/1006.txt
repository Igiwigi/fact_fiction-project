It should be noted that fibrinogen molecules
are soluble before step (i) and contain some positively charged domains [46]. Therefore,
they can interact electrostatically with negatively charged particles. In fact, we previously
demonstrated that when magnetite nanoparticles with OHâ„¢ functionalization (MagP-OH
nanoparticles from now on) were dispersed in the blood plasma prior to polymerization, these
particles were homogeneously integrated within the resulting fibrin hydrogel, forming clusters
at the knots of the polymer network [28]. These clusters very likely acted as condensation
sites for the subsequent polymerization of the fibrin fibres, following steps (i)-(iii) described
above. For the preparation of the anisotropic magnetic fibrin hydrogels, we used as a magnetic phase
MagP-OH nanoparticles.
