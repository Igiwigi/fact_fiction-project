(1.4) in [28] and was later developed in [8,9,11-13,24]. The idea is to look for initial data that might
potentially lead to a finite-time singularity as a solution of a certain variational optimization
problem with the objective functional and constraints motivated by estimates (1.10)-(1.11). In
addition, in this framework, it is also possible to check (usually at the level of computational
evidence) the sharpness of a priori estimates such as (1.10). We say that a polynomial upper bound
of the type C€® for some a > 0 is sharp (up to a numerical prefactor) if the expression on the
left-hand side (LHS) of the estimate is O(E%) as € > oo. A family of initial conditions and the
corresponding flows parameterized by € and saturating a certain estimate in the above sense is
referred to as ‘extreme’. Energy-type estimates similar to (1.10)-(1.11) are also known for the one-
dimensional viscous Burgers equation and the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes system. While

these two systems are known to be globally well posed [3], the question whether these estimates : =
are sharp is in fact quite pertinent, because they are established using similar mathematical : =
techniques as (1.10)-(1.11). These estimates are obtained from the governing equations applying 1B
different functional inequalities and although each of these inequalities is known to be sharp, : =
sharpness need not be preserved if they are chained together (because different inequalities are DR
saturated by different fields). [3

These observations have motivated a research program focused on probing the sharpness :8
of a number of key estimates, both instantaneous as in (1.10) and finite-time as in (1.11), in the : Ss
one-dimensional Burgers and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes systems, in addition to examining :s
estimates (1.10)-(1.11) and more recently the Ladyzhenskaya—Prodi-—Serrin criterion (1.7) in three- 1h

dimensional Navier-Stokes flows. Progress in this research program was largely enabled by the
development of robust computational approaches for the solution of large-scale PDE-constrained
