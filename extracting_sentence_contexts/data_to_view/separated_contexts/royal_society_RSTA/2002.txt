This
approach allows a Boolean system to be translated into a continuous time system with parameters
that are representative of biochemical reactions [2]. Logical operators are used to represent
signalling interactions with ‘NOT’ representing inhibition, ‘OR’ a reaction in which the node can
be activated by multiple inputs, and ‘AND’ representing where the activation requires the activity
of more than one upstream node. The system of differential equations is formulated for each node y; in the network, i=1...64

reactions with respective weights for each node and subtracting the intersection of fj(y;) and fi(y1)
