Similar to magnetocaloric cooling, the feasibility of exploiting the electrocaloric effect has
been demonstrated first at cryogenic temperatures by Radebaugh eft al. [15,16], and later near
room temperature in several laboratory-scale devices by Sinyavsky & Brodyansky [17], Jia &
Ju [18], Gu et al. [19,20] and Wang et al. [21]. Finally, elastocaloric cooling is getting some serious
attention after Cui et al. [22,23] demonstrated a cooling device based on the principle suggested
by Annaorazov et al. [24]. Despite a number of successful demonstrations, all three near-room-
temperature caloric cooling technologies remain in their infancy, mostly due to the facts that (i)
the caloric effects that can be produced in readily available driving fields without damaging a
material are relatively weak, (ii) active regeneration is required to achieve the temperature span
of a typical vapour-compression device and (iii) caloric materialâ€”caloric cooling/heat pumping
device integration is, therefore, far from trivial. Over the last 20 or so years various aspects of caloric materials and caloric refrigeration/heat
pumping devices have been reviewed in a number of publications [25-41] and a few books [42,43]. Readers interested in details and the then-current state of the art are referred to all of these quality
publications.
