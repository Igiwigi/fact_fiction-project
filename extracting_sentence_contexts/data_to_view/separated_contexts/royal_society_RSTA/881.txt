Graph states form a strict subclass of stabilizer states, which are
described by simple undirected unweighted graphs. The vertices in the graph represent qubits
initialized in the state |+) = (1//2)(|0) + |1) and edges represent controlled phase gates between
the corresponding qubits. Any stabilizer state is in fact single-qubit Clifford equivalent to some
graph state [9]. Furthermore, a graph state that is single-qubit Clifford equivalent to a given
stabilizer state on n qubits can be found efficiently in time O(n>). Thus, if we find an efficient
algorithm that decides if some graph state |G;) can be reached from |G,) by LC + LPM + CC, we
also have an efficient algorithm for the more general case where the target and source states are
stabilizer states.
