in the local renormalization method each point is mentally split into two: the emitter and the
receiver. While emitter and receiver can change places in space, they cannot alter their order in
time: emission must precede reception. This subtle constraint from causality, combined with the
radiation of the cosmological horizon, creates [57] the cosmologically relevant divergence of the
vacuum energy in the second-order renormalization procedure established for planar media [47].
The Casimir energy may become cosmologically relevant. But does it explain dark energy?

4. The anomaly

The characteristic feature, equation (2.2), of the cosmological constant is the negative pressure p ,
equal in magnitude to the positive energy density ¢,. Is this ¢4 the renormalized energy density
vac of the quantum vacuum? No, because the corresponding pressure pyac must be éyac/3. This
is a consequence of the fact that the energy of an electromagnetic wave is equal to its momentum

times the speed of light. The energy of a volume element filled with incoherent radiation must : =
therefore be equal to the momentum transfer, i.e. the pressure, in the three directions of space, : =
which gives €yac = 3pvac- 18

So where does €, and pa come from? Consider the conservation of energy and momentum : -
as expressed in the second Friedmann equation (2.3). With pyac = &vac/3 one gets the differential : =
equation éyac = —4€yac With the solution éyac « n~*, This would imply that eyac is only a function [4
of the expansion factor n. Yet if &yac is a Casimir energy it must also depend on derivatives of n. : a
The vacuum energy évac violates energy-momentum conservation. Wald [60] understood the root : 3
of the problem: the lack of reciprocity in the renormalization procedure. Recall the point-splitting : S
