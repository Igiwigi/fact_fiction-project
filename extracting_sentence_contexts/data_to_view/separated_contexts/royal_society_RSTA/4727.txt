Thus for this case of a sphere the
mechanical forces exerted on the iron involve no distribution of forcive throughout its
volume, but simply an outward normal traction of intensity {(4? — 1) sin? @ — w+ 1}
H?/87 over its surface: that being so, the stresses agree with Kircanorr’s values,
and the elastic strain produced in the sphere is given by his formule,* the result of
course involving only very slight deformation. In fact, taking the axis of w along
the direction of I’, it is clear that an elastic displacement (u, v, w) of the type
u=au+ be (y+?) + cx, v= w= a's + Va (y? + @) + cx satisties the conditions
of the problem for the case of a sphere, the constants being determined by satisfying
the equations of internal equilibrium and adjusting the surface tractions. In addition
to this mechanical deformation there will be the intrinsic deformation above deter-
mined (§ 83) arising from the molecular changes produced by the magnetic polarization.
