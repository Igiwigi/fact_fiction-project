for, and though the task is a well-nigh hopeless one, the remains of them may yet
be found. In all probability most of them are filled with agglomerate, but some
may be represented by great bosses of crystalline rock like the Pitons of St. Lucia.

We searched carefully in the streams which descend from the main ridges, and
along the shores of the whole island for specimens of true plutonic rocks of dioritie
character, but none were found, and this helps to demonstrate the comparatively
recent nature of the whole island, and corroborates the evidence drawn from other
sources as regards its geological history.

It is, of course, possible to regard the island as an anticline or dome rising on the
summit of a great earth fold, such as is indicated by the soundings on the charts as
separating the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic. But there are certain facts to be
enumerated shortly which this would not explain, and in the whole island there is a

remarkable absence of folding, contortion, crushing and faulting. Small faults were
occasionally seen, but very rarely. None of the big masses of lava could be proved to
be cut by any considerable faults, and the irregularities in their outcrops were to be
explained by the variation in thickness due to outflow over a rough eroded country
rather than as a consequence of folding or deformation. In some of the other islands
evidence of faulting is far more abundant than in St. Vincent, though it may be
admitted that, except they cut the more persistent lava streams, it might be very
