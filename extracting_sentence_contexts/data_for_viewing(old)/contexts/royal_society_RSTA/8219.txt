discussion and results in a correction of 0-0033 gramme to be added to the loss of aleohol
observed. his correction is shown in the table.

The experiment of December 20, 1928, was carried out by Prof. LiypeMann’s method
where slow heating and cooling take place with the air current cut off. The positions
of the stopper were in this case known and a fairly correct H and © loss could be
caleulated. It will be seen that the second vessel loss, even when corrected, is still
large, and therefore there must be some other cause in operation.

A curious effect was noticed in the experiments at 30° C.; on “taking down”
there was always a marked orange colour to be seen in the H.SO, of the second branch
of the vessel which had received the alcohol vapour ; the first branch never showed more
than the merest trace of discoloration ; the fact that this occurs in the second branch
rules out the possibility that traces of rubber lubricant (this is used on the ground
joints) have been carried forward with the aleohol—it seems a proof that a change has
taken place in the reaction between EtOH and H,SO,.

The accepted results for p/p, are :—0-15233 at 12-95° C.; 0-15437 at 20-02°C. ;
0-15648 at 30-02° C., and 0-15645 at 30-06° C.

The two experiments of March 19, 1927, are not included as they could not be
corrected for the H and C loss.
