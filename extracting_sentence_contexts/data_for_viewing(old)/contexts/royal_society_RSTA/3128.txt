was shown in [3]. Furthermore, the stability behavior of these (unique) solutions is also well
known [4]; this is in fact one of the main classes of examples that was worked out within the
Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss formalism [4,5]. Concisely, these waves are spectrally /orbitally /linearly
stable for p € (1,1+4/n) and unstable for p € (1 + 4/n, p*) [6]. It is worth mentioning, however,
that the ground states conform to our set-up only in the case of n=2, as p there is the global
radial variable, whereas we are proposing here an ansatz with [1/2] pairs of radial variables.

We now turn to the problem at hand, namely the existence and stability of solutions to (1.4)
and (1.5). In the two-dimensional case, n = 2 and m = 0, these are the ground states, for which we
have a complete picture, including uniqueness and stability analysis. For the case n = 2,m #0, the


existence of the solutions of (1.3) is also well studied. In the work [7], the authors have provided
a detailed study of the elliptic problem (1.3)—in particular, they proved the existence of smooth
