However, it cannot be excluded that the discre-
pancy between these findings results from the complex
mode of action of the non-competitive GluN2B antagonists
used, as the extent of their block varies with agonist concen-
tration [57], and such concentrations are likely more variable
when glutamate uptake is blocked. Overall, therefore, the
