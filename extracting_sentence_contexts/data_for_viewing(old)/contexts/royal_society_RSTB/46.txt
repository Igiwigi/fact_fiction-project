Of the other Mammalian orders all fall easily enough into their places in this
scheme,* with two exceptions, namely the Cetacea and Edentata, As regards the
first, the general drift of the evidence seems to be that their ancestors have passed
through a stage with a more or less complete milk dentition, which has gradually been
again aborted,t its place being taken in the Odontocetes by the large and quasi-
vegetative increase in the number of the molars, and in the Mystacocetes by the
baleen, which latter has so fulfilled all the requirements of the animal that the “ per-
manent ” or original dentition has also been reduced to the position of a useless atavism,
shed or absorbed before birth, and not playing any functional part in the life of the
animal.

In the Edentata, on the other hand, we find, as is well known, characteristics wholly
at variance with those cf all other Mammals. In fact, a study of the teeth of this
