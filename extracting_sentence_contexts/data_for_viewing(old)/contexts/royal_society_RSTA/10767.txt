ality is decidedly more marked than for the latter.

A reference to the table will show that these rays give results much closer to the
deflectable rays than to the Réntgen rays. The very large conductivities charac-
teristic of compounds of sulphur and the halogens under Rintgen rays are not met
with in the case of Becquerel rays of any kind.

It is now very generally agreed that the deflectable Becquerel rays consist of a
stream of negative ions proceeding from the radio-active body with enormous
velocities (BEcQUEREL, ‘Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 130, p. 109). But this theory gives
no account of the nature of the other variety of Becquerel rays. I wish to make
some mention of a possible solution of the question, indicating how far it appears to
fall into line with the known facts.

Let us, then, imagine that the absorbable rays consist of a stream of positive ions
moving from the radio-active body.

Now we know that the positive ions in gases carry the same charge as the
negative, and that they have an enormously greater mass (J. J. Tomson, ‘ Phil.
Mag.,’ vol. 48, p. 547). Unless, therefore, their velocity is smaller out of all
proportion than the negative ions, it is to be expected that they will be much less
easily deflected by the magnet. This theory indicates, then, that by applying a very
powerful field, the “soft” rays would be deflected. It would be well worth while to
experiment in this direction.
