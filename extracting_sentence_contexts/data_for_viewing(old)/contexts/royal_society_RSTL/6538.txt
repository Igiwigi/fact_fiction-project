® An aqueous 80lution of sulphurous acid cuts off the spectrum at the same point as the gas itself does.

21. The most interesting fact, however, disclosed by these various experiments is the
persistence of either the diactinic or the absorbent property in the compound, whatever
be its physical state—a circumstance which proves that the property under consideration
is intimately connected with the atomic or chemical nature of the body, and not merely
with its state of aggregation.

The following diagram represents approximatively the relative position of the portions
of the spectrum transmitted in a few of the cases described in the foregoing section of
this paper. No attempt is made to indicate partial absorption of the rays. In one or
two instances, where complete absorption at a particular part of the spectrum occurs, this
has been indicated by an interruption in the line.
