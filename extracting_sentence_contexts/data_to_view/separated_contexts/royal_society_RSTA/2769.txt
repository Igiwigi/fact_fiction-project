Across their full lateral dimensions, plate interiors do not experience significant levels
of deformation. The lack of deformation is what defines ‘rigid’ plate interiors and allows Euler’s
theorem for rigid body rotations on a sphere to be applied to the relative motion of plates [7,8]. The fact that a mathematical theorem sits at its core highlights the precision associated with plate 4 |
tectonics theory (it is no accident that plate tectonics was also referred to as tectonics on a sphere

during its development). It is that precision that makes the theory testable. It also distinguishes 2
plate tectonics from other potential tectonic modes. 8

The creation and maintenance of a global network of narrow plate boundaries is a critical is
condition for plate tectonics.
