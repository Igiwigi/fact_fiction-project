The constants Q and A are to be determined from the condition that the applied
load is

w= — | rb dre, (7)*
and has a moment about the origin given by

fas [[-@2-2.70) drdz.
We observe that in virtue of (18)
46=0 and YW —=—2(Q—Az) (20)

when stands for the quantity within curly brackets in the last of (19) ; also that when
the boundary is symmetrical about the axis Or (as will be the fact in most problems
having practical interest) solutions in which both of ¢ and are respectively even and
odd in z correspond with the independent constants Q and A. Then (for symmetrical
loading) the Q-solution contributes to W but not to N, the 4-solution to N but not to W.

Section II. NumericAn sOLUTIONS BY THE RELAXATION METHOD

11. We now seek, for some particular shapes of boundary, numerical solutions of
the problems formally solved in §§3-10. Except in one instance (§23) we shall assume through-
out that o has the value 0-3. Our technique will be that developed in earlier papers of
