This is the condition necessary for its most rapid oxidation. We should
= expect, therefore, to find in the explosions of hydrocarbons that the retarding action
3 of large quantities of oxygen is partly counteracted by this secondary reaction, for the
E oxygen in presence of the steam is not inert towards the carbonic oxide. Asa matter

of fact, we find that the first additions of oxygen to the hydrocarbon mixtures retard
A more than nitrogen, but as the additions are continued the oxygen has less and less
retarding influence compared with the nitrogen. When carbonic oxide, which has the same density as nitrogen, is added to
electrolytic gas, the retarding effect on the explosion is very nearly the same as when
an equal volume of nitrogen is added :—

* The greenish-grey tint, observable in the outer flame, may be due to some oxide of nitrogen formed
in the inner flame. A little peroxide of nitrogen gives a similar tint to an ordinary Bunsen gas flame ;
and peroxide of nitrogen is formed when cyanogen is burnt under certain conditions (vide ‘Chem.
