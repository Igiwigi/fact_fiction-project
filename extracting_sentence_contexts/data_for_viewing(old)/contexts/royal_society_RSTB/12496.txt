Returning to the question of power posing (§5b), in 2017 a similar discussion among researchers in human chemical
special issue of Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology communication, in a journal such as Chemical Senses?


(b) What do we really know? Re-assessing our existing
literature

Identifying these realities— that researchers engage in p-hacking

and that p-hacking makes it trivially easy to accumulate signifi-

cant evidence for a false hypothesis—opened psychologists’
eyes to the fact that many published findings, and even whole

literatures, could be false positive. Nelson et al. [4, p. 513]
Sadly, we cannot assume that the conclusions of papers that
we traditionally cite about different aspects of human chemical
communication are reliable. We need to be more careful with
what we cite in our introductions and discussions. When I
have been assessing papers for inclusion in my own literature
reviews, though I check for controls and whether the study
was done blind, I tend to assume that the peer review system
has worked. As mentioned earlier, high impact journals may
be no more reliable than lower-ranked ones [49], and work
published there certainly can be fallible, as Camerer et al. [50]
