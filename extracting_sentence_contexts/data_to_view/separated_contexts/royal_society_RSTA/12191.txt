H. differs but little in any respect from the
normal, and this tends to show that the persistency is far greater in the blue sensation
than in the green, in other words, that the green part of the spectrum excites the
blue sensation in the normal eye after the light has been so much reduced that the
green sensation has ceased to be excited. V. H. is the first case in which the total
absence of a green sensation is an established fact, and the probable luminosity of
such green sensation is derived by subtracting the ordinates of his curve from those of
the curve of the normal eye. That H. R. is not totally red blind, we have on several
occasions had the opportunity of proving.
