When we use the conditions (2:18) to solve for the constants A, we obtain the following
solution for ,:

The above solution, derived by the exact method, possesses two disadvantages: the nature
of the variation of 17(é) with € is relatively obscure, and the corresponding solutions in
later developments of this theory cannot be obtained in this way. Therefore before pro-
ceeding to a discussion of the solution (2-21) it is of more importance to establish an approxi-
mate method which will not only clarify the nature of the 1,(¢) but will also be applicable
to later problems. One of the important features of the experiment is the fact that the fluid depth is small
compared with the radius of the dishpan, and the method we introduce makes use of this
feature. It will be noted from (2-7) that if we are to satisfy the side condition

t=v=0, r=7), (2°22)
it is necessary that we choose / so that
J,(fr) = 0. (223)

This will define an infinite set of f’s which we shall denote by f, (s = 1, 2,3, .--). For the
present we confine our attention to the first zero of J, which gives

Pitor=oe0e

Hence the parameter a defined in (2-17) will in this case have the value a = 0:6.
