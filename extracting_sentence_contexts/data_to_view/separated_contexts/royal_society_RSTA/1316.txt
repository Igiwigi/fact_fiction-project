multiple areas (e.g. different countries in the European interconnected system) while the grid
becomes increasingly low-carbon. In fact, with more and more renewables in the system, the
associated variability and forecast uncertainty create more challenges in terms of how power
flows across different areas under the jurisdiction of different transmission system operators
(TSOs). These flows need to be managed to preserve system security. The paper argues that,
in order to fully exploit the value of existing grid flexibility to economically support security
management across several interconnected areas, multi-TSO coordination could be achieved by
adopting a new approach inspired by the principles of cooperative game theory.
