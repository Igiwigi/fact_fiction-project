O, O’ say ; and, in fact, to directions through O in II there will correspond points of
a double line 4 of V—all those directions which lie in a plane through O, O’ going into
the same point of 4. For to any line through a certain point P of 4 there corresponds
the curve of intersection of three quadrics which touch the plane through O O’ corre-
sponding to P ; and since this curve has a double point at O and meets II twice there,
it follows that every point of 4 is a double point of V. Thus every Y-primal, in any of
the transformations {2, 4 (2), n}, has a double line.

Locus of Double Line.—Now it requires one condition to make a ®-quadric touch a
given prime through the plane = at a given point of the line 1; and we may say, then,
that to all points of the section by a prime through = of the neighbourhood of any point
of 1, there corresponds one point of 2. For transformations of class I of the table the
’ locus of such points of = is a quadric surface Q, as appears from the fact that any two
-quadrics touch each other at two variable points of |; and it is easy to see that to
generators of one system of Q there correspond neighbourhoods of points of 1, and to those of
the other system there corresponds sections of the whole neighbourhood of the line | by primes
through x. For transformations of class Il, however, we get, instead of Q and its two
systems of generators, only a plane c and two pencils of lines in this plane ; and for
those of class III, we get only a line 4 which then corresponds to the whole neighbourhood
ofl. Also if any prime of S meet / in a point O, the corresponding ‘’-primal will have
for its double line ‘the line corresponding to the neighbourhood of O. Hence, for
transformations of class I, the variable nodal-line of ‘Y-primals describes a quadrie
surface Q; for those of class II, it describes a pencil in a fixed plane o; and for
those of class III ¥-primals will have a fixed nodal line. We know, then, by Brrrinr's
theorem* and it is also clear otherwise that the surfaces Q and « must be base
