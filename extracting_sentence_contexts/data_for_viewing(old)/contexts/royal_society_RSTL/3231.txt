(34); the feet were shifted until the arrangement gave a clear sound, and
the moistened brass filings sprinkled upon the plate formed regular lines or
figures. These lines were not however lines of rest, as they would have been
in the air, but were the places of greatest vibration ; as was abundantly evi-
dent from their being distant from that nodal line determined and indicated
by the contact of the feet, and also from the violent agitation of the filings.

In fact, the filings proceeded from the quiescent to the moving parts, and there
were gathered together ; not only forming the cloud of particles over the places
of intense vibration, but also settling down; when the vibrations were weaker,
into the same involving groups, and in eyery respect imitating the action of
light powders in air. Sand was affected exactly in the same manner ; and
even grains of platina could be in this way collected by the currents formed in
s0 dense a medium as water.

39. The experiments were then made under water with the membranes
stretehed over funnels (22) and thrown into vibration by horse-hairs drawn
between the fingers. 'The space beneath the membrane could be retained,
filled with air, whilst the upper surface was covered two or three inches deep
with water; or the space below could also be filled with water, or the-force
