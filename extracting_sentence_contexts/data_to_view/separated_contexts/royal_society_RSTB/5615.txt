Table ITI, p. 60, are all of the same type and are chiefly remarkable for the fact that
each of the three strains tried gives rise to very considerable amounts of carbon in the
sulphuric acid bubbler, indicating the production in fair amount by this species of
some relatively volatile material. In addition, considerable amounts of “ carbon in
volatile neutral compounds ” are produced, varying from about 20 per cent. with Ad.
52 to 30 per cent.
