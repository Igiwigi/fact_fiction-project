above that
of the atmosphere, but its rate of pulsation was only thirty-two beats per minute. I should have attributed this
low rate of pulsation to the specimen having been 80 long remoyed from the nest, had not the rate of pulsation in
this larva been examined by my friend Mr. OzxsBorx a few days before, and almost immediately after the
specimen was obtained from its nest, and found at that time not to exceed thirty-three or thirty-four beats per
minute. These facts therefore are in accordance with the observations on the larya of Anthophora retusa and
Bombus terrestris, and also accord with other observations on the laryz of that very destructive tenthredo or
aw fly Athalia centifolia, KLuc ; which has been 80 obnoxious to the agriculturist by destroying his crops of
turnips during the last three xummers. London, November 7th, 1837. TABLE.â€”TEMPERATURE OF LARVE.
