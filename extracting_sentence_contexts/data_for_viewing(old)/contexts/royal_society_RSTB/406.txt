(1) Both Eyes move conjugately to the opposite side.—The representation of this
movement we found to extend in front of the precentral sulcus, z.e., to a slight extent
just in front of its vertical limb, but lying principally in advance of the sulcus w.

The focus of the area is situated in the centre of the gyrus, at the points marked 2,
2, 2, in fig. 3. The whole representation extends as indicated by the stippling in
fig. 1, Plate 18. The movement was also elicited from the centre of the gyrus, as
above stated, at squares 3, 4, 5, 6 (fig. 3), but it was very slight, and at the angle
formed by the two limbs of the sulcus there was no excitable point.

As compared to the same movement obtained from the Bonnet Monkey, Macacus
sinicus (see ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1888), this result from the Orang was characterised as
being much slower in development and execution—in fact, resembling rather the
movement* obtained from the angular gyrus in the Bonnet (vide Professor ScHAFER,
‘Roy. Soe. Proe.,’ and confirmed by ourselves).

As indicated in the title of this section, no other movement was observed than that
of both eyeballs to the opposite side, unaccompanied by the commonly-associated
actions of opening the eyelids, dilatation of pupils, and turning of the head.

(2) Combined Movement of Eyelids opening briskly, Eyeballs turning to the opposite
side, and Head turning to the opposite side.—This association of movements was
obtained at squares 24, 25, 26, 27, 111, 112, 118, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, and
appeared to be equably represented over the (dotted) area (see fig. 2, Plate 18), which
is seen to be situated in the ascending frontal convolution. The sequence was that
