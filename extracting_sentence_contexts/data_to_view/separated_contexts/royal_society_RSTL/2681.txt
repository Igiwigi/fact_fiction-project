SUCH is the general outline of the vital and sensitive systems ; and the manner
in which the various powers of the living animal are related in the formation of these
systems. By the foregoing means, the nervous power maintains the vital functions
properly 80 called ; and the sensorial power is brought to cooperate with the powers
of inanimate nature, powers which have no properties in common. IT appears from the facts adduced in my paper on the Nature of Death, published
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1834, that the vital and sensitive systems obey
very different laws, the difference depending on the vast difference in the nature of
the sensorial and nervous powers, the leading powers which pervade all their depart-
ments, and to which all their other powers are subservient. These other powers, it appears from what has been said, are the same in both,
namely, the muscular power and the powers of the living blood, and, in the sensitive
system, the nervous power itself; for in this system all the other powers of the living
animal are directly subjected to the sensorial power, while none of the powers of
the vital system have any direct influence on it, their influence on the sensorial
power being through the medium of its organs, the structure and wellbeing of
which immediately depend on the vital powers. In other respects also the laws of the two systems essentially differ.
