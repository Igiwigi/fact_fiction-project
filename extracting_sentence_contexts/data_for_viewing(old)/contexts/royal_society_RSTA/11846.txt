These deposits are made up entirely of fragments of the rocks found in situ.
The fragments are sometimes all angular or sub-angular ; but well-rounded water-
worn pebbles are by no means unfrequent in them. The fine materials of the earths
consist of scales of kaolinite, mica, &c., stained to a yellowish-brown tint by
ochreaceous material. J. W. J.

VIT. Mryeraroey.

In studying the series of minerals obtained from the interesting corundiferous
localities of Burma, there are three classes of facts which appear to bave a special
significance and to be worthy of study for their important scientific bearings.

First. The association of the various species of minerals in the rocks of Burma,
which contain the rubies and other gems; and the comparison of this association
with the facts observed in other areas, where the same gems occur. This study
of paragenesis constitutes a line of enquiry of great promise to the mineralogist.

Secondly. This association of minerals in particular rocks of different areas is
suggestive of the conditions under which the Burma gems—the corundum (ruby),
spinel aud tourmaline (rubellite)—may have been formed, and the chemical reactions
to which they owe their origin.
