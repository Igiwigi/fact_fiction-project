To the theory con-
necting them with the anaphylactic reaction of the guinea-pig to a soluble antigen,
this seems to be definitely fatal. On that theory the specific antigen should exhibit
its action on the tissue cells of the anaphylactic animal only in the presence of blood,
while the anaphylatoxins should act directly and in its absence. The facts are the
direct converse of this expectation. While these considerations appear to us to make it impossible to give any general
significance to the anaphylatoxins in the explanation of anaphylaxis, we are not
concerned to deny that their effects may furnish analogies for some of the hetero-
geneous assemblage of phenomena to which this name has been applied. If the term
is to be allowed to cover any of the shock-like phenomena which may result from the
sudden formation of precipitates or agglutination of corpuscles in the circulating blood,
there will obviously be many points of possible analogy between some of the
phenomena called “anaphylactic” and the action of the “ anaphylatoxins.” In our
own view this extension and vagueness of nomenclature is regrettable, as being
