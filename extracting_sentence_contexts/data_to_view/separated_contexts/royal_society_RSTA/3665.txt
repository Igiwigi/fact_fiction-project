Further than this, it was always noticed that diselectrification occurred when the
magnetic field was suddenly destroyed rather than when it was created. A particular
rarefaction was found for each bulb, such that the band A could be electrified, and,
irrespective of the fact that the electrodes were magnetised, retain its charge. Jn all
such cases the effect of rapidly destroying the magnetic field was to produce diselectri-
Jication, whereas when the current supplied to the magnet coils was broken under water,
and in consequence the magnetic field caused to gradually diminish in strength, no trace
of diselectrification was observed. It was therefore clear that variations in the
