There is no hint of a sneaking through mechanism in our model. According to the definition
given by Gatenby et al. [20], sneaking through is the preferential take of tumours after small size
inocula to a similar degree to that seen with large size inocula, compared with the rejection of
medium sized inocula. More clearly put, small and big tumours escape immune surveillance,
while intermediate ones do not. Such phenomenon has not been observed in the present case for
other values of the tumour size at detection. However, we do not discard it, because motility of
tumour cells has not been included in this first investigation, and might be crucial for these cells
to escape.

Finally, even though the tumours here inspected are genetically homogeneous and no
evolutionary process is really taking place in our model, the transient bifurcation diagrams
insinuate how the sculpting of the phenotype occurs, moving from the first region to the second,
and then to the third. In fact, a similar CA can be used to explore the impact of heterogeneity
and how the process of immunoedition takes place. It suffices to consider that the immune cell
intrinsic cytotoxicity, represented by the parameter 6y,, depends on the tumour cell.

(b) Low recruitment scenario

We now evaluate the impact of the recruitment of immune cells to the domain of the tumour.
For this purpose, we reduce the value of @;eÂ¢ from 1 to 0.35. Our interest in this parameter is
due to the fact that, on many occasions, the recruitment of cells to the site of the tumour might
be very complicated. The recruitment of immune cells is a very complex process, at least from a
physical point of view. The extravasation of leucocytes requires an initial contact between these
