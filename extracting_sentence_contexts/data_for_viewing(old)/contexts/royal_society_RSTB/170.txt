recognised performs, as has been already stated, a function similar to complete
insulation. Each column conducts its own homodromous current comparatively
well, but bars the passage to the heterodromous current threads of all the other
columns ; and, as this is the same for all the columns, the heterodromous current threads
are forced to take the circuitous route round the edges of the organ, just as if the

organ consisted of a non-conducting substance” (19),

Besides these two important facts the work of pu Bors-ReyMonp brings into
notice the presence of an organ-current in the quiescent tissue (20). This organ-
current is a feeble counterpart, as far as its direction and distribution are concerned,
of the electromotive changes which are present during the state of activity. The
existence of this current is a matter of very great interest in relation to the well-
known diversity of opinion as to the so-called “ demarcation ” currents and “ currents
of rest” present in muscle and nerve.

There are thus three distinct aspects under which the electrical organ of the
Torpedo has been and may be studied.

I. As an inactive organ with reference to the effect produced upon it by the
operation of such agents as galvanic currents, mechanical injury, temperature, &c.
