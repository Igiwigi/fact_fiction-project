In the higher plants oil has not yet been proved to be a direct product of carbon
dioxide assimilation.*

On the contrary, WAKKER states that the oil in the chlorophyll bodies of
Monocotyledons which form no starch is not a product of assimilation, but rather
indicates the beginning of degeneration. He also notes that the oil was chiefly
found in plants grown in greenhouses. This statement is interesting in connection
with the fact that all the outgrowths developed during the present experiments
were formed in plants grown under glass. The formation of the oil in the outgrowths appears to be closely connected with
respvration. In certain other cases the production of oil is known to be due to
imperfect respiration.
