droughts. This is supported by the small influence that would be expected by precipitation given
the few changes observed in SPI (ยง2). Moreover, the global increase in AED would not explain
the spatial patterns of changes in hydrological droughts worldwide. Thus, the increased AED
has been so homogeneous globally in the last few decades (figure 3), that if we were to support


a dominant role of AED, an increase in the frequency and severity of hydrological droughts
should be observed in more regions, particularly in those that do not show positive precipitation
trends and in general, in all semi-arid regions in which the average river flows are low in
magnitude and the AED very high. On the contrary, the increase in hydrological droughts has
been primarily observed in regions with high water demand and land cover change (e.g. western
North America, the Mediterranean, north-eastern Brazil and southern Australia), supporting the
fact that the role of the AED increase in hydrological drought trends is small in comparison with
other human-induced influences in these regions.

(a) Analysis of drought scenarios in response to enhanced C0) emissions
from CMIP6 models

The outputs of the CMIP6 experiments have recently been released, and different studies
have already analysed the huge amount of data they generated to characterize drought
changes in future climate scenarios. Regardless of the drought metric used, there is agreement
that high emission scenarios of greenhouse gases will further increase the frequency and
severity of meteorological, agricultural and ecological and hydrological droughts than low
