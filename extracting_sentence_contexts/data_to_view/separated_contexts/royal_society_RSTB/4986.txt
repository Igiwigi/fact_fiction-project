Thus attached from both edges these then
become converted into narrow rods. This analysis presupposes that the shoulder girdle lies some way behind the skull. This is in fact the case in all Embolomeri, but in later Labyrinthodonts, and the early
reptiles, the shoulder girdle moves up to the head, presumably to decrease the load
carried by the fore limbs. Such situation must have entirely prevented lateral
movements of the head. Another change of importance found in the secondarily aquatic Labyrinthodonts is
an immense widening of the lower ends of the clavicles, the mechanical meaning of this
arrangement is obscure, but it is clearly a condition following on the terrestrial type
just described.
