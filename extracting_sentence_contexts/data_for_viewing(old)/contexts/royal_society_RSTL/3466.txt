+} WhenlI communicated my last memoir (** Second Series,” 1. e., par. 292. Note), the presence of this spot,
in connexion with the new doctrine of © cells,” seemed to require a modification of some of the conclusions in
my ** First Series,” as to the order of formation of the several parts of which the ovum is composed. For, pre-
suming the spot in question to be the nucleus of a cell—and (following SonLkvEx's views) necessarily existing
before the membrane of its cell—lI stated that if *uch spot were present in the corresponding membrane of
other ova, the formation of this membrane is doubtless earlier than that of the germinal vesicle itself.—l have
now to add, that later observations induce me to believe that the spot in question does not correspond to the
nucleus of a cell, but seems (as above) to denote the commencement of the formation of the black layer, such
formation appearing to begin in one of the discs by which the germinal vesicle is surrounded ; which disc then
presents the appearance of a lenticular and usually elliptic spot.—The existence of this spot, therefore, does
not affect my conclusions as to the order of formation of the several parts of the ovum ; nor do I see that the
doctrine of cells—modified as it must be by the facts made known in this memoir—affects those conclusions.
