which is easily seen to agree with the result given by Brown, or by Apams, ‘ Coll.
Works,’ L., p. 187, when we take account of the fact that

r—n!

2ixé = Qik (n—n’') t = Qic z nt,

so that, in terms of the quantity denoted by g,

«=4(1+m)g.

This example is chiefly useful here as calling attention to the fact that n’, while
not exactly equal to 1, is near to it, and consequently the factor d/(n?—1) is only
small of the first order in m,. The same weakness occurs in the terms in ¢~', ..., in
the solution. —


DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF ASTRONOMICAL INTEREST. 137

§4. In the equation considered by Hruu (‘ Coll. Works, I, p. 268) the ratio
4k,A/(n?—1) is about (2°785)-*, and there is a term slightly greater than 4k,\ (2°785)-"
arising in the terms in \’*! in the series for x, in which 44,\ is about 0°5704; and
the series fails absolutely in cases in which n is an integer. Then the assumption
that « is a power series in \*, and the terms in X which are independent of A, must
