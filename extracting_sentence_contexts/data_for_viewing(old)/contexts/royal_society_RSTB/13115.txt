monkey experiments require extensive training, in general
spanning several months (usually training takes longer than
the experiment itself). It can be, therefore, argued that their
behaviour becomes to some extent habitual or automatized:
a cognitive state that contrasts dramatically with the declara-
tive and deliberative stance of description-based choices
taken by humans [113]. In addition to that, training in mon-
keys (and other animals) often involves simplified versions
of the task (often deterministic contingencies), which may
reinforce specific risk preferences. Although the role of
extended (several days, weeks) training and the resulting
behavioural automation (or habituation) in risk preferen-
ces is unclear, it may contribute to the fact that human
description-based biases are rarely observed in monkeys.

5. Conclusion and perspectives

Our review suggests that the rhesus monkey is a partial model
of human decision-making under uncertainty. Risk preferences
in monkeys are generally better explained as experience-based
processes. Accordingly, monkeys proved to be a very good
model of human reinforcement learning processes, providing
crucial insights into its neural implementation (the dopamine
prediction error hypothesis: [56,62,114]). The situation is less
clear concerning description-based choices. In paradigms
