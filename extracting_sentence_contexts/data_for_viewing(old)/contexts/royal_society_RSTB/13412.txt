sex determination

Figure 1. Diagram representing the integration of sexual systems and mechanisms of sex determination in a common framework. The different states are represented as
discrete although in fact there is a continuum gradient of possible, intermediate, states. The idea of the evolutionary transitions along a gradient of phenotypic plasticity
was postulated by [2,4]. Epigenetic mechanisms underlie and made possible this phenotypic plasticity. Notice that environmental sex determination is mentioned both
sensu stricto (*) and sensu lato (**). See §1b. Figure is redrawn and updated from Piferrer [15].

‘ . Loe The evolution of sex chromosomes via methylation is challen-
diffe rentiation ging to test, as recently discussed by Furman eft al. [33], for

three main reasons: (i) because the relationship between
DNA methylation and gene expression can be dependent
on the genomic region being considered (e.g. [34,35]);
(ii) the fact that methylation regulation can occur in trans, i.e.
it may affect distant loci with enhancer or repressor activity;
