still further degradation will occur if opportunity is allowed for fall of temperature
by escape of energy from the system. All that it is necessary to ascertain in any
problem is the equilibrium as regards physical state and chemical constitution ct
each temperature, and the capacity of the system for heat, which specifies the
thermal change that occurs when the temperature is altered. There is no restriction
involved in taking the temperature the same throughout the system, for that is
a necessary condition of equilibrium: when it is convenient to imagine partitions
impervious to heat, the parts of the system thus separated can be treated as
independent systems. The available energy, here arrived at directly from the

* This seems to be substantially the position which Rankre took up in 1853 (“ Scientific Papers,”
p. 311): ef. also the weighty introduction to “Outlines of the Science of Energetics,’ 1858, lov. cit.,
pp- 209-220. It is in fact the standpoint of Carnor’s “ Reflexions.”

perpetual motion postulate, is the same as the free energy of von HetmHoutz’s
exposition: he has explained (“ Abhandlungen,” IL, p. 870) how its form can be
experimentally ascertained for the different phases of matter, except as regards
an undetermined part, as above, of form L + MT, where L and M are constants ;
that then the equilibrium state of a system of reacting bodies at any assigned
temperature is the one that makes it minimum for that temperature, thereby formu-
