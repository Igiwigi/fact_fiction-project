Then, unlike n = 2, =3, there is a relatively sharp Gaussian spectrum around 3.6 MHz. We have carried out simulations with 1 up to and including n = 6, but do not present them here
due to a lack of space. The fact that the waveforms and spectra of the system subjected to an RMP with fixed n as
K* are varied undergo a bifurcation-like change in an otherwise ‘smooth’ evolution is illustrated
in figure 3a-f. In figure 3a, the temporal means (i.e. a time average) of the waveforms for n =2
and each K* chosen are plotted. It shows that, starting with K* = 0 (i.e. the ‘Reference NO RMP
case’), after an initial slow linear increase up to K* =1, the values trace (as K* is increased by
0.5 at each step) a rising curve, apparently flattening around K* = 2.5.
