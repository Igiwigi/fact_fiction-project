'g heading of fertilization, the ovigerous lamella on one side formed a soft mass, the ova
2 of which were giving off the second polar body; these later formed a perfectly
a Pandit blastoderm, and had evidently been fertilized. On the other side, the ova were
S only commencing to issue from the mouth of the oviduct, and had not yet given off the
i first polar body. These, which were carefully observed under the same conditions as
=the ova on the other side, soon gave off the first polar body quite normally, and
E formed a vitelline membrane, but proceeded no further.
5 From these facts we may, I think, conclude firstly, that the entrance of the
"8 spermatozoon takes place after and independently of the formation of the first polar
E body, but before the formation of the second ; secondly, that fertilization probably
2 takes place in the mantle-cavity outside the oviduct ; and thirdly, that the formation
Zot the vitelline membrane is associated with the origin of the first polar body, and
8 S quite independent of the act of fertilization. This fact gains in interest when it is

& The vitelline membrane preserves more or less the shape of the ovum at the time
B of its formation. In nearly all Cirripedes an anterior or larger, and a posterior or
$ smaller pole are readily discernible from the first, though the difference between them
becomes accentuated as development proceeds. It appears thus that the anterior and
A posterior poles are already determined at this period. It may be that the ovum, at
first indifferent, as to which of the poles of the elongated unfertilized ovam becomes
anterior, only becomes orientated upon fertilization. Hoxxâ€™s observation on Balanus
balanoides seems to point to the conclusion that fertilization takes place at the
posterior end of the ovum, but even in this case it may be that the pole to be
