In fact, if CopELanpd had removed the osmotic
cell and the upper 9 metres of his apparatus, he would have obtained precisely the
same results as when they were present. D1rxon has shown§ that CorpELANp’s tube,
under a head of 122 centims. Hg, would not transmit 1 cub. centim. per annum,

As was perhaps first.clearly shown by ScHwENDENER,|| the vessels of actively
transpiring wood do not contain continuous water columns, but always contain
varying numbers of air-bubbles. ‘This statement has been’ confirmed by all
subsequent observers, and no theory of the ascent of sap is worthy of a moment's
consideration which does not take this fact into account. According to SrRASBURGER,
the channels containing least air are most active in the ascent of sap, but this is the
direct physical consequence of the lesser resistance to flow in the vessels more
completely filled with water. The fact that the water disappears first from the
largest vessels led SrrasBuRGER to conclude that these are more used for storage
than conduction, but here again we have a direct physical consequence of the more
