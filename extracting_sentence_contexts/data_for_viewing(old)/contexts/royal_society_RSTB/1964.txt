shared this peculiarity were briefly described.


OF SPORANGIA UPON FERN PROTHALLI. 189

Remarks oN Metuops AND THE ConpDITIoNS or CULTIVATION.

The cultures were carried out under similar conditions. It will be seen in a later
section that an explanation of the agreement existing in the results for the different
species is to be sought in this fact. The character and amount of deviation from the
conditions which exist in nature are especially important for this purpose,

The spores were sown upon soil consisting of a mixture of vegetable mould and
sand : this was thoroughly sterilised by first heating to 120° C. in a hot air steriliser,
qthen to 100° C. in the steam steriliser after it had Hedin placed in the flower pot, and

Sinally, by moistening it with boiling water. After the pot, which was covered with
we glass plate, had cooled, the spores were scattered over the surface of the soil, and
=the culture removed to the greenhouse attached to the laboratory. No fern plants
hearing sporangia were growing in this house, and no sowings were made init. The
Yair was thus kept as free as possible from floating spores, and, to further guard
