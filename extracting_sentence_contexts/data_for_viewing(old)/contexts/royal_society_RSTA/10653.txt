130 MR. B. D. STEELE ON THE MEASUREMENT OF IONIC VELOCITIES

do those for potassium chloride. The explanation of this behaviour is rendered
more difficult by the fact that the transport number for magnesium sulphate has
been determined by Hirrorr’s method, using a gelatine partition to separate the
anode and cathode portions of the-solution, ‘Two experiments made in this manner
gave 0°732 and 0°744 for the anion transport number, numbers which agree well with
the older determinations and with the figures in column 8. It is worth pointing
out that whilst p for these salts, when determined in water, shows a considerable
change with concentration, in gelatine on the other hand p is approximately constant.
