Taking the limit as h > 0, using the arbitrariness of 5 > 0 and the fact that the right-hand side of
the above does not depend on € gives us the result. a


(b) Existence of bounded weak solutions

With all the uniform estimates acquired, we can extract (weakly) convergent subsequences. In
fact, we find (we have not relabelled subsequences)

where only the first strong convergence listed requires an explanation. Indeed, the point is to
apply [24, theorem 5] with H!(Qo) Si (29) CL'(2o), which gives us a subsequence ite, —>/p
