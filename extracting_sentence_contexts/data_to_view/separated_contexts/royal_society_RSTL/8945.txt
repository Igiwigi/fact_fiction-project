branches and twigs an abundance of precisely similar bundles ; but in these plants they
are single, not in pairs. They are unmistakably the leat-bundles of the Araucaric ;
and I have no doubt that such is also the character of those in the fossil branches. Their greater number in the small branches than in the larger and more fully grown ones,
their invariable origin from the innermost surface of the ligneous cylinder, and their
apparent disappearance in the peripheral portions of the larger branches, are all facts
which point in the same direction. But why are these bundles arranged symmetrically
in pairs? Either two bundles went to one leaf with a double midrib, or the leaves were
arranged in pairs, either of which conditions may prove a possible means of identifying
these stems with their foliage, not to be lost sight of by those who are working amongst
A the plant-impressions of the Coal-measures.
