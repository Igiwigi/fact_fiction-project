268 Dr. WoLLASTON on the cutting diamond. on that side to which the greater pressure was directed, and
the cut completely fails. It might be thought that the weakness of the glee in this
part would nevertheless occasion it to break in the desired
direction ; but the bottom of a flaw is in fact of very great
breadth when compared to the simple crack produced in a
proper cut. In one case the force applied to break the glass
is dispersed over a-space of some extent, and may be di-
verted from its course; in the other the whole force is
confined successively to the mere points of a mathematical
line, which may be conceived the bottom of the fissure, and
is directed onward by the facility with which the adhesion of
each particle in succession yields to its progress. The depth to which the fissure made by the diamond pe-
netrates, need not be greater than 5; of an inch, for I found
that the fracture might be completely turned from its course,
at any part of the intended line, by grinding away a portion
of the surface; and by an average of several experiments
the thickness of the glass was not found to be diminished $0
much as +&zths of an inch,

Since the form of the cutting edge appeared from the
above trials to be the principal circumstance on which the
property of cutting depends, I thought it not improbable that
other stones possessed of the requisite hardness, might be
found to produce the same effect, if brought to a similar
curvilinear edge.
