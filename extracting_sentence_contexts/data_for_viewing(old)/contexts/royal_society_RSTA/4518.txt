this type of analysis of time series entails losing some details of the original series’ amplitude
information. Nevertheless, by just referring to the series’ intrinsic structure, a meaningful
difficulty reduction has indeed been achieved by BP with regard to the description of complex
systems. The symbolic representation of time series by recourse to a comparison of consecutive
(t =1) or non-consecutive (t > 1) values allows for an accurate empirical reconstruction of the
underlying phase-space, even in the presence of weak (observational and dynamic) noise [40].
The advantages of the method reside in (i) its simplicity, we need few parameters: the pattern
length/embedding dimension D and the embedding delay t, and (ii) the extremely fast nature of
the pertinent calculation process [44]. The BP methodology can be applied not only to time series


representative of low-dimensional dynamical systems, but also to any type of time series (regular,
chaotic, noisy or reality based). In fact, the existence of an attractor in the D-dimensional phase
space is not assumed. The only condition for the applicability of the BP methodology is a very
weak stationarity assumption (that is, for k < D, the probability for x; < x;4, should not depend
on t [40]).

To use the Bandt & Pompe [40] methodology for evaluating the PDF, P, associated with the
time series (dynamical system) under study, one starts by considering partitions of the pertinent
D-dimensional space that will hopefully ‘reveal’ relevant details of the ordinal structure of a
given one-dimensional time series X(t) = {x;; f=1,...,M} with embedding dimension D > 1
(D €N) and embedding time delay t (t € N). We are interested in ‘ordinal patterns’ of order
(length) D generated by (s)> (%s_(p—1)r/ Xs—(D-2)r/+++/Xs—r,Xs), Which assigns to each time s
the D-dimensional vector of values at times s,s — t,...,s — (D — 1)t. Clearly, the greater the D- :
value, the more information on the past is incorporated into our vectors. By ‘ordinal pattern’ :=
