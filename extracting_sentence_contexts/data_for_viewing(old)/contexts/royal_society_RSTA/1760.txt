economy. An IFE power plant must do much more than ignite a high-gain target. Commercial
power production requires many integrated systems, each with technological challenges. It must
make the targets, ignite targets repetitively, extract the heat, breed tritium from lithium and
generate electricity. Furthermore, it must do this reliably and economically.

The fully integrated system consists of four major components: a target factory to mass-
produce low-cost targets, a driver to heat and compress the targets to breed the tritium, and the
steam plant to convert fusion heat into electricity. All of these components would need to operate
over many years and with minimal downtime.

Ironically, the seeming complexity of IFE actually presents multiple business opportunities.
IFE lends itself to commercialization by the very nature of the separate components to a power
plant. Each of the four components could be a separate business proposition. In fact, the final two,
the chamber and the steam plant, are common across fusion, and indeed across advanced fission
as well. There are major industrial companies already building and innovating in these sectors.

Current IFE fusion companies are innovating in both the first and second categories. First Light
Fusion, for instance, intends to develop a target that can collapse at velocities far in excess of the
driver’s power. On the other hand, companies like Proton Scientific and Innoven are innovating
around developing new low-cost drivers. Proton Scientific is developing a way to concentrate
electron beams onto a target. Innoven is using its expertise developed from building lasers for the
American ‘Star Wars’ program to develop lower cost, more powerful lasers. Each of them has a
compelling way forward, and the inclusion of IFE technologies in recent US government grants
from ARPA-E indicate there are other business possibilities as well.
