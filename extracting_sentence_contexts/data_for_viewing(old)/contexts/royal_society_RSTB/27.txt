important of the limb. The remarkable way in which this movement is represented
in a nearly horizontal line on the cortex must not be overlooked.

Finally, fig. 8 illustrates most clearly how the mode of march is in harmony
with the representation of primary movements in the various points in the area. Thus
the movements consequential to the first movement obey the law we have already
dwelt upon, viz., that the joints are represented from above down in the area, in the
order of shoulder, elbow, wrist, digits, and thumb. The truth of this statement is
rendered very evident when fig. 7 is compared with fig, 8.

To summarise briefly the facts contained in the foregoing pages, we consider :—

1. That sulcus « (ScHAFER) corresponds to the superior frontal suleus of Man.

2. That the muscles of the upper limb are progressively represented from above
downwards, in the outer or convex surface of the hemisphere, in the order of their
size and the movements of the joints: in the order of shoulder, elbow, wrist, finger,
thumb.

3. That the joints are moved in the order of shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand
when the highest part of the area is stimulated, and in the converse order—thumb,
fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder—-when the lowest part is excited, whilst between these
extreme points the sequence of movement is commenced by a middle joint, 7.e., the
