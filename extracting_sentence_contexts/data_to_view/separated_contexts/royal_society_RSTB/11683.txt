1. Introduction

While any robot we encounter in the real world might not yet possess the
emotional intelligence of fictional robots such as C3PO or Wall-E, roboticists
are making significant strides in developing robots that can form strong
social bonds with humans, thus enabling them to provide long-term support
and possibly even companionship to people as a result [1,2]. This interest in
developing artificial agents to serve as social companions or assistants has
inspired a growing number of studies to examine the extent to which, and
under which circumstances, we might engage with ‘social’ robots as we
would with another person or pet [3,4]. One promising avenue for examining
social engagement with another agent is to measure if and how we empathize
with that agent when we observe it in apparent pain.
