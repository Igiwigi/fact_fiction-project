223. If in the above formula we put (p, g, 7)=(1, 7, 0), (Po fo 79) =(1, —7, 0), where
as usual i=x4/ —1, then the line-equation of the Absolute is £*+z*=0, or what is the
same thing, the Absolute consists of the two points in which the line z=0 intersects the
line-pair a*+z*=0; the last-mentioned line-pair, as passing through the Absolute, is by
definition a circle; it is in fact the circle radius zero, or an evanescent circle. If we
put also the coordinate z equal to unity, then the preceding assumption as to the coor-
dinates of the points of the Absolute must be understood to mean only @:y:1=1:5: 0.
or 1: —#: 0; that is, we must have «x and y infinite, and, as before, 2*+z*=0, or in
other words, the Absolute will consist of the points of intersection of the line infinit
the evanescent circle 2*+y*=0. With the values in question,
