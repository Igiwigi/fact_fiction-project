In fact, any deterministic system (one in which all probabilities are 0 or 1) is non-contextual. A
simple way of demonstrating this is as follows: a deterministic system has a single coupling,
and its subcouplings corresponding to connections (each of which is deterministic) are their only
couplings, hence maximal ones. However, if in table 6 one decides to ignore marginal probabilities, the system is maximally
contextual (and in fact more contextual than allowed by quantum mechanics). Table 7. A trivial system described by table 6 if people are instructed to choose correct responses.
