In a paper formerly communicated to this Society | by Sir
EverarD Howe, and since published in the Philosophical
Transactions for the year 180g, some facts were stated which
render it probable that the various animal secretions are depen- _
dent on the influence of the nervous system, and this opinion
seemed to derive support from some physiological experi-
ments which were afterwards instituted by myself, and in
which it was observed, that after the functions of the brain had
been destroyed, although the action of the heart continued,
and the circulation of the blood was maintained as under or-
dinary circumstances, the secreting organs invariably ceased
to perform their office. It has been attempted by former physiologists to determine
how far the nerves are necessary to secretion, but there are
considerable obstacles in the way of this inquiry, and no ob-
servations, that have been hitherto made, appear to throw a
great deal of light on the subject. The only method, which
can be devised, of ascertaining by direct experiment, whether
the nerves are really necessary to secretion, is that of divid-
ing the nervous branches by- which 'the- glands are Supplied.
