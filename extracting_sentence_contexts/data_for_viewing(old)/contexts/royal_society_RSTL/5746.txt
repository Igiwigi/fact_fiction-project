NoTE ADDED AFTER THE READING OF THE PAPER.

Throughout this paper T have asxumed the perpendicularity of the cleavage planes to the lines of maximum
force. This assumption I have made on evidence quite distinet from the facts mentioned with relation to
the perpendicularity of the horizontal traces of the cleavage and joint planes to each other. TI believe the
proper evidence of the perpendicularity of cleavage to the lines of maximum force must be sought for in
fossiliferous slate districts, where the distortion of the fossil enables us to determine the exact position of
the line of maximum force, and consequently its relation to the plane of cleavage.

The evidence of fozsils is wanting in the conglomerate of the County of Waterford, and we are cons:
quently unable to determine the precise lines of maximum force, except 80 far as the inclination of the beds
gives us information.

Having established by obseryation the existence of conjugate systems of planes, T have drawn mechanical
inferences, founded on the asxumption of the perpendicularity of cleayage to the lines of maximum foree;
and these inferences haye not, of course, the same degree of evidence in their fayour that the geometrical
