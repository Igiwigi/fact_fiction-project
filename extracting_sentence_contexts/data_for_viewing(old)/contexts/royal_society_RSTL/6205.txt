C*H* and C” H*® have often been vaguely applied to the numerous isomers of turpentine,
yet none of the hydrocarbons obtained by the above chemists have been shown to con-
tain C'® H® for four volumes of vapour. The hydrocarbon discovered by CourrBe® in
the fluid obtained by the powerful compression of resin gas, although of the same com-
poxition, differs too much in density (0-709) and boiling-point (50?) to be considered as
identical.

Action of Atmospheric Oxygen on Tsoprene.

If isoprene be left in a partly filled bottle for some months, it gradually loses its
Aluidity, and at last even becomes quite viscid ; at the same time it is found to have
iequired powerful bleaching properties. It readily decolorizes sulphate of indigo, and,
Sunder certain cireumstances, converts sulphide of lead into sulphate. It is, in fact,
Sozonized.

5 ScnoONBEIN was the first to show that oil of turpentine absorbed ozone when kept for
Y lorg time, and I subsequently obseryed seyeral cases where ozone was capable of exist-
Ang in contact with organic and inorganic matters without exerting any material action
:Zon them 80 long as the temperature was kept down. In these instances, immediately
Zthe heat rose beyond a certain point, the substance in contact with the ozone underwent
2oxidation. 'Thus, if a 8lip of lead test-paper be exposed to the vapours of suwlphide of
Znydrogen until the paper has acquired a deep brown colour, and a drop of an ozonized
Svil be placed on it, no change ensnes at ordinary temperatures ; but if the paper moist-
Sened with the oil be warmed until the latter begins to volatilize, the sulphide is imme-
Etiately oxidized and bleached.
