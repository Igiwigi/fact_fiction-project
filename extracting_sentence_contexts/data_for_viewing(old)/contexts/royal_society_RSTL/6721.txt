SUN'S MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH. 515

On the existence of a variation of diurnal range of Declination at St. Helena
depending on the Sun's altitude.

When we express the diurnal variations of declination at St. Helena for the different

months of the year in the form (y),
A,=Bsin (þ+3)+C in 2(h+:)+D sin 3(h+:),

the values of the coefficients B, C, D are seen to be larger about the time when at noon
the sun is overhead at St. Helena, which occurs in the first weeks of February and
November, than they are immediately before or after. This fact indicates the existence
of a 8econdary variation of the diurnal range of declination which has maximum yalues
at the times mentioned, and which is additional to the variation of range caused by the
semiannual inequality discovered by General SABINE. 'The monthly values of B, C,
EZ and D are shown in the following Table :—
