Similarly for the other of the compatible equations, there is an intermediary
integral involving the two arbitrary functions. The conditions of coexistence of the
two intermediary integrals must be assigned ; it will appear that, if the conditions
are not satisfied identically, they provide the means of identification of the various
arbitrary functions.

It is to be observed that the intermediary integral or integrals thus obtained
cannot be regarded as intermediary integrals of the original equation in the ordinary
sense of the phrase, for each of them involves two arbitrary functions. But they
are intermediary for the respective compatible equations: each of them involves one
arbitrary function more than occurs in the compatible equation. The result mani-
festly does not imply that the original equation possesses any intermediary integral ;
in fact, the assumption throughout our investigations has been that no proper
intermediary integral exists.

25. A methodt has been given elsewhere for constructing the intermediary integral.
In effect, it amounts to the use of the conditions which must be satisfied in order
that the derivatives

any + hin + Gy, + Ue = 0
hy + Dim + fitn + vy = 0
gia + film + ch + u. = 0

from the supposed integral
u (i,m, n, v, @, y, 2) = 0
