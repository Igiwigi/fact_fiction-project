we may take instead of the four expressions P, Q, R, S, the six

and any two of these equated to zero, or any one of them combined with
T=T,+mUT,=0, will serye for the two equations required. From these it is easy to
see that, in the same way as in < 1, it may be shown that the Hyperjacobian surfaces
touch the surface U at the principal points of the system.

But in this case we may carry the question of the contact of the Hyperjacobians a
step further. In fact, bearing in mind that if p, q be any two rational, integral, and
homogeneous functions of x, y, 2, 7, the nature of the operation A is such that, if we put

A=(A, B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N)(d., d,, d., ®,)*, . - . - (8)

This being 80, if we put
