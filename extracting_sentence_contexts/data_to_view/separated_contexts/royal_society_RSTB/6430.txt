into
normal vegetative cells. In an attempt to analyse the factors responsible for the formation of resting spores
let us begin with the observations recorded at the beginning of this section and in
Tables Iâ€”III. The outstanding facts are as follows: (1) No resting spores were formed
before the cultures reached the age of 9, 13, and 18 days respectively. During this
period the cells reproduced actively and the Petri dish cultures reached a density of

30,000-50,000 cells in about 35 c.c. of fluid, i.e. about 1000 cells per c.c. of culture
medium. (2) There followed a period of 9-15 days with formation and subsequent
germination of a great number of resting spores.
