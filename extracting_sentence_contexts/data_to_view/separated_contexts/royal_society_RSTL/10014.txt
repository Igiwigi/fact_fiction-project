(2) That the
excitatory effect produced at this distance is unmodified by further approximation. (3) That the distance of the secondary coil at which the first response takes place,
when in a snecession of excitations it is gradually approximated, is much greater
when the induction current, is directed from the upper to the under surface than in
the contrary case; in other words, that the leaf responds to a weaker current when
it is directed downwards than when it is directed upwards; and, finally (4) That if
one current of an intensity a little less than 8ufficient to eyoke a response be followed
at a short interval of time by a second current of similar intensity, the latter may
be effectual. This last fact will be reverted to further on, under the head of

Ereitatory influence of the voltaic current. For the purpose of studying the influence of a weak voltaic current, a rheochord of
Platinum wire was used, of which the length was 14 feet and the resistance 20 ohms ;
this was interpolated in the circuit of a Daxter cell, Currents could be derived
from it and conducted through the leaf by connecting one electrode with the end of
the rheochord, the other with any point of its length by a slider. Tn this case the
derived current might, in consequence of the relatively high resistance of the plant, be
regarded as proportional to the length of wire between the end block and the «lider.
