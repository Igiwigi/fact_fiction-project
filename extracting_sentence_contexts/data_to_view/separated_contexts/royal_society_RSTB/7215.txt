When white light illuminates the test object it is a yellow-green cluster which
is selected because the rays of this hue have a higher visual luminosity than have the red
and blue rays, and because the yellow-green rays, being more sharply focused than the
rest, play in consequence, a more prominent part in the perception of fine detail. Now
these different clusters, employed with lights of different spectral composition and different
intensity, not only differ in position in the retina, but differ in shape as well. An examina-
tion of the Lumiere screen discloses the fact that no two clusters are precisely the same either
in size, shape or make-up. Some are almost spherical, some are elliptical, some are spiral
and so on. Like pebbles they vary one from another, and no two are exactly alike.
