Our model serves as a platform to understand the complicated structure that might be
encountered in nearly singular solutions of three-dimensional Euler fluid equations. In future work, we will extend the applications of the continuous symmetry approach to three-
dimensional Euler fluid models beyond the symmetry plane and to systems involving more
interacting fields, such as magnetohydrodynamics. Moreover, we will combine the continuous
symmetry approach with the current Cauchy invariants lore to generate a hierarchy of new
Cauchy invariants, as theorem 2.11 is in fact a particular case of the result that the Lie derivative
of any Lie-conserved tensor along a symmetry is a new Lie-conserved tensor, which is exact if the
original one is. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
