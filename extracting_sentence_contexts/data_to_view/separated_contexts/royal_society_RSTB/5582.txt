ammonium nitrate was used as the source
of nitrogen in place of the usual 0-2 per cent. sodium nitrate. Both species of Fumago give balance sheets which are decidedly interesting fiom
a biochemical point of view, although they are slightly different in type, because of the
fact that, while Ag. 63 gives appreciable amounts of volatile neutral compounds
(0-320 gm.), Ag. 92 gives only a negligible amount of the same type of compound
(0-010 gm.). Of particular interest is the large amount of “carbon unaccounted
for” given by both species and amounting to 0-512 gm. (15 per cent.
