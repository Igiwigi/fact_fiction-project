Reviewing the definition of the Helmholtz number, it is evident that instead of
increasing the branch length reducing sufficiently the celerity could produce the same effect. However, considering the Kortweg-Moens approximation [13,14], the material would have to
be very compliant and then structural integrity issues have to be taken into account. This fact
limits the available options regarding tube materials when for example high pressure hydraulics
are considered or extensive hosing effects might manifest. A different approach could be to enhance reflection characteristics of the HQ tube by
introducing modulated branches. A very recent study [15] introduces the concept of the Virtual
HQ tube.
