He does not describe the true epithelial structure lying over the pigment layer,
which in the majority of specimens falls away in the processes of hardening, deealei-
fying, cutting, and staining.

The micro-photographs (Plate 1, figs. 1 and 2) show clearly the points which I have
endeavoured to describe, and clearly do not give any support to the observations of
Porta. .

At the same time they effectually nullify the views I held in 1916 as to the
significance of the canals, nipple-shaped projections, and filamentous processes.

It appears to me that the specimens just described establish the following facts :â€”

1. That the specialised epithelium on the tail where the spine commences is the
first appearance of the true glandular epithelium.

2. That the glandular epithelium occupying the more superficial portion of the
glandular triangle of the groove is the essential poison-producing tissue.

3. That the mass of epithelial cells shows cells in an active state of secretory
activity, and that the products of this activity are discharged towards the dentate
margin.

4, That the pigmented capillary network is of the same nature as that described
