Plant sex chromosomes are not without consequences
from suppressed recombination. A consistent pattern found
is an enrichment of transposable elements (TEs) and other
repeats [77,88-90], which often accumulate in regions of
low recombination [91]. In fact, in several species TE expan-
sions have instead driven the Y chromosome to be larger
than the X, such as in Coccinia grandis [92] and S. latifolia
[93]. This pattern is counter to the smaller-Y heteromorphy
found in the insects studied in Stevens’ day. While many Y
chromosomes in animals are also riddled with repeats, in
well-studied species most of the genes have been lost [94—
97].
