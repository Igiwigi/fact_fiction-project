But this D=5 U(1) symmetry mixes the various gauge and scalar
field mode levels in a complicated way. Covert symmetry breaking is intrinsically a phenomenon
related to a low-energy approximation, in which the massive higher modes are not independently
excited, but are integrated out using the leading-order results of their field equations. That such a phenomenon can occur starting at quartic order may be expected on general
grounds, as well as the fact that when it does occur, it cannot be fully remedied by field
redefinitions [8]. What can be altered by field redefinitions, however, is the presentation of the
phenomenon. The leading-order effective theory is obtained by integrating out all higher massive
modes.
