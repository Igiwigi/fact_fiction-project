Thus (fig. 19) if ab ed be the
Section of the ray, an edge parallel to ab, after the ray has been disposed, will affect
the ray greatly, provided it had been disposed by an edge also parallel to ab. The
sides a 6 and cd, however, are alone affected; and therefore the second edge, if placed
parallel to a d or bc, will not at all bend the ray more or make images (or fringes) more
powerfully than it would do if no previous flexion and disposition had taken place. Let
us see how this is in fact: ef'g h is the distended disc after flexion, by passing through
the aperture of the two-edged instrument (Plate XI.). It is slightly tinged with red at
the two ends f'g and eh, beyond which, and in the shadow of the edges, are the usual
fringes or coloured images by flexion and disposition, e, c, the edges being parallel to
eh,fg. Place another edge at some distance from the two, as 3 or 4 inches, and
parallel to these two, but in the light, and you will see in the disc a succession of
narrow fringes parallel to the edges, and in front of the third edge's shadow.
