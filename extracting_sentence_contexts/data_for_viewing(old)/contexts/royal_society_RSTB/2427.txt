number to be uniformly 32. It is possible that under certain cireum-
stances the last divisions of the sporogenous group may be omitted, and
that Kwyy’s estimate was based upon such specimens. A_ similar
variation of number has been noted for Cyathea dealbata (8 to 16), and
for Todea barbara (256 to 512).

33. Lomartia. § Eulomaria.

L. Patersoni, Sprenc., and L. media (?), both from the Edinburgh Botanic
Gardens, have been examined. The sorus is mixed; the sporangia
have no definite orientation; the annulus is definitely interrupted at
the stalk, though it may show some slight signs of being oblique. The
number of spores is 48 to 64. In fact, there is in these species no
feature calling for special remark, as distinct from allied genera. This
result is not in accord with the observations of Merrrentus,t who
described and figured for Lomaria Patersoni a sporangium with an
oblique annulus, and a thick stalk. I have not found this in the
specimens from the Edinburgh Garden; the annulus is definitely
interrupted at the stalk, though it may be slightly oblique. This has
been verified also on material from the Glasgow Herbarium.

Lomaria, § Plagiogyria.

This section of the genus was distinguished first by Kunze,{ and afterwards
