This value of k is

The calculated flow laws for D2O (figure 5) do not fit the measured data as well as the H2O
data. The observed differences may be due to relatively large errors on the calculated value of
k, the scarcity of DO data points, and the fact that the D2O experiments were carried out on
two different experimental set-ups. Again, we can suggest that a GSS deformation mechanism
is present at the lowest strain-rate for the 10vol.% data. Unfortunately, there are currently
insufficient data to confirm this, or to deduce whether any change in deformation mechanism
occurs in D2O samples at similar strain-rates to those found in H20.
