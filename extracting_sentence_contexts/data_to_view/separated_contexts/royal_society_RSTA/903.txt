All that is needed in practice
is that the record made in the apparatus (e.g. the position of its pointer) must be ‘repeatably
accessible’. Frequently, one does not care about repeated measurements of the quantum system
(which may even be destroyed in the measurement process). Axiom (iii) captures in fact the
whole idea of a record—it has to persist in spite of being read, copied, etc. So one can impose
the requirement of repeatability at the macroscopic level of an apparatus pointer with a much
better physical justification than Dirac did for the microscopic measured system. The proof of §3
then goes through essentially as before, but the details (and how far one can take the argument)
depend on specific settings.
