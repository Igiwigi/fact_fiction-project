but with opposite sign. The result implies that the structure possesses an alternating strain
deformation ahead of the bridge crack front [36]. In all admissible regimes computed below, this
behaviour located at 7 < 0 is typical during the bridge fracture process. In fact, in the next sections,
we demonstrate that it is the behaviour of the structure within the bridge crack zone at 7 > 0 that
provides an upper speed limit for this failure regime.


Additionally, the analytical model developed above assumes (0) = tc, which is the case for
all trajectories shown in figure 3. For 7 >1, the trajectories undergo oscillations. This results
from the release of waves during the bridge fracture process that travel outward to the right of
the front. In relation to this, as demonstrated in figure 3, for n > 0 the displacement amplitude
of even-numbered nodes can increase with increasing a, whereas the displacement amplitude
of the odd-numbered nodes will decrease. Physically, this observation corresponds to the fact
that stiffer vertical links will prohibit the odd-numbered nodes for n > 0 from undergoing large
displacements, whereas the less constrained even-numbered nodes in this region will be more
prone to excitation.

(c) Energy ratio dependency on the bridge crack speed

In figure 4, we show the dependency of the energy ratio y on the bridge crack speed that has been
computed using (4.6) for the three structures considered.

The behaviour of y can be described with two distinct regimes: (i) a regime where y grows
monotonically with increasing v and approaches unity when v â€” oo; and (ii) a regime occurring at
low speeds, where the value of y can oscillate rapidly with increasing v. For regime (i), indicated
