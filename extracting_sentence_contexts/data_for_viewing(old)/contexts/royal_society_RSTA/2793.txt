[w1,w2]=—w3,  [w2,w3]= wi, [w3,w1]= —we. (6.28)

With these relations, we obtain

and qatar:

These equations are Hamiltonian with respect to a degenerated Poisson bracket. In fact, denoting
x = (M1,M2,M3,z,p) and
0 M3 -M, 0 0
-M3 0 Mi 0O 0
P=|M, M O 0 OO], (6.30)
0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 -1 0

we can write system (4.29) in the form
