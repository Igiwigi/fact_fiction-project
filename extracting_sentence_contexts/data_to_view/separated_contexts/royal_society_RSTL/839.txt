But it is evident that some other action takes place;
for, sulphuric acid, which has a stronger affinity for oxide of
platina than muriatic acid, does not in the least promote the
decomposition of nitric acid by gold, or by platina. CONCLUSION. The substance which has been treated of in this Paper, must
convince us how dangerous it is to form a theory before we are
provided with a sufficient number of facts, or to 5ubstitute the
results of a few observations, for the general laws of nature. If
a theory is sometimes useful, as a standard to which we may
refer our knowledge, it is at other times prejudicial, by creating
an attachment in our minds to preconceived ideas, which have
been admitted without inquiring whether from truth or from
convenience. We easily correct our judgment as to facts; and
the evidence of experiment is equally convincing to all persons.
