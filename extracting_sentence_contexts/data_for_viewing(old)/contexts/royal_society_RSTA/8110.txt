These two photographs, which are shown joined together, relate to the first 4} metres
run of a “ detonation ” induced by the explosion of a d, “ detonator ” in a pure undiluted
acetylene medium. It will be seen that “ spin” (p = 5-69 ems.) was well developed
in the flame front after a 40 cms. run, the V, at this point being 2,160 metres per second.
And it continued until the forward flame-speed had fallen to about 1,470 metres per
second. A very curious feature of this explosion, which is well shown in the photo-
graphs, is the subsequent occurrence of a non-luminous region between the ‘highly
luminous flame-front and the luminous carbon in its rear; and it is now being further -
investigated by us.

No. 30.—Explosions initiated by a * detonator”? in (a) a 4C,N, + O, and (6) a N,O
Medium, respectively, in a Tube 1-3 ems. internal diameter.
The interest of these two photographs lies in the fact of their both showing signs of

a “spinning head” in the flame-front just before the latter ceased to be visible at forward
flame-speeds of approximately 1,400 metres per second.

No. 31.—Bursting of a Detonator (d.) in Air in a Tube of 1-3 ems. internal diameter.

Showing a “banded structure” presumably due to “ spin” in the incandescent
gaseous products following the “ shock wave ” from the detonator.
