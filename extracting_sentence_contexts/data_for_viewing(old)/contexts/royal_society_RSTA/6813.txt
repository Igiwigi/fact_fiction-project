for the second of (12), leading to a corresponding substitution of

a\2 a,

for the second of (28). Thereby we avoid the difficulty associated with that governing
equation; but x, still appears in the first of (28), and it can be eliminated only by a use
of the boundary condition at Q and a consequent introduction of y,. Ifa is an internal
point, all fictitious values will have been eliminated: if « is an external point, it can in
turn (theoretically) be eliminated, and the process can be continued down the line
1-8-« until eventually the boundary is crossed; but in practice little benefit would
be gained by advancing beyond «. Every case calls for special devices ad hoc, and no
problem, in our experience, has presented great difficulty. Sometimes a sufficiently
good approximation is to replace (0x/0r)»p by (0x/dr)o: in other cases (yp being always
known) jf, can be obtained by interpolation and (12) A can then be interpreted as the
equation governing x.

Example 3. Straight tube loaded with a belt of uniform pressure

23. Binnie (1941) has treated, by extension of a method due to Filon (1902), the case
of ashort thick tube which is stressed by a belt of uniform pressure applied to its external
