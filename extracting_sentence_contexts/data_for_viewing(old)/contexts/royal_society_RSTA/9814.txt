above, however, it is seen how these changes of direction can be explained by lateral
displacements. It is noticeable that where the irregularity observed in the first. lines
as compared with the others in the satellite differences appears, a similar irregularity
exists also in connection with the first order differences. This is evident especially in
the alkalies, where the first differences are so close to exact multiples of A or é as to
cause the conviction that they really are so.

372 DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

It is a remarkable fact also, and one which will probably be of importance in
throwing light on molecular constitution, that all those elements which do not
exhibit satellites have order differences depending on multiples of A, whereas all the
others (Al excepted) depend on multiples of the oun, é or d,. The elements without
satellites are Na, K, Mg, possibly Al, both series of O, and §. All these depend on
multiples of A, or A, None of the others do so, and it may be regarded as an
argument in favour of Rb possessing satellite series that its differences do not depend
on A directly. It would appear that Rb only begins to show them for m= 3, For
m = 2 the line is not split up into a chief line and satellite, the doublet separation is
normal, and it is instructive to observe that the order separation between the first
set and second line is close to 5A, and only deviates from it in the same way that is
mentioned in the previous paragraph. Also Ba seems to have in the same way no
satellite for m = 2, the separation is quite normal, and this also shows a first order
