mean values. Neither Exsrer and Gerren nor Gocket observed between 8 P.M.
and 8 A.M, and as the values I found between those hours were very much the
largest it is not right to compare my means with their means, so in what follows
I use only the values which were obtained during the morning and afternoon

observations in Karasjok.

The means for the whole year are Wolfenbiittel 18°6, Freiburg 84 and Karasjok 60,
Thus Freiburg is the highest and Wolfenbiittel the lowest. The absolute maxima
(between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) are Wolfenbiittel 64, Freiburg 420, Karasjok 384, i.e.,
the same order as before.

It is a strange fact that the yearly period should be so marked in Karasjok, while
no yearly period can be detected in either Wolfenbiittel or Freiburg. As stated
above, neither Etster and Gerret nor GockEL have observed after 8 P.M., so it is
impossible to compare the daily periods. It would be exceedingly interesting to
know if there is a large daily variation in mid-Europe, for if there is not, then the
mean winter value of the radio-activity in Karasjok will be very high compared with
mid-Europe, the mean for the winter, when night as well as day observations are
taken into account, being 126 at Karasjok.

GocKEL’s maximum observation of 420 was quite an exception, but even that was
exceeded by my absolute maximum of 432 (observed between 8 and 10 P.M. on
December 17). With this one exception the values found by Gocken did not
exceed 170, while I found 200 quite a medium value: during the winter in Karasjok.
