great, at least ten times as much as I expected ; which fact
indicated, beyond a doubt, that if the roller is to be trusted at
all, it must only be trusted through a very short arc. Had
there been-any thing slippery in the action, which would have
been indicated by measuring the same part at different times
differently, there would have been an end of it at once; but,
that not being the case in any sensible degree, the roller be-
comes an useful auxiliary to fill up short intervals, whose
limits have been corrected by more certain means.*

®* There are two things in the foregoing account of the action of the roller which
have a tendency to excite surprise. The first is, that the roller should, in different
-parts of its journey round the circle, measure the latter 50 differently. One would not
