lower to begin with. The dome-shaped andreecial region is now flattening out, and a line
drawn through the points of insertion of all the members clearly indicates the changes
in the shape of the floral axis (fig. 18: 11; fig. 19: 12; bud, 1°5 mm. high). Such a
bud indicates recognisably the construction of the adult flower, with the exception of
active growth in the secondary zones of extension.

Special Mechanism. —Comparing these stages with the longitudinal section along
the orthostichy line of the cone, which gives median sectional elevation of successive
flowers, in such a sequence it is easy to follow the overlapping of the perianth-
members, though the prophylls are not indicated, the growth of the staminal tube,
and the remarkable extension of the stylar integument, while the apical nucellar
region remains small. In the 1°5 mm. bud the stylar region begins to show a
tendency to bend towards the posterior side; this being due to the fact that the
posterior stamen, like the posterior perianth-segment, shows a slightly advanced rate
of growth, as compared with the corresponding anterior members, with the result
that the posterior pair of anthers push over those of the anterior stamens. This
increased rate of growth of the posterior side of the flower has no reference to the
shape of the bud as a whole, which, notwithstanding its position between the close-
fitting cone-scales, remains remarkably symmetrical (fig. 16: 12; fig. 19: 12).

Little remains to be added to the growth-factors of the flower, and buds almost
full grown thus present definite features of construction (fig. 20). The prophylls are
overtaken by the other members, and no longer enclose the bud; the perianth-
segments become relatively thinner, though maintaining their overlapping edges
which seal the bud-chamber, the connate region (a gamophyllous zone of growth)
