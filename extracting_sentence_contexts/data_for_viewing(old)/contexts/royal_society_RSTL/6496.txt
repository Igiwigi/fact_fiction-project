This is not to be considered as a list of missing nebulee, but merely of objects which
were not found in the ordinary course of observing, and to which therefore it is desirable
that attention should be directed. They have not been looked for since this list was
made out.

The engravings of the Nebulz are extremely faithful; there is, however, a slight
inaccuracy which it is necessary to notice, and for which we are to blame, not the
engraver. Many of the principal stars are too large. The error arose in this way. The
stars were inserted in common, not Indian ink, and, the drawings during their transmis-
8ion by post becoming slightly damp, the ink made its way into the paper, the dots in
8ome cases becoming small blots. In a few instances it was necessary to set this right
to prevent misconception, and some alteration was in consequence made in the Plates;
but as to the remainder, we thought it sufficient to state the fact generally, that many
of the principal stars were somewhat too large. This remark applies especially to
figures 1 and 3, Plate XXV., and to figures 24, 28, 29, 30, 34, Plate XXVIIL.
