The balance of the evidence recorded, is
undoubtedly in favour of the last-mentioned mode of explanation. Indeed, it seems
to us that, if there be not experimental error, there is fixation within the soil, under
the influence of micro-organisms, or other low forms. Assuming that definite decision on the point must wait for further evidence and
discussion, it will nevertheless be well, in the meantime, to consider the facts of
agricultural production in their bearing on the question, with a view of forming a
judgment as to how far the establishment of the reality of the fixation of free nitrogen,

- either by the plant or by the soil, is so essential for the solution of the problems which
such production presents, as is by some supposed. It has been seen that much of the investigation that has been undertaken in recent
years, has been instigated by the assumption that there must exist natural compensa-
tion for the losses of combined nitrogen which the soil suffers by the removal of crops,
and for the losses which result from the liberation of free nitrogen from its combina-
tions under various circumstances. In some cases, however, the object seems to have
been for the most part limited to an attempt to solve the admitted difficulty as to the
explanation of the source of the whole of the nitrogen of the Leguminose.
