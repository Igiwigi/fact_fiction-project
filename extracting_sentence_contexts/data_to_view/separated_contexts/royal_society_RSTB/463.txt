Mr. Tomes has kindly lent me some of his specimens, preserved in balsam and in
glycerine jelly. In these latter preparations the great majority of the processes
attached to the blood-vessels are precisely similar in appearance to the fibres I have

the flattened fibres look very like cells, but are distinguished by the absence of
nucleus. T think it is these fibres which clothe the blood-vessels that are in close apposition
to them in their course through the pulp tissue, and it appears highly probable that
in teasing out the pulp in any fluid medium, the blood vessels would be likely to”
draw away with them this layer of fibres from its attachment to the dentine.
