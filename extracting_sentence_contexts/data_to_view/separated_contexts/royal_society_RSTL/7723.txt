5 X{ZW(eX+dY)—3X(ae—Þ?, ad—be, b—&LX, YY} =0,

=

So that the Hessian breaks up into the plane X=0 (axial or common biplane) and into

A cubic surface. =) The complete intersection of the Hessian with the cubic swrface is made up of the
ine X=0, Y=0 (the axis) four times; and of a system of four conics, which is the

:Zpinode curye; C=8. ie In fact combining the equations

WXZ—+(a, b, c, FX, YY=0

ZW(eX+dY)—3X(ac—HP, ad—be, bl—AFX,YY=0,

Shese intersect in the axis once, and in a curve of the eighth order which breaks up

Into four conics; for we can from the two equations deduce

[=

F= (a, b, 6, FX, YY(eX+dY)+8X(ac—Pb, ad—dbe, b4—&@YX, YY*=0,

Shat is,

5 (440—3P, ad, bd, cd, LX, Y)'=0,

E system of four planes each intersecting the cubic XAW +(«, 6, c, 4XX, Y)*=0 in the
xis and a conic; whence, as aboye, spinode curve is four conics. S It iseasy to see that the tangent planes along any conic on the surface pass through

a point, and form therefore a quadric cone; hence in particular the spinode torse is
made up of the quadric cones which touch the surface along the four conics respectively.
