Each of these varied considerably in amount from year to year according
= to the character of the season ; but each of the three gave by far the most in the
8econd separation-year, which, it will be remembered, was extremely favourable for
Miscellanez generally ; indeed, in that year the quantity both of Jtumez and of
Conopodium was extremely large. Tn each of the other years the Rumen gave more
than the other two together. In fact, it is obvious that the conditions were, notwith-
standing the severe competition of the free-growing grasses, very specially fayourable
for this vigorous, free-seeding, and objectionable weed. In actual yield, each of these three most prominent of the miscellaneous species gave
much more, on the average, than without manure, especially the /umex ; but of the
numerous species, taken collectively, none of which have yielded one per cent. to the

total herbage, there was much less growing on this plot of great Inxuriance of grazses
than without manure.
