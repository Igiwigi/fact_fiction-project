Furthermore, to test whether this up-regu-
lation is transient or sustained, we analysed the transcript
levels in HU transcriptomes that were prepared at several
time points after HU withdrawal (figures 3a and 5d,f). This
analysis shows that the expression levels of the HU-induced
NG and NT genes are progressively increased over time,
suggesting a sustained up-regulation (figure 5d,f). In fact
we found these genes still up-regulated when tested by
qPCR after 23 days (not shown). Beside epithelial genes,
nine up-regulated genes exhibit the typical gland cell signa-
ture, these encode the anticoagulant antistasin, the
Dickkopf-related proteins Dkk1/2/4A, Dkk1/2/4C, the
metalloendopeptidase MEP1B, the Ser-protease inhibitors
Kazal-1, -2, -4, -5, the plasminogen-related serine protease
Sp! (see their RNA-seq profiles and ISH gland cell pattern
in electronic supplementary material, S9). The gland cell-
specific expression was actually independently established
for Antistasin [64], Dkk1/2/4A [20], Dkk1/2/4C [65], Kazall1
[66] and Kazal2 [67].
