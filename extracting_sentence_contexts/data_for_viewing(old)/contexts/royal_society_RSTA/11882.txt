Up to three minutes the resistance was 2°8 X 10" ohms.

From three to ten minutes mean resistance was 4°41 X 10" ohms.

. It is not easy to get very accurate values, because the change is always going on,
and the discontinuous conduction makes it necessary to have several observations at
each point.

To test whether Oum’s law was obeyed, we applied a voltage of 155 volts, and took
the resistance both ways, up to three minutes, reversing several times first. The
mean value was R = 4°69 X 10", instead of 2°6 x 10”, when we used the higher
voltage. This result was probably affected both by the fact that the large voltage
was applied first, and by the influence of the time action, though the latter was
eliminated so far as possible. We do not think that the deviation from Oum’s law
observed can be explained away by any of these effects. A substance, whose
conductivity may be a function of the quantity of electricity which has passed
through it, can hardly be expected to obey Ouw’s law.

On November 29, after the sulphur had been allowed to rest, the resistance was
found, by reversing the battery (312 volts), and allowing the voltage to remain on for
three minutes each way. The two sets of deflections were nearly equal, showing that
a steady state had been reached. The resulting value was

Resistance = 3°6 X 10!? ohms,
