Sproximation to a low-sun mountain spectrum, it has some radical differences there-

EProfexor STOKEs indeed snggests, that the deficiency of the red end of my high-sun
Suntain spectra may be due to the more luminous rays extinguishing the faint red ;

eparated by refraction through a second prism, A might have been seen ; just as in fact
twas seen with the low-swn spectra, when the atmosphere acted the part of a snitable

tis proper to state, that on Teneriffe the magnifying power employed was such, as neces-
arily to throw the brightest part of the spectrum out of the field of view when the
