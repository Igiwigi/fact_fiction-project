This yields both a pay-off of +i, as compared with 0 if they trade on separate markets. We assume
m <M. (This inequality makes sense since, even if they sell different assets, they still compete in
purchasing the third one.)

If M is sufficiently large compared with m, any good pair of strategies for the traders must
preclude their selling the same asset on the same market. In fact, the following is optimal for the
traders. Ann goes to market 2 only when she needs to sell asset Z, while Bob goes to market 1 only
when he needs to sell Z. (By symmetry, we can replace Z by X or Y, and market 2 with market 1.)
To calculate the resulting expected pay-off to the traders, note that there are nine equally likely
cases according to whether Ann wants to sell asset X, Y or Z, and similarly for Bob. In four of
these cases, the above strategy profile secures a pay-off of +m, and otherwise 0.
