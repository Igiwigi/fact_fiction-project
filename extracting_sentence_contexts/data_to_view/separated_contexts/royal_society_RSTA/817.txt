The theorem states that tangencies of the
stable and unstable manifolds associated with unstable equilibria and PO generate an infinite
number of period doubling and CS bifurcations. Hence, the originally single unstable PO (named
Lyapunov orbits) of the fundamental families of index-1 saddles are expected to generate such CS
bifurcations as their manifolds expand along the unstable degree of freedom. As a matter of fact, intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds coming either from
the same or different Lyapunov PO generate homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits respectively [21],
which connect remote regions of phase space. Their numerical location is not easy and that
makes PO families more precious in studying the entanglement of the molecular phase space
at high excitation energies. For polyatomic molecules the large number of index-1 saddles
and their associated Lyapunov families of PO, which are spread over the configuration space,
generate a network of heteroclinic/homoclinic orbits, where trajectories may be trapped.
