is formed between the outer and inner of these egg-sac membranes. The mesochite
eventually ruptures at the apex, owing to the more rapid gelatinisation of an area of
this region of the membrane. Finally, the endochite, together with the partition walls
between the individual oospheres, also disappears, by dissolving in the water as
mucilage, and the eggs are thereby set free in the water. Sometimes the endochite
and partition walls have already become unrecognisable, even before extrusion from
the conceptacle has been accomplished.

A less usual variant occurs in F, vesiculosus and F. serratus, and in Ascophyllum
when the partition walls, instead of swelling up and disappearing, split so as to form,
together with portions of the endochite, coverings for the individual eggs. And it
may happen that the membrane thus remaining round each egg does not disappear at
all, however long they may be kept in the sea-water. This fact has its bearing on
TuuRET's eXperiments on unfertilised eggs to be referred to later.

As regards Ascophyllum, Tourer has figured (“Rt. Phye.,” XXII, 12) a case which
frequently occurs in this species, although, as far as our material is concerned, not
the most common one, We find that in the majority of instances there is no sharply-

defined membrane present, but that a general swelling of the mesochite is more usual,
At the beginning of the swelling a beautiful and delicate stratification is visible, and
if stained with methylene blue a number of fine secondary pits become visible in it.
