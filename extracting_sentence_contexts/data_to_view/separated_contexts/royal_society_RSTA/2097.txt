This ‘net’ of subalgebras is the mathematical structure relevant to describing LQFT. However, this does not appear to be the correct mathematical structure for describing a
gravitational theory. In fact, already at the perturbative level, we discover that this local algebraic
structure must fail. Consider a scalar field ¢(x), coupled to gravity. While [¢(x),@(y)] =0 for
spacelike x-y, (x) is not a gauge-invariant observable.
