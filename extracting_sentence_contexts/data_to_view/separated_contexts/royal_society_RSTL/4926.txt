All the recesses and ramifications of the general cavity of the body in the Annelids
communicate freely with each other, constituting thus one common space. This
space is lined by a distinct membrane, which is obviously the anatomical analogon of
the peritoneum, and is filled by a fluid which is wngquestionably an organic fluid, In
the Annelida the peritoneal membrane is not vibratile, the oscillations of the fluid
contents cannot therefore be due to ciliary vibration. This fact distinguishes the
Annelids from the Echinoderms, Medus# and Zoophytes : it further proves that the
movements of the chylaqueous fluid are not in ALL cases dependent on the presence
of cilia. The rule is snspended in this class. In Glycera alba, and in one or two
other species, however, the peritoneum where it penetrates the appendage is lined by
vibratile cilia.
