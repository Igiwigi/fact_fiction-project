at the same time the atmosphere was charged with sulphurous odours. Some of the
stones were almost the size of a hen’s egg, but they did little damage in the town
except to the large-leaved trees, some of which had their foliage perforated or torn to
shreds ; many of them were covered with a thin layer of wet mud. Then smaller
stones began to fall “like a sharp shower of hail,” and these were followed by little
pellets of fine moist ash “ about the size of small sago.” Dry ash followed, and this
formed the bulk of the shower, becoming somewhat finer, lighter in colour, and less
abundant as the evening wore on, It had a sulphurous smell, though some compared
the odour rather to that of guano. Mr. Powe.t, of the Botanic Gardens, informed
us that the foliage of the more tender plants was blighted and turned yellow, and
all the forward bread-fruit dropped, not from the weight, but from the nature of the
ash. The plants with stout thick leaves suffered comparatively little damage, and in
fact it was noticed that a few days afterwards their foliage was cleaner, greener, and
more free from insects than before, so that there was reason to believe that the
ash had insecticidal properties.

Lamps had to be lighted in Kingstown about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and
although the darkness was not intense before nightfall, the air was so full of falling
dust that the appearances resembled those of a very thick, dark city fog. During the
night the noises continued, but apparently no further showers of stones occurred.
The lightnings were very vivid and frequent ; the air warm, close, and stuffy. The
fine dust penetrated into every corner of the houses, and covered the furniture and
all the objects in the rooms with a grey film. It had also an irritating effect on the
nasal passage and respiratory organs, and on the conjunctiva, especially of those
persons who were obliged to be in the open air.
