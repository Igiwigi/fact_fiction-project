[70]. Likewise, HPV oropharyngeal cancers typically arise
from the highly specialized reticulated epithelium that lines
the tonsillar crypts [64,71]. This specialized epithelium is in
close contact with cells of the immune system, and is a
frequent site of replication for several viruses.

The basal layers of stratified epithelia contain both
slow-cycling stem-like cells, as well as proliferating transit-
amplifying (TA) cells. The TA cells can divide both symmetrically
(to generate more basal TA cells) and asymmetrically, where
one of the daughter cells proceeds through the differentiation
and tissue renewal process. Infection of a TA basal cell could
result in a short-lived infection. In fact, modelling the stochas-
tic dynamics of basal cells predicts that over 80% of infections
could spontaneously clear as infected cells mature [72].
Long-term, persistent infection most probably requires
infection of a slow-cycling stem cell. Moreover, infection of
these slow-cycling cells could promote latency [73].

The importance of the immune system in controlling HPV
infection is very evident in individuals with specific immuno-
deficiencies [74]. Individuals with EV, WHIM (warts,
