low-frequency magnetodynamics of AFM nanoparticles, suspended in a liquid, was studied on
the basis of a Fokker—Planck-type equation. Authors derived a simple expression for the energy of
AFM nanoparticle with a spontaneous magnetic moment and, most important, gave an example
of successful usage of the kinetic approach for description of magnetic response of nanosized
antiferromagnets.

Magnetization relaxation and nonlinear susceptibility of mechanically fixed AFM nanoparticles
were considered in [10-12]. The theory was based on the assumption that kinetics of the
decompensation magnetic moment obeys Brown’s equation [13] that, in essence, was justified
only for ferromagnetic single-domain particles. The proposed approach, on the one hand, seems
to open perspectives to apply to AFM nanoparticles all the power of methods elaborated for
uniformly magnetized ferromagnets. But, on the other hand, it does not make it possible to
consider the case of complete magnetic compensation. The fact is that it leads to a doubtful
conclusion that the magnetic relaxation time of an antiferromagnet turns to zero in the absence
of spontaneous magnetization. Thus, the role of the latter in the response of AFM nanoparticles
to an external field could hardly be clarified by this methodology. Meanwhile, such a study is in
demand, inter alia, due to prospects of usage of AFM nanoparticles in spintronic devices [14-16]
and nanomedicine [17-19]

The theory presented in this paper in a natural way includes the case of the totally
compensated sublattices. The proposed description, in its major part, is phenomenological; it
employs the Brown-type equation for the antiferromagnetic vector but treats it only as an
approximation valid at low enough frequencies. Within the developed framework both quasi-
static and non-equilibrium regimes of remagnetization of a uniaxial AFM nanoparticle, subjected
to an external field directed along the anisotropy axis, are studied.
