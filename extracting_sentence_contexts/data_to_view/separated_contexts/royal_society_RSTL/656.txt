These intestines
'Z remain empty during the sleeping season, 80 that no fat can
= be formed in that period.— With this very important informa-
> tion, thus procured, in support of my opinion, I have been led
F to prosecute this inquiry with increased ardour, and shall now
E bring forward the facts I have been able to ascertain in con-
5 firmation of my hypothesis. These I shall detail in the order
= in which they were acquired, thinking it better to lay before
S the Society the regular process of the investigation, than to
[E grasp at once at the conclusions, which in the end of it I have
8 felt myself authorized to draw. I shall therefore begin by stating the circumstances under
which adipocere is formed from animal matter, most nearly
resembling those in which the contents of the lower intestines
in living animals are placed ; and this I shall do from facts,



in the Intestines of living Animals. 149

entirely within my own knowledge, the specimens of the
adipocere being now in my possession ; and afterwards go
on by bringing forward proofs that a substance similar to it is
formed in the colon. Mary Howanp, aged forty-four, died on the 12th of May,
1790, and was buried in a grave ten feet deep at the east end
of Shoreditch church-yard, ten feet to the east of the great
common sewer, which runs north and south, and has always
a current of water in it, the usual level of which is eight feet
below the surface of the ground, and two feet above the level
of the coffins in the graves. In August, 1811, the body was
taken up with some others buried near it, for the purpose of
building a vault, and the flesh in all of them was completely
converted into adipocere or spermaceti.
