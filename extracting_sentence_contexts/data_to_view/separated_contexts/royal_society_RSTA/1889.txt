On the
other hand, if the noble gas Xe had, in the solid state, the low molar volume of Cu, it would be a
metal. The entire issue of the occurrence of metals and non-metals in the periodic table forms the
basis of the contribution in this volume of Yao ef al. [16]. It is salutary to note that Mendeleev
wrote ‘The preparation of metallic sodium by Humphrey Davy was one of the greatest discoveries in
chemistry’, reflecting the fact that this was the first example of a ‘light’ (ie. low density, large
molar volume) metallic element. Prior to this monumental discovery, the established elemental
metals were heavy, high density elements, such as Au, Hg and Pb. Thus, as Mendeleev noted,
‘... through it (Davy’s discovery) the conception of elements became broader and more correct’.
