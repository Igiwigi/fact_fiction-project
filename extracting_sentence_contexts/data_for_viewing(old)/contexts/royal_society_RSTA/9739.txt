It will be our object to choose p’ so that | (p—p’)’ dx is small, while at the same

time ¢’ can be expressed in terms of known functions, and, in fact, the interval (a, b)
will be divided into small sub-intervals in each of which p’ will be constant. Thus we
need the following lemma :—

If f (x) is a function limited and summable in (a,b) this interval can be so divided
into a finite number of sub-intervals, and a function (x) constant in each sub-

ch
interval can be so chosen that | (fx—px) dx is arbitrarily small.
