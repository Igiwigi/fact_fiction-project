frequency other than 2 from the variation computed from a whole lunation. The
phenomenon clearly suggests a solar action modifying a regular semi-diurnal lunar
variation. In the paper referred to, I have shown that the law according to which
the epochs of the several harmonic components change during a lunation is in accord-
ance with the theoretical consequences of such a solar action. While the proof of
this theorem might easily be stated in terms which imply no special hypothesis as to
the manner in which the action takes place, it was actually given in terms of a parti-
cular theory, viz., that the effect is due to a variation, periodic in a solar day, of the
electrical conductivity of the medium in which flow the currents to whose magnetic
potential is attributed the variable field put in evidence by the observations. The
dependence of the electrical conductivity upon solar time is accounted for if we
suppose that all or part of this conductivity is due to some ionizing influence from the
sun. So far as regards the facts thus mentioned, this assumption fits in naturally
with a view that the lunar magnetic variations arise from the lunar tide in the earth's
atmosphere? in the same way as, according to ScHusTER’s well-known theory, the solar
diurnal magnetic changes arise from the ordinary daily atmospheric motions} which
are indicated by the barometer.

In two important memoirs ScuusTER has proved that the solar-diurnal magnetic
