IFE lends itself to commercialization by the very nature of the separate components to a power
plant. Each of the four components could be a separate business proposition. In fact, the final two,

as well. There are major industrial companies already building and innovating in these sectors. Current IFE fusion companies are innovating in both the first and second categories.
