graphs taken simultaneously through two contrasting filters enables depths to be deter-
mined when absolute values of the extinction coefficients are not known.

The extinction coefficient (a-+-f), defined by the equation J = J,10-@*¢, is the sum of the
absorption coefficient a and the scattering coefficient ; both « and # vary with the wave-
length of the light used for their determination.

The absorption coefficient («) includes absorption due to the water molecules, and absorption
due to foreign matter in solution or suspension in the water.

In sea water the latter is generally small and may often be neglected, although it has been
claimed by Kalle (1938) that yellow colouring matter formed by organic processes is in fact
responsible for the green hue of coastal water; in lake water there is no doubt that matter in
solution contributes to the absorption coefficient (James & Birge 1938), but in normal coastal
or oceanic water this effect has not been observed in these trials.

Absorption within the visible spectrum due to the water molecules has been measured by
a number of workers, using both distilled water and specially purified sea water (Clarke &
James 1939; James & Birge 1938; Le Grand 1939; Sawyer 1931). Their results have been
discussed by James & Birge, whose own very exact measurements in a silver-lined tube have
been adopted, on the advice of Atkins, for the present work. James & -Birge’s values for
distilled water, smoothed and interpolated graphically by the writer, are given in table 1
and figure 2.
