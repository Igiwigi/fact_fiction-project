Visual acuity was tested again after the study. Study participants who consented to this were
contacted by telephone after a few weeks and asked about any follow-up symptoms.

(i) Aberrations

Since the SIO examination of the eye is performed through the pupil, one has to consider
the optical properties of the eye. These properties, as described in [14], are in many respects
significantly inferior to those of artificial optical systems. Because of these limitations, the first
fundamental question was whether structured illumination on a typical eye could be used to
produce an improved image compared to wide-field imaging. The reconstruction of SIM data is
usually based on the fact that the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system is known to
some extent. After separating the frequency-shifted orders of the image and correcting for the
frequency shift, an individual frequency weighting is applied to each order before summing the
orders. This weighting is based on the optical transfer function (OTF). However, since the PSF of
the eye is unknown, the frequency weighting is subject to a large error.

We therefore simulated the effect of reconstruction on the structured illuminated eye
background when the image frequencies are not weighted. For this purpose, a two-dimensional
strongly aberrated PSF was used and convolved with a known structure. A SIM simulation
and subsequent reconstruction without location-dependent weighting of the orders revealed that
structured illumination improved the resolution significantly even with strongly aberrated PSF
and without weighting correction.
