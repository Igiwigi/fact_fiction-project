SrrassMANN (No, 164) has attempted to show that menstruation and “heat” are

brought about by the increase of inter-ovarian pressure ; that the pressure exerted by
the growing Graafian follicle on the sensory nerve-endings in the ovary is the exciting
cause of the reflex action, which brings about congestion of the genital organs,
menstruation, or “ heat.”

Whilst this theory is not opposed to the fact that menstruation and ovulation are
quite distinct processes, since it does not presuppose that the Graafian follicle neces-
sarily ruptures, still it is in direct opposition to the fact that menstruation may
oceur after ovariotomy has been performed, and I do not find that SrrassMANN has
satisfactorily disposed of this objection to his theory.

Finally, I would draw attention to the fact that Soporra, in his admirable work
on the corpus luteum of the mouse (No, 14a), lays great stress upon the fact that the
increase in size of the wall of the newly-discharged follicle is due to the hypertrophy
of its cells, and not to the increase in number of those cells. This result is in
accord with the view I have independently arrived at, regarding the increase in size
of the wall of the newly-discharged follicles of M. rhesus, and has not been, as far as I
am aware, drawn attention to elsewhere,
