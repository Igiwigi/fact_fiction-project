and 7883”,493, or 2* 11' 2g”,6 and 2g",49, as the calculated
extent of the arc. But the arc observed was 2* 11' 19”,8g,
according to M. DELaMBRE, and 2* 11' 20”,85 according to
M. Mtxcnain; 5o that the least difference between the cal-
culation and the observations will be 2”,64. M. DeLamBre
| is of opinion, that the latitude of Dunkirk, which is 'sup-

Q posed to be z1* 2' 9,20, should be diminished ; and in fact
{I the distance between the parallels of Dunkirk and Green-
5 wich, which is 25244,9 toises, gives by the mean of the three
SE assumed ellipticities 26' g2”,g for the difference of latitude.
E After deducting this quantity from g1* 28' 40”, the supposed
b5 latitude of Greenwich, there remains 51* 2' 7”,7 or 8”, for
= that of the tower at Dunkirk. If from this again we deduct
Z the calculated arc 2? 11' 2g”,z, we have 48* zo' 44/',5 for the
S latitude of the Pantheon, while, according to the observations
S of M. DELAMBRE, it is 49,37, or 48',35 by those of M. Mr-
