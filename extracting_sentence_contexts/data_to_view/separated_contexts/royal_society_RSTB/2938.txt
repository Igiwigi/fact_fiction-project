If, however, the
water is passed slowly through a long length of stem, the viscosity of the liquid
which first issues may be from 4-6 per cent. higher than that of water. This is
however, a natural result of the solution in it of soluble materials gained from the
wood. The fact that slow lateral diffusion into or out of the surrounding more slowly
conducting tracheides is possible from the vessels, must have some effect upon the
rate of flow, but probably not a very great one. In any case, it is of interest to find
the relationship between the radii of the conducting vessels and the amount or rapidity
of flow. Section 6.â€”The Ratio between the Radii of the Vessels and the Rates of Flow.
