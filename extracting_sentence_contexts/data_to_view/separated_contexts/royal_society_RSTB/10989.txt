Moreover, during cancer
development, cells are exposed to altered extracellular con-
ditions which can include hypoxic, acidotic, mechanical and
nutrient deprived microenvironments, further stimulating the
cancer cell to engage highly conserved survival pathways
such as the HSR. Consistent with the knowledge that cancer
cells are exposed, both internally and externally, to major
