The equatorial regions appear to be particularly subject to
storms, violent rain, and electrical phenomena, the effect of
which, in diminishing the temperature, seems to afford a
natural explanation of the comparative coolness, both of the
atmosphere and the ocean, that we experienced each time we
passed the line.

The temperature of the sea, it has been asserted by some
writers, is Subject to little or no diurnal variation. That this
remark is far from correct, is evident from the slightest in-
spection of the. Meteorological Journal ; it is an opinion that
could, be formed only from hypothetical views, ill founded.
The fact, as the Journal exhibits, is, that the diurnal change
of the temperature of the sea is very nearly as great as that
of the incumbent atmosphere. From all the observations I
could make, when the circumstances were most favourable
to accurate results, when the weather was fine, the sea
smooth, and the land at a great distance, it appeared to me,

that the maximum temperature is about three in the after-
noon, and its minimum towards sunrise. I shall give a
single example in detail,
