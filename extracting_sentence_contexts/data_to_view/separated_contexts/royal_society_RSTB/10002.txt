Generalizing over
several hundred studies, there is clear evidence that the loss of biodiversity
from a certain trophic group of species results in their reduced biomass pro-
duction, associated with reduced efficiency of resource capture [1-3]. This
relationship has been primarily observed in communities of autotrophs such
as plants [4—7], but also holds in consumers of plant or animal resources
[8-10] and decomposers feeding on dead organic material [11,12]. In fact, the
loss of biodiversity across trophic levels has been predicted to show even stron-
ger effects owing to the strong connection between consumer-resource energy
fluxes and ecosystem processes [2,13,14]. The primary focus of BEF research has
been on bivariate relationships between biodiversity and a single ecosystem
process [1,4], but recent studies have provided strong evidence that the real
functional importance of biodiversity lies in maintaining multiple ecosystem
processes across environmental fluctuations in time or space [5,15]. The effects
of biodiversity loss are rapidly seen when multiple functions are monitored
