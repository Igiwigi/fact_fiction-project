According to him, insect gastrulation occurs in two
phases of which the first is represented by the separation of the primary yolk cells
(intravitelline separation), and the second by the inward migration of secondary
yolk cells from the primary epithelium (circumpolar separation). The differentia-
tion of the inner layer is not regarded as a part of gastrulation. Parren was also
of this opinion and says (1890, p. 368), ‘‘ That the median furrow of insects is merely
an ontogenic adaptation is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present
or absent in closely related forms”. According to this view, the yolk cells alone
represent the endoderm. But since they eventually degenerate, there is, among the
Pterygote insects, no true endoderm sharing in the formation of the adult body.
