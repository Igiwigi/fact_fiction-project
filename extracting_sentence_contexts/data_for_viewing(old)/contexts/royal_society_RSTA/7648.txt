the traces produced by the four shocks. A similar set of records and the corresponding
patterns are shown in figs. 7 and 8. This detailed similarity appears only when the
amplitude distribution for the shocks are also closely similar. We therefore conclude
that there are a number of active foci at which earthquakes recur comparatively
frequently. Each distinctive focus is designated by a Roman numeral, and this
numeral is given in the last column of Table I against the corresponding shocks.

9â€”LOGATION OF THE FOCI OF THE SHOCKS

In order to estimate the position of the foci from the amplitude distributions
produced by the different shocks it is necessary to make certain simplifying assump-
tions. The actual amplitude of the earth movements produced at a station as a result
of the passage of a given earthquake will depend in actual fact on a number of factors
of which it is difficult to estimate the influence. Such factors are the details of the
local and distant topography, the nature of the building on which the instrument is
mounted, the bearing of the wall on which the instrument is mounted relative to the
direction of the focus from the station, and other factors. As a first approximation
we assume that the amplitude recorded by the Jaggar shock recorders varies inversely
as the distance of the focus from the station and is independent of the other factors.

In the case of distant earthquakes the variation of amplitude with 1 /r can be regarded
as a roughly verified empirical rule. The question has been discussed theoretically by
a number of authors (LAMB 1904; JEFFREYS 1927, 1935), and it has been shown that
such a relation should hold only for a bodily wave undisturbed by discontinuities.
This relationship should be seriously affected by reflected waves. For a plane free
