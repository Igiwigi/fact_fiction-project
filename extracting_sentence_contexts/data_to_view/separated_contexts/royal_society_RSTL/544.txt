If for in-

d
Stance, we assume @ [2 ] to be equal to a W , we should find

the equation of the curve to be
y=(a+z2)c
c being the constant introduced by integration, and on sub-
$tituting this value of y in (a) we shall find c= o, 0 that
y=(a+a)o
Let us suppose a to be infinite and equal to, then we have
= (=+ 2) c=b += b, since c=0
which is the equation of a straight line parallel to the axis
of the »x's, which in fact agrees with the conditions of the

Problem. If we suppose 9 (2) = 4*= a constant quantity,
we should find

a= vVP=a
this value being substituted in (a) gives for determining c the
equation

(+1) =0
whence c=0 and c=+4/—1, using this latter value we have

a= =1 x VFIP=VD

which is the equation of the circle, and it is obvious, that this
curve satisfies the conditions,

It is very necessary to attend to this mode of determining
the constants, as we should otherwise meet in the solution
with many curves which do not satisfy the conditions ; thus
in the last example, the curve is apparently an hyperbola,
but owing to the constant becoming imaginary, it is in fact a
circle,


256 Mr. BaBBAGE'S essay, &c.

To complete the outline of this new method of calculation,
it would be necessary to treat of equations involving two or
more functional characteristics, and to explain methods of eli-
minating all but one of them: these lead to a variety of inte-
resting and difficult enquiries, and will probably be of consider-
able use in completing the solutions of partial differential equa-
tions: it would also be proper to consider the maxima and
minima of functions, and to apply to this subject the method
of variations ; these are points of considerable difficulty, and
although I have made some little progress in each of them, I
shall forbear for the present any farther discussion on this
subject. In the mean time, the sketch which I have offered,
and the few applications I have given, are sufficient to point
out the great importance of this method. It should however
be observed, that its applications have only been noticed inci-
dentally; my object has been to direct the attention of the
analyst to a new branch of the science, and to point out the
manner of treating it : the doctrine of functions is of s0 general
a nature, that it is applicable to every part of mathematical
enquiry, and seems eminently qualified to reduce itito one
regular and uniform system the diversified methods and
scattered artifices of the modern analysis; from its compre-
hensive nature, it is fitted for the systematic arrangement of
the science, and from the new and singular relations which
it expresses, it is admirably adapted for farther improvements
and discoveries.
