showed that composite materials comprising mixtures of tungsten carbides and borides were also
effective in enhancing neutron attenuation [8].

Despite recent progress in shield design, the maximum irradiation level that HTS tape can
accommodate without degrading is not yet known. In fact, a limited amount of irradiation
may be beneficial for tape performance. For example, in YBCO and GdBCO tapes irradiated
in the range 30-50°C, the critical current density increases marginally up to moderate neutron
fluences (of about 10??/m?), before degrading again at higher fluences [9-11]. The irradiation-
induced change in critical current is dependent on the operating temperature. For example, for
tapes irradiated to 2 x 10?*/m? an enhancement is seen at operating temperatures of 50K or
below, and a degradation at higher temperatures [9]. We note that this neutron fluence would
correspond to approximately 40h of continuous operation for a 32cm WC shield, as proposed
in [8], which predicted a fast neutron (E > 0.1 MeV) flux of approximately 1.4 x 10!” s-! m~? into
the superconducting core [8]. However, the accuracy of this prediction is questionable, as all the
studies were performed using fission reactor neutron sources [9-11]. Furthermore, the reactor
neutron energies (e.g. with peaks at around 0.1eV and 1MeV [11]) do not match those of a
typical fusion spectrum. Also, the irradiations were typically carried out above room temperature,
