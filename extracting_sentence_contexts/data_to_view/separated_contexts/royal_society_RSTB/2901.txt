The upper ends of the ascending filaments are united organically in longitudinal
series, and the upper edges of the ascending lamelle are free from adjacent parts. The interlamellar junctions are septa. In Lima fragilis they extend only one-twelfth
of the height of the demibranch ; in fact, as septa, they may be said to be absent, for
the junction practically represents the bend of the filament. In the other species
â€˜they extend up from one-fifth to one-third of the height of the demibranch. They
are, of course, confined to the principal filaments.
