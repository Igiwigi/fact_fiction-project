DR. E. B. WILSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENILLA. 735

This fact of extremely early variation is, T believe, one of great importance. Tt,

is evident that a structural variation in one of the segmentation spheres must

_ make itself felt, to a greater or less extent, in the structure and development of

* the cells derived from it, and may therefore appear ultimately as symmetrical or
correlated variations in the larva or adult organism,

Leptogorgia, like Renilla, is dicecious, and the eggs are fertilized in the water
after their discharge from the parent. The eggs are slightly smaller (-30 millim.),
d of a rosy tint, but are otherwise quite similar to those of PRenilla.
