of different conductivity from the liquid in mass, bounded by pellicles of
different conductivity from itself, and that when it becomes thin (about
300 y.p.), new forces (presumably surface forces) modify the conductivity in
a way which can be approximately represented by supposing that the con-
duetivity of the interior alone alters. We do not, however, at present wish to draw from these observations any but two
sonclusions —

a (1) The theory of the formation of a pellicle of different conductivity from the

a rest of the film will not by itself explain all the facts. 2 (2) Something in the nature of a discontinuity appears to occur at a thickness of
a about 100 p.u., which is but little greater than that which we have already
BS) fixed as the upper limit of the range of unstable thicknesses to which we
i attribute the discontinuity at the edge of the black part of a film. oD

3p On the whole, then, we think it most likely that the changes observed at the

‘gmaller thickness are in part at all events due to the direct action of the surface

‘Forces, but that their action is complicated by some cause which at greater thicknesses

a pellicle and also affects the interior of the film.
