tearing resistance of the skin is remarkable—it is essentially impervious to stress concentrations
(figure 4a) which is associated with the morphology and behaviour of the collagen [19].

The collagen fibres in the dermis layer display a disordered, curvy morphology; they have
a diameter of 5-10 1m and contain hundreds of approximately 50-nm diameter collagen fibrils
(figure 4b). Skin’s tear resistance can be directly attributed to the nano-/micro-scale behaviour
of this collagen, specifically to the synergistic activation of several principal deformation
mechanisms (figure 4c): the straightening of the individual collagen fibres within their initial
disordered network, stretching of these fibres, their rotation towards the force application
direction, their separation of the collagen fibres into fibrils and their stretching, sliding and
eventual breakage in the tensile loading direction [19].

In fact, the role of collagen fibrils varies significantly in different biological materials. We have
shown that in bone, stretching and sliding between collagen fibrils form the basis of plasticity
(figure 2); in certain fish scales, the Bouligand-type structure, with collagen fibrils oriented in
a twisted plywood formation, acts as a tough foundation to the highly mineralized surface to
provide resistance to both penetration and fracture [20]. In both these cases, the collagen fibrils
are mineralized and initially straight, whereas in the skin they are unmineralized, initially curvy
