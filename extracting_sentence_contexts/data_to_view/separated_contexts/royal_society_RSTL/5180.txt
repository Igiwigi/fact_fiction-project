, The, purple, powder is
placed, on, a, filter and, slightly washed with,cold water. On passing, carbonic; acid
through the filtered. liquid, the Jatter,loses,its, red colour, and a, yellowfloceulent
substance, is precipitated together with carbonate of baryta,, The liquid, after being
boiled in order to,decompose the, bicarbonate, of, baryta, and, then, filtered, is, evapo-
rated over $ulphuric acid at the ordinary temperature, when it, leaves a,$ubstance of
a light brown colour, which, resembles the sugar, produced by the action} of acids/on
rubian, but is not. quite,so, deliquescent.,,, This, substance, as I sball presently-show,
is in fact, a baryta, compound of sugar., The mixture of yellow flocks and carbonate
of baryta is now; added. to, the, purple, powder: before mentioned, and; the whole-is
treated with muriatic, acid jn order to extract, the baryta.,
