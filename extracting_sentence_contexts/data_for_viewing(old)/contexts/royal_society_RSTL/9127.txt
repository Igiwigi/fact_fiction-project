unit of hydrogen is not © distributed,” and is necessarily (unless we make totally un-
meaning assumptions) to be expressed by one prime factor «. If, therefore, we are to
depart from this principle some ground must be shown for 80 doing.

The comparative value of two hypotheses may be tested by following these hypotheses
out to their consequences, and comparing these consequences with the facts to which
the hypotheses are to be applied. If we find that one hypothesis is applicable to all
the facts, while the other is applicable to only a portion of those facts, the latter hypo-
thesis is inadmissible. But both hypotheses may include all the facts, and be equally
applicable to them, including in each case precisely the same facts. In this case both
hypotheses are equally tenable, and we haye no means of giving a preference to either.
But there is another case : both hypotheses may include all the facts, and s0 far either
may 8erve our purpose ; but one of the two may also do more than we want, covering
more ground than is required, and indicating improbable results. In this case that
hypothesis is to be preferred the consequences of which most exactly coincide with the
facts, namely, the more restricted hypothesis.

As8uming, then, that we are in possession of the symbols of the units of ponder-
able matter constructed, with logical precision, upon these two several hypotheses,
let us consider the consequences to be deduced from the expressions thus assigned to
them.
