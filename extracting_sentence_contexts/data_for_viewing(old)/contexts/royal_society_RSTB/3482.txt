blood constant is 2°04, while the average blood as percentage of body weight is 4°41.
In Table VI is calculated the blood volume from the average blood constants of the
groups (2°04), and from the average percentage (4°41) of the groups, and the
percentage deviation between the calculated and observed values in each case is also
given,

In the first case the deviation is only 0°53 per cent., whilst in the second it is
2:43 per cent. Here, as before, it is obvious that our formula represents the

experimental facts in a more satisfactory way than if the blood volume be calculated
as percentage of the body weight, as has hitherto been usual.
In Tables VII, VIII, IX, and X are detailed the results of our experiments upon
the blood volume of six wild rats, ranging in weight from 228 to 436 grms.
