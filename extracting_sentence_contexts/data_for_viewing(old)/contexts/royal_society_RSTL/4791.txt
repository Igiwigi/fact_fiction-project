as innumerable minnte and almost invisible granules. As we successively bring the
superior laminz into focus, we observe that the granules composing each layer be-
come progressively larger as we penetrate the scale. When isolated, they ordinarily
exhibit an obtusely fusiform contour, but as they grow in size they frequently become
confluent. The increase in their size is produced partly by the confluence of pre-
viously detached individuals, and still more generally by the addition of new layers
of calcareous matter round their exteriors. Indeed the latter process has apparently
been the direct cause of the former condition.

In fig. 10, three such layers are represented as they appear in the inverted scale :
10a is one of the lower series; Ã¾ is a layer of larger granules, some of which (6')
have become confluent ; and at c we observe a faint indication of a still higher series,
which when brought into view are found to have coalesced, forming in fact the inferior
surface of the middle tissue of the scale. This representation also shows, what T have
already alluded to, that whilst all the granules composing one layer exhibit a uniform
tendency to arrange themselves in one direction, those of different layers cross each
other more or less diagonally. Bearing in mind the arrangement of the primary fibres
of which these lamina? of membrane consist, it seems probable that the direction
of these fibres influences that of the calcareous granules.

As we proceed horizontally from the centre to the periphery of the scale, we find
a similar change to occur as when we pass from the upper to the lower layers. After
a certain time, the additions to the inferior surface of the calcareous layer almost
cease to be made in the centre of the scale; at all events, they do not continue to be
developed as rapidly as in an earlier stage of growth, and as they still are nearer the
