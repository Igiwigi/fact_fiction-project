The Bornean fish Gastromyzon is superficially not unlike the Silurian fish
Cephalasyis. This apparent similarity in structure or habits, which animals living under similar
conditions exhibit, is popularly known as “ convergence in evolution.” But recent
work on correlation between animal habitat and structure has brought out a number of
facts which are supposed to indicate that convergent evolution may occur in animals
living under totally different conditions : and vice versa, animals living under identical
conditions exhibit divergent characters. This is a misapprehension. Convergence is
the result of “independent functional adaptation to similar ends” (WriLtEy, 1911).
