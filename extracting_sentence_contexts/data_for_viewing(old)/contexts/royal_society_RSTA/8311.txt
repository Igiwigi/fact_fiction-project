the terms depending on the rotatory inertia

are taken into account. If the wall is assumed to be of height 1, length a, and breadth 6,
and, if further, the wind blows perpendicularly to its face and one principal axis lies
in the plane of vibration, then the frequency p of its gravest mode of vibrationst is
given by

p= (1 —2-3241 E)aee™ + (88)

* The duration of microseisms is in most cases longer than the duration of the average velocity of wind

above 20 miles per hour, and this is due to the fact that feeble microseisms appear even when the velocity
is lower than 20 miles per hour, and the tabulation has been made from the point where they became just
visible up to the point where they disappeared.

in which V is the velocity of progagation of longitudinal waves, depending only on the
material of which the building is made, K the radius of gyration of any transverse section
