It is the latter which will be principally increased at greater depths. Still it must not
be supposed that the mere increase of weight can explain the apparent difficulty already
suggested (art. 60), viz., Why, when the mass has been crushed and-then immediately
regealed under the existing conditions at any proposed point, it should again be crushed
at the same point. This 8cond crushing does not, in fact, take place under the same
pressure as that under which the regelation took place. This latter process occurs when
the pressure depending on the angular distortion of the element, or on the force F, has

been destroyed by the previous crushing ; and then the angular distortion, the force F,
and the increase of the maximum pressure are reproduced, and the mass is crushed again.
