Figure 5. Gross CO, emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI) over the twenty-first century ((a)
annual emission rates, (b) cumulated). Shown are results from 1.5°C and 2°C pathways derived from integrated assessment
models (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-2.6 from the AIM, IMAGE, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM and REMIND-MAgPIE models) and the
combination of all 320 sensitivity cases for final energy demand, electrification, and carbon intensities of electricity and non-
electric energy production. Coloured lines describe CO) budgets (reduced by an assumed 75 GtC0, land-use emissions from 2016
until the time land use ceases to be a CO, emissions source).

two are freely varied, we find a range of 570-810 GtCQ). Thus, breakthroughs in decarbonizing
non-electric energy use and radical energy demand reductions [52] have the largest potential to
deepen emissions reductions beyond what is projected in 1.5°C pathways in the literature. These
findings are due to the fact that aggressive power sector decarbonization is already foreseen in
these scenarios, and that the variation covered in the sensitivity analysis was small compared to
the other measures.

(b) CDR deployment and overshoot

To assess the implications of our sensitivity analysis for the question of overshooting 1.5°C, the
range of cumulative CO? emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes needs to
be related to the range of remaining CO2 emissions budgets for staying below 1.5°C discussed in
§2a. We assume that land-use CO? emissions after 2020 can be effectively limited to a cumulative
amount of 50 GtCO2, which is on the low end of values from the SSP-based 1.5°C pathways.
Assuming that during 2016-2020 another 25 Gt of CO? emissions will be emitted from land use,
our sensitivity analysis finds a range of 650-1680 Gt gross anthropogenic CO2 emissions during
