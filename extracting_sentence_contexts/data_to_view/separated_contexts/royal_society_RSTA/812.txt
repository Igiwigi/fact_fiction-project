We thus get the benefit of the large initial
gain close to the ground twice over, and the net gain is considerably greater than would
be obtained by raising either the transmitter or the receiver alone to a height hyp+hp. For a given value of hy +h, the optimum arrangement, if practical, is to make hy, = hp. It is here that the importance of the fictitious radius |r, | comes in. With both the
transmitter and receiver elevated it is necessary for the line joining them to clear the
fictitious sphere of radius | r, |, if the signals are to be unobstructed by the intervening
earth. This means, for instance, that on 10 m. the line joining them must clear the
surface of the earth by about 225 m., as will be seen from (5-15).
