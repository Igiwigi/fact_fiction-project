Wx(a, b) = si [ x(t" (=) dt, (2.1)

where x(t) is the signal in the time domain, « denotes the complex conjugate and y(t) is the
mother wavelet scaled by a factor a, a> 0, and dilated by a factor b. In the CWT, the time and
scale parameters (a,b) are continuous.

In many cases, the complex Morlet wavelet is preferred as the mother wavelet w(t) in (2.1),
given by Addison [3]:

WO= Te eee, (2.2)

where f, is a bandwidth parameter and f- is the wavelet centre frequency. In fact, the complex
Morlet wavelet is a Gaussian-windowed complex sinusoid; hence, its second-order exponential
decay results in optimal time localization during the wavelet transform. Additionally, the
complex Morlet wavelet function provides information about both amplitude and phase, and
it is better adapted for capturing coherence between harmonic frequencies [3].

(b) Third-order spectrum (TOS): bispectrum (BS)
The BS Bx(w1, 2) of a process {x(k)} is defined as [2]
By(w1, @2) = E{X(@1)X(w2)X*(1 + @2)}, (2.3)

where E is the expectation value, X(w;), i= 1,2, is the complex Fourier coefficient of the process
{x(k)} at frequencies w; and X*(wj) is its complex conjugate.
