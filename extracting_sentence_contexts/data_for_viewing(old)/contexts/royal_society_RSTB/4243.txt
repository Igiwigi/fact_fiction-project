independently developed exterior part of the ala temporalis is homologous with the
pars palatina of the palato-quadrate cartilage is correct, and no evidence has been
brought forward against this view, then the pterygoid of Ornithorhynchus develops
in close proximity to the palato-quadrate cartilage, as it should do. Even if this
view be not upheld by further discussion, we have the fact which I have pointed out
above, that in all the advanced Therapsids of South Africa, which we know, as surely
as we know anything in phylogeny, to be related to the ancestor of the mammals,
the pterygoids invariably cover the whole lower surface of the basipterygoid
processes, which are, of course, part of the neural cranium, Even in the living
Chelonia the pterygoids spread inwards under the lower surface of the basal plate.

The discovery of a new homology for the Echidna pterygoid presents no difficulty.
The fact that, according to ScHULMANN, a rudimentary muscle connects the Echidna
pterygoid of Ornithorhynchus with the sphenoidal and_petrosal region, shows, as
Gaupr has pointed out, that the bone was originally free. It must therefore, from
its general relations, be some bone belonging to the palato-quadrate series. If the
mammalian pterygoid be really the true reptilian pterygoid, it must be either the
ectopterygoid or the epipterygoid. Gavupp has shown that it is very improbable
that it is the ectopterygoid.

In both monotremes the “ Echidna pterygoid” develops as a membrane bone on
the ventral surface of the ala temporalis : in stage B of Ornithorhynchus it does not
extend at all lateral to this process. This fact affords some additional evidence that
the independently developed part of the ala temporalis is really homologous with
the pars palatina of the palato-quadrate of reptiles; for no one will deny that this
