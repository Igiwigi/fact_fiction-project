nearly all can survive six hours or less. There is no critical period of exposure, about
half the puparia surviving a 12 hours’ submergence.

(2) There is apparently no important difference between tachinoides and
submorsitans.

(3) The age of tachinoides puparia has an important effect on survival, 18 out of
19 puparia about 15 days old surviving under conditions which killed all of seven
puparia 0 — 5 days old. In experiments by Nasu (1933a, p. 114) on submergence of
Glossina morsitans puparia in water, it was found that ‘‘ a submergence of up to four
days is not fatal to tsetse puparia ; above four days it is fatal in every instance.”
Probably the mortality of our puparia with shorter exposures is partly due to the
fact that they were only 0 — 5 days old at the time of exposure.

(4) Exposures in sterilized soil for 24 hours and 12 hours, and in distilled water
for 24 hours, indicate a slightly higher survival under nearly sterile conditions, but
