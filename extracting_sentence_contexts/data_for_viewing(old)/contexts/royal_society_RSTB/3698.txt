My own investigations (18, 20) on this subject were published in 1899 and in 1900,
and in these I considered the question of restoration of the nerve paths after division
and reunion of nerves, and also the subject of restoration of function after nerve
crossing in the fore limb of the dog.

Brerae (31) and Laneiry and ANDERSON (38) followed, the latter dealing with
the subject of functional union between crossed nerves of the same and of different
functions, and coming to the conclusion, among others, that the “central end of an
efferent fibre can make functional connection with the peripheral end of any other
efferent fibre of the same class, whatever be the normal action produced by the two
nerve fibres.”

Within the last ten years these physiological facts have come to be more applied in
surgical work, with varying success, and it appeared to me that many points from
the physiological standpoint still required investigation in connection with these
practical applications of the work. In the past two years I have performed about
thirty experiments in dogs and monkeys, and, as these experiments fall naturally into
three groups, I propose to publish them in three parts. The first will deal with the
methods of cross union between a peripheral segment of a divided facial nerve with
the nerves in the neighbourhood which may be chosen as substitutes for the central
end of the facial; and in this part will appear a report, nearly twelve years after
operation, of the case of spino-facial anastomosis which was published in the
‘Philosophical Transactions’ in 1901. The second part will take up experiments
in the nerves of the fore limb in dogs in extension of my experimental work published
in 1901. The third part will consist of experiments on the anastomosis of nerves in
