fear produce the same effect suddenly: whilst the contrary
feelings, such as the prospect of immediate enjoyment, or
moderate hilarity, give more than ordinary vigour.

It is a very remarkable fact in the history of animal nature,
that the mental operations may become almost automatic, and,
under such habit, be kept in action, without any interval of
rest, far beyond the time which the: ordinary state of health
permits, as in'the examples of certain maniacs, who are enabled
without any inconvenience, to exert both mind and body for
many days incessantly. The habits of particular modes of labour
and exercise are s00N acquired, after which, the actions become
automatic, demand little attention, cease to be irksome, and are-
effected with little fatigue : by this happy provision of nature,
the habit of industry becomes a source of pleasure, and the
same appears to be extended to the docile animals which co-
operate with man in his labours.
