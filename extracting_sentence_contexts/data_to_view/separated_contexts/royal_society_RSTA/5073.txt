Nonlinearities only arise in this loading, and the structure reacts
linearly to it. This can be used to advantage, e.g. using the impulse-response formalism to
significantly speed up the analysis [3]. In fact, the structural model of the support structure
can be understood as a system of coupled damped oscillators that are driven by external
forces. The simplification this allows is a major motivation for decoupling the rotor from the
support structure. Rotor load models is the generic name for a class of models that provide time series of forces,
or moments, at an interface node (typically the tower top), in approximation of the true rotor :
loads that one would obtain from a more comprehensive rotor simulation.
