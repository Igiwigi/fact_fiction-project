on them are unable to generate and maintain the heat at a level sufficiently above that of
the surrounding atmosphere to give rise to favourable conditions for continued development.

If this is generally true, then a further restriction of the available carrion, through the un-
suitability of certain kinds of carcasses, occurs during the winter months. This conclusion
cannot be applied to South African conditions without due allowance being made for
climatic differences between this country and America. Such a restriction, if it takes place
at all, must be limited to a comparatively brief period during the Karroo winter. It is
non-existent in the warmer areas of the country. It may provide a partial explanation of
the fact that, in the Karroo, the population of Lucilia is sometimes lower than might be
expected from its obvious advantages over other species.

Since it touches the question of carcass suitability, the observation of Fuller regarding the
apparent predilection of certain species of flies for the carcasses of certain kinds of animals,
quoted earlier, also belongs here if confirmed. Such a deliberate exercise of choice would
no doubt be ascribed to some suitable factor.

4. Balance of species

The number of eggs deposited on a carcass by each species of blowfly at any one time will
obviously depend to a great extent upon the abundance of that species. This, apparently, is
not the whole of the story. Mackerras & Mackerras (1944) emphasize the importance of the
