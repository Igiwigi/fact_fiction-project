Thus, if the assumptions made on p. 7 are satisfied for any particular value of r
less than p, they are satisfied for a value of 7 one greater than that value.

For 7 = 1 the statements have been justified, and it follows therefore that 6',,,...0;
are all determined uniquely without the knowledge of «,’, x,'... from the first ( ptl)
.of the equations X, and by the same equations a...@, are found, except for their first
elements, the expressions obtained containing those first elements.

5. Consider now the (p+2)™ equation X in regard to its first element.

As before, this will be independent of «,'....'; but on account of the extra term
arising from dy/dt, which now enters for the first time, the coefficient of x,' is not
zero. It is, in fact, —1.

Thus, the quantities 0,'...,., beimg now known, this equation gives 2,'.

Similarly, the next group’s first member will contain the term —2z,' but will not
contain «,'...2',4,, and will therefore give a,' after a,’ is found.

Thus all the elements «,’ are determined successively, and returning to the
expressions for a,"(7>1) in terms of these and substituting the values so found, all
these are given also.

The equations for the columns y, z, &c., being treated in the same way, give the
corresponding @’s uniquely, and also the coefficients in the series of which these
