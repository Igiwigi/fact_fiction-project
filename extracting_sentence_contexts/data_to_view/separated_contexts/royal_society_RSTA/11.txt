They are canonical brain areas associated with aes
sympathetic regulation [43]. Other regions showing significant associations in the current analysis 22
have been reported to be related to autonomic activity in previous studies [43]. In fact, the insular : 8
cortex is posited to act as an integrator on the brain-heart axis [48]: it has a prominent role in : ~
limbic-autonomic integration and is involved in the perception of emotional significance [49]; it :B
also participates in visceral motor regulation, including blood pressure control, in cooperation 73

with subcortical autonomic centres [50-52]. The dACC is also involved in autonomic control
[30,53]; the network consisting of insula, ACC and amygdala has been described as crucial in the
regulation of central ANS [54]. A human neuroimaging meta-analysis on electrodermal activity
and high-frequency HRV revealed that midbrain, insula and supramarginal gyrus are associated
with sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation; ACC, thalamus and primary somatosensory
cortex are associated with sympathetic regulation, whereas precuneus, superior temporal gyri
and angular are associated with parasympathetic regulations [43].
