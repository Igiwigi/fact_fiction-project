appears comparatively early, as in some, at least, of the Abietines, where it comes in
with or before the secondary wood. Its tardy development in the stem may be
in association with the foliage habit, and it will be interesting to determine its
relationship to the primitively persistent foliage of the Araucarineze, the leaf bases
in some forms of which remain on the stem for many years, and, as was stated before,
form an “ armour” quite comparable to that of the Cycads.

The presence or absence of annual rings in the Araucarinez has been a matter of
much dispute. This has resulted from individual variation and possibly also from
the fact that in some forms the rings are clearly marked, while in others there is
a ringed appearance to the naked eye, which on examination with the microscope in
transverse section is not evident. It was this which led ScHacur (1862) to state
that there are no (his own italics) annual rings in Araucaria brasiliensis, but only
an appearance of concentric circles. He says, further, that the circles are incomplete
and that in the radial direction also the rings “are lost gradually either on both sides
or on one side, and frequently, indeed, this is the outer side, whereas in true annual
rings, at least in the stem, the transition from spring to summer wood is the more
gradual.” The trunk material which Scuacur examined came from Brazil. WINKLER
(1872) confirms the absence of annual rings in greenhouse material of the same
species ; the tree was thirty years old but showed only eighteen rings. He does not,
however, agree with Scuacuy as to the rings themselves, but considers that they
show very good alternations of smaller thicker-walled cells and larger thinner-walled
