I. Growth.—It may be said that in general the majority of the species of Penicillium
investigated grow reasonably well on the medium used and under the cultural con-
ditions followed. An outstanding exception is P. digitatwm Saccarpo, which only
begins to show signs of germination on this medium after two to three weeks’ incubation
but, having once germinated, growth is ultimately quite good. This was found to be
the case for three different strains of this species and confirms the observation, previously
made by Txom, that P. digitatum can only use sodium nitrate as a source of nitrogen
with considerable difficulty.

II. Carbon in Sulphuric Acid Bubbler.—The class of carbon compounds included under
this heading consists of any very volatile organic substance which is absorbed by
concentrated sulphuric acid. It is a well-known fact that many species of Penicillium

under certain cultural conditions have very marked odours, but, under the cultural
conditions followed in this paper, only one species of Penicillium, P. digitatum, gives
rise to any marked amount of bodies of this type. The substance responsible has been
identified as ethyl acetate and has been shown to be produced by each of the three
