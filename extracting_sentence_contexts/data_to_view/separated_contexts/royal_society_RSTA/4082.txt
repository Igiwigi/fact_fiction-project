An impressive time compression is observed, since the time-reversed
wave field at the focal point lasts about 11s compared with 200 1s. Besides, the typical spatial
dimension of the focus obtained through the scattering sample is an order of magnitude lower
than that measured in water (free space) as can be seen in figure 2b. This super-focusing result can
be explained by the fact that the diffusive medium acts as a lens. When the scattering medium
is inserted between the source and the focus, the waves emitted from the source diffuse. The
diffusive halo acts as an array of Huygens secondary sources at the exit of the complex medium,
along the interface that faces the focus.
