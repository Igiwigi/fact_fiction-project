It can be expressed in closed form by unique factorization in Fy[x]

P neF,[x], monic r=0
deg n>=0

The second equality follows from unique factorization, the third equality gathers n’s according to
their degree (there are q” monic polynomials of degree r in F,[x]), and the last equality is the sum
of the stated geometric series. Letting
Lx) =[]a-xMPIyt= YS xoin, (1.10)
P neF,[x] monic
deg n=0

one can collect together the terms 1 of given degree and get

Artin used quadratic reciprocity to show that

Yo xn) =0, fred, (1.12)
nmonic
deg n=r
so that L(s, xp) is a polynomial in q~* of degree < d — 1, and in fact of degree d — 1 by means of
the functional equation, also proved by Artin, described below. To prove (1.12), one can use the fact that the sum of (n|D) over a complete set of residue classes
n modulo D is 0. Note that on applying quadratic reciprocity, each xp(n) = +(n|D). For fixed D
and fixed degn, with n monic, each application of quadratic reciprocity has, by (1.5), the same
+1 factor.
