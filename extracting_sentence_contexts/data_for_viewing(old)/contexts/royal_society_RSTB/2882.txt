has no basal cell, and the suspensor is present. In face of these facts the position of
the Ophioglossaceze requires reconsideration.

It is necessary to note that Cerakovsky’s thesis does not specify the genus
Lycopodium, nor even the homosporous forms, but simply the “ Lycopods,” a term
which then included the Psilotaceze and also the heterosporous Jsoetes ; on the other
hand, it leaves out of account the Sphenophyllez as being an extinct group. But
these all take their place between the homosporous Lycopods and the Ophioglossacew,
in our present view, on grounds of comparison of the sporophyte. The details of the
gametophyte of the Psilotacese and Sphenophyllez are unfortunately not available for
comparison,” so that we are thrown back for comparison of the sexual generation upon
Tsoetes only, a genus which, on grounds of its heterospory, some may be disposed to
discount.f It is a remarkable fact that two of the Filicineous characters above
