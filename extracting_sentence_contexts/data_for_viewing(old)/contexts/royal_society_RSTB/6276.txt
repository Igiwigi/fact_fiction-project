better developed and the luteal cells did not appear so plump as in the larger ones ;
than which they appeared to be slightly older in consequence. It is clear that
either (a) all the corpora lutea formed a single set resulting from a single ovulation
or (b) that they formed two sets of 3 + 4 and 5 + 5 respectively, resulting from two
consecutive ovulations. The first alternative is supported by the fact that ten
embryos and one degenerating ovum were present in the uterus. Even if it were
assumed that the embryos were derived from the ten ova presumably liberated at
the second ovulation the degenerating ovum could only be accounted for by assuming
its persistence from the previous ovulation. Moreover, no other animal was
obtained with more than one recent set of corpora lutea. The second alternative is
supported by the histological differences in the corpora lutea, but these might
possibly have been caused by the overcrowding resulting from the presence of so
large a number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was obtained with
more than 12 corpora lutea in a set supports this alternative. The second alternative
postulates that the first ovulation, which may or may not have been preceded by
copulation, did not result in pregnancy and was followed by a second which did ;
the interval between the two being sufficiently short to allow of the persistence of the
first set of corpora lutea and one of the ova. It is impossible on the evidence to
decide which hypothesis is true, but in either case the animal is so exceptional that
it is probable that it was functionally abnormal.

Part of this investigation was carried out during the summer of 1932 at the National
Institute for Medical Research through the courtesy of the Medical Research Council
and Sir Henry Date, Sec. R.S. The author is greatly indebted to them for the
