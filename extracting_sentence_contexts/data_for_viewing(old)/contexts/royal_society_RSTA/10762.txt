9. Limit to the Height of a Planet's Atmosphere.

Tt is obvious, on the non-kinetic view, that no matter could be retained in relative
equilibrium beyond the distance at which a planet's attraction is just balanced by

centrifugal force. On the kinetic theory, this limitation finds its interpretation in
the fact that the density of the atmosphere according to the above law of distribution
is proportional to

exp — hm{V — 40°(€? + 7°)} = exp — hm{V — 40?r°} where 1 = € + 7°. . (19).

If dV/dr > 0%r, the density decreases as we proceed outwards from the axis of
the planet, it becomes a minimum when dV/dr = 0%, and begins to increase again
outwards when dV/dr < Q’r, Hence the point at which centrifugal force is just
balanced by the planet's attraction is the point of minimum density in the atmo-
sphere according to the above law of permanent distribution. And since the
atmosphere does not extend to infinity, we conclude that it cannot be permanent
unless the density at the point of minimum density is iifinitesimal, and practically
zero.
