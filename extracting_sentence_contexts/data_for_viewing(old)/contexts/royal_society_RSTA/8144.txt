(50) entering the tables of the y* integral with 5 degrees of freedom, find that 4) =
15-086. Hence from (51),

\ h=2, (co, = 259), P, (Yb S %o) = 0-42
ifh = 3, (0, = 369), Pi (v S bo) = 0-11.

(b) On the other hand, if the variance, s*, is used as criterion, we must put f= 4
in (46) and find that }) = 13-277. Hence

{ h=2, (co, = 205), P, (bv S bo) = 0°49
ifh=3, (0, = 309), Pi (b So) = 0-17.

In fact for h = 2, 3 or any other value, it is found that the second test has less power
of discrimination between the false and the true than the test associated with the
best critical region.

Example (3).—The admissible hypotheses are given by (33), both a and o being in this
case unspecified. We have to test the simple hypothesis Ho, that a = do, o =o.
The best critical region with regard to a single alternative H,, with a= 4,,o =o,
will be defined by
