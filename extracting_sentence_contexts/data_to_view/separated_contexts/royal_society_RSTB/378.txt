The results produced after the larvae had been covered for the whole of Stage III.
(i.e. 1, 2, &c.) are all the same, the position of the gilt chamber making no difference,
while in those covered for a shorter time the difference is very great, the two pupa in
the tubes with the gilt chamber above being very dark, and supplying the only
instance of a (2) in the whole of the experiments with compartmented tubes. It is
probable, in fact nearly certain, that the darkness of these two pupe is at any rate
partially due to individual tendencies or to influences which acted before the larve
were covered. There are no evidences of any colour-relation between the free pup
and the neighbouring tubes,

far too much for the greater illumination of the upper chamber. The results of the
