cartilages are but slightly affected, and the main differences from the normal indicate
only that pressure or compression is at that time preventing the cartilage from
developing (e.g., absence of tegmen cranii). The principal changes in the skull
develop in the third and fourth stages (e.g., lateral ethmoids, frontals, subocular
ligament), when the lower tension is causing the rupture of the hyocleithral con-
nection, that is, when there is an increasing difficulty in opening the jaws, as
mentioned above. At this period the two tensions are operating together on the
skull anteriorly, and this appears to be the essential, determining factor in the
divergence of the Flat-fish skull from the normal. The subocular ligament, which
develops in the tissues outside the skull, on one side only or on both sides (Solea),
between the palatine-lateral ethmoid anteriorly and cranium posteriorly, may be
regarded as a product of the tension. And the magnitude of the tension may be
judged from the fact that the skull suffers deformation under it even when strongly
ossified (e.g., Bothus).

The principal changes in the skull and arches can thus be referred to the ventral
mechanism of the head; the latter is more or less asymmetrical from the beginning,
z.e., when the structures are forming, and its ‘asymmetry must be derived from some
condition in the body. The asymmetries in the posterior region of the skull can
also be referred to the conditions in the body, that is, this part of the skull is under
the influence of tensions operating on the dorsal fin and superior pharyngeals
(ef., ante p. 87).

In the abdominal region the oblique growth of structures is also due to tensions
in most cases, ¢.g., flexure to one side of the neural and heemal spines, dorsal and
