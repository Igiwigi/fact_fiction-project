often necessarily different, especially when dealing with
distant-related species. For instance, even though the use of
training procedures in fish permits the employment of the
same visual arrays adopted in primates, the comparison
remains problematic. Small differences in procedure can
greatly affect the performance in a numerical task, even
within the same species [93]; hence, methodological variability
must be taken into account in comparative studies. Even when
animals are tested in identical conditions, other concurrent fac-
tors intrinsically related to the tested species may prevent a
reliable comparison. Comparing monkeys and dogs in a com-
puter task with visual stimuli, for example, may be affected by
the fact that dogs are typically less reliant on vision than pri-
mates. Interspecific differences in personality and motivation
can also be critical factors when comparing different species
in the same task. For example, the different metabolic require-
ments of warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates could have
significant effects on motivation and, therefore, affect perform-
ance in both food quantity discrimination tests and training
experiments that use food as a reward. These problems can
be, to some extent, overcome using multiple tests for assessing
the cognitive abilities of the species that are being compared
[94,95]. Notwithstanding the inherent limits of interspecific
comparison highlighted above, studies comparing humans
and fish suggest that similarities are greater than differences,
