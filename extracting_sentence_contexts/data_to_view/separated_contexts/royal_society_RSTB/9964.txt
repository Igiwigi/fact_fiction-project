Rather,
the purpose is to use the concept of evolutionary transitions
to explore the tempo and mode of the changes that led to
humans as a uniquely unique species. In the first part, I will discuss different levels of evolution-
ary change, and introduce a four-part classification. The
distinction between normal and transitional evolution is an
oversimplification, and there are in fact a scaled series of
types of change in evolution that will be described. In the
second, I consider the evidence for these in human evolution,
and when they may have occurred. Finally, I will look at the
overall evidence in terms of the tempo and mode of human
evolution, and the nature of its causes.
