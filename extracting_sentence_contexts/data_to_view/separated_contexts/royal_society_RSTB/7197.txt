THE EFFECT OF ANGLE WITH THE HORIZONTAL

line direction distance (m.) cone units minutes of arc
vertical 8:3 3-62 2-50

The results shown in table 37 were given by a grating of yellow and blue lines, 6 mm.
wide. The differences shown are just outside the experimental error, so that there seems
to be some factor causing colour to be eliminated at a somewhat greater visual angle when
the lines slope down to the right than when they slope down to the left. It is possible that
this difference is associated with the fact that in the observer’s left eye, which was used for
the above tests, the optical axis meets the retina at a point below and to the left of the
fixation points for the different coloured rays. This point will be referred to again in
Part VII. Another curious effect was noticed while the above tests were in progress, namely, that
with oblique lines the image broke down to produce spurious images much more readily
than was the case either with horizontal or vertical lines.
