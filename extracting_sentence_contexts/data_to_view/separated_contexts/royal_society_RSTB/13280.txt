As regards Hyriopsis
cumingii, a peculiar miRNA (Hcu-Mir-4504) participates in
the regulation of pigment biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the bind-
ing of sucha miRNA to the melanocyte inducing transcription
factor (HeMITF) can impair melanin production. In fact, MITF
regulates genes involved in melanin biogenesis, interacting via
a typical basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH Zip) to

sequencing is often based on stem-loop RT-qPCR or on the
dual-luciferase assay, the latter aimed at verifying the
miRNA interactions with their putative target genes. Below,
we provide a comparative overview of the bivalve miRNA
functions investigated so far (figure 3). Specific miRNAs
have been demonstrated to play a role during the immune
response of C. gigas against Vibrio splendidus.
