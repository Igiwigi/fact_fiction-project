per unit of area of the plate be considered, it seems true that the members of the
1st sub-series lines @ and c, Plate 1, have diminished in intensity relatively to the
other two silver lines. Though if the whole intensity of the radiation in the region
of the plate occupied by the broadened lines be considered, the relative strengths of
the lines are very difficult to determine.

Under pressure, all the lines in this part of the spectrum become obliterated. It
may be here remarked that the complete obliteration recorded by the photographs
with the large Rowland grating are not entirely confirmed by photographs with a
1 m. grating. These latter sometimes show faint indications of lines under high
pressures where none are apparent in those taken by the 21} feet instrument. This
is due to the fact that the lines do appear in the spectrum under pressure at the
moment of extinction of the arc, and possibly at the moment of striking it
(cf: p. 44).

With large dispersion the duration of these lines is insignificant compared with the
total length of exposure necessary to affect the plate, but when the dispersion is
smaller the exposure is less, and the interval during which the lines shine out is
comparable with the total exposure necessary.

The lines to vanish first are those of the 1st subordinate series (a, \ = 4055°44
and ¢, \ = 4212°1), which are of great intensity at normal pressure. In this respect,
and also because they become dissipated before they are obliterated, their behaviour
is very similar to the 1st subordinate series lines in the corresponding region of the
