‘ Mittheilungen a. d. K. Gesundheitsamte,’ vol. 2, p. 421). The death-rates both in
Dundee and Buda-Pesth are in consistence with this hypothesis,

The curious relation in the death-rate from phthisis appears to depend on the
mutual interaction of constitutional predisposition and bad hygienic conditions. The
mere fact that, the worse the hygienic conditions, the more do children who are
weakly die off in childhood, does not altogether account for the differences in the
death-rate from phthisis. For, in spite of this survival of the fittest, the general
death-rate above 20 increases steadily from the better to the worse houses
(including Infirmary and Poor-houses), although the increase is nothing like so great
as it is for children, Were phthisis due merely to the influence of bad hygienic
conditions, we should, therefore, still expect the death-rate to increase up to the two-
and one-roomed houses. As a matter of fact, although those under good hygienic
conditions suffer by far the least from phthisis, yet it tells most heavily on those
under only moderately bad hygienic conditions, and this is the case even when all the
deaths in the Infirmary and Poor-houses are set down against those under the worst
hygienic conditions, 7.e., those in the one- and two-roomed houses. This would seem
to indicate a predisposition to tubercular disease in a certain proportion of the
individuals, quite apart from general constitutional weakness. Under good hygienic
conditions the great majority of these will escape altogether. Under medium con-
ditions a large proportion will survive the tubercular diseases of childhood, but only
to fall victims to phthisis later on in life. Under the worst conditions most will die
of tubercular disease during childhood. So few will survive that, although a larger
proportion of them will die than of the survivors under medium conditions, yet the
death-rate from phthisis on the whole population in the worst houses will be less.
