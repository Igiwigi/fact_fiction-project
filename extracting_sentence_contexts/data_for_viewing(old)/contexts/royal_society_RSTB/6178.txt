successfully imposed. ‘Consequently, in the present instance, we have no need to
go beyond the labyrinth in searching for the cause of the inevitable, final reversion
to asymmetry. It is a displacement of the head, whether of passive or of physio-
Jogical origin, that conditions a labyrinthine reflex, with, as its effector result, assump-
tion of spinal torque. As a corollary to this conclusion we also infer that, so long as
the head remains motionless, no labyrinthine reflex and no labyrinthine excitation
occurs.

Before we leave the Berrrorr experiment, one other remark may be made. By
his finger manipulation Berrrorr brought the posture of the unilaterally delabyrin-
thized animal back merely to symmetry. By the same means as it can be undone,
the original asymmetry can be over-corrected, and the frog will then retain for a time
a posture in which it actually leans to the intact side. This striking fact provides
further evidence that, when once the labyrinth has settled to rest, it ceases to signal.

Receptors for the Gravity Reactions

If a frog is both delabyrinthized and blinded, it gives no invariable reaction to
gradual tilting of the surface on which it rests. Usually, at some high inclination of
the substratum, it merely falls off, without having made any previous movement.
Should it have been incited to move, its new skeletal adjustment is as often inappro-
priate as not. If the frog is delabyrinthized without having been blinded, it does,
at high angles of inclination, carry out truly compensatory adjustments. If the
