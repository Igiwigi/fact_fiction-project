in excess of those in the earlier table. This means that the
amplitude of magnetic disturbance is in general more enhanced relatively in years of
sun-spot maximum than is that of the regular diurnal inequality. The great rise in
b/a as we pass from the mean daily to the mean monthly range in Table VII. is
evidence of the same fact. That this rise in b/a is not continued, except in H, as we
pass from the mean monthly to the annual range, is at least consistent with the view
that the incidence of exceptionally large magnetic storms is determined by causes of
which sun-spot frequency is no exact measure. ยง 15.
