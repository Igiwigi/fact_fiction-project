80%. After a very few turns of the re-
volving plate, the doubler became electrified negatively : I
immediately set the door and windows wide open, and another
door which opens over a bow window, to let in fresh air ; but
the wind blowing moderately strong from the east, and the
bow window door being at the north end, and the windows at
the south end of the garret, made it unfavourable for an east
wind to drive through it, therefore its electric state remained
the same in kind after they had been opened, as when $hut;
for I examined it at several intervals.of time : yet the state
of the air became thereby considerably better to breathe in. These facts will appear still more extraordinary, wien we
consider that the general state of atmospheric electricity at
the time of performing these experiments was of the po-
sitive kind, as appeared ty the doub er when placed on the
wood hand-rail of the bow window, which is cn y three

feet and six inches out of the garret. Had the direction of the
wind been north or south, it would have passed through the
garret with force, and would, no doubt, have changed by re-
gular gradation its electricity to positive; a fact that I have
often observed to succeed very quickly. I likewise observed, that when the excessive heat of the sun
was full upon any other room in my house, it was capable of

x effecting a change in their electrical state, excepting in those
A which were under ground ; for in the two kitchens, open area,
# and coal-vault, the doubler became electrified positively; in
S the two former rooms speedily, but in the two latter, that lay
E more to the sun, slowly.
