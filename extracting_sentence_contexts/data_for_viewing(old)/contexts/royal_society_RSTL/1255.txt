mon water,*

Acsingular consequence to be drawn from-these experiments
seems to be, that, since sea water does not begin to expand
till it has been cooled below the point at which it usually
freezes, if its congelation were not retarded, it would become
solid - without undergoing any previous expansion, and the
law in question would altogether cease to exist in the case
of ea water. Ã¾

With regard to the singular anomalies of temperature
inthe Arctic seas, which have given rise to this digression,
though some of the facts in question may now be more easily
understood, it would be premature, until the observations
have been multiplied, and the facts themselves more accu-
rately investigated, to attempt to bring them under any

* The ice thus produced, it should be remembered, is very different from that
which forms on the $urface of the ea, since the latter parts with its salt in the act
of freezing, a separation which can but very imperfectly take place in confined ves-
sels. Accordingly 1 found the ice produced in this experiment soft and compressible
like the water-ice of confectioners.

With regard to the quantity of expansion which sea water undergoes, in confined
vessels, at the moment of freezing, I have been able to estimate it with ease, and with
