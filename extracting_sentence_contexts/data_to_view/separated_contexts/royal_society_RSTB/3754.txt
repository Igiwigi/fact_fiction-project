All the Conifer series have spirally
arranged primordial leaves with a free lamina. These primordial leaves have a more
primitive organisation than the adult foliage.t They persist in the pines for a year
or more (in Pinus canariensis for many years), and can even be recalled in the
adult in many forms by wounding (Pinus rigida, etc.). Strikingly in contrast
to this is the fact that in none of the other Conifer forms does wounding revive
a spur shoot. The spur shoot of the pines must thus be considered of a cenogenetic
character. That of Woodworthia of the Triassic, which is very persistent and bears
many leaves, is clearly of a primitive typeâ€”might well be that of an Araucarian in
the initial stage of this branch specialisation, a specialisation which, together with its
