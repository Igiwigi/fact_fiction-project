known in many parts of the country as the Ginger-beer Plant, from its association
with the domestic manufacture of the well-known summer beverage so often pur-

put up in brown stone bottles, with tied corks. My earliest specimens of the Ginger-

then Professor of Botany in the University of Oxford, who exhibited specimens at a
meeting of the Linnean Society in 1887.* Since then I have obtained specimens
from various sources in this country and abroad; and during the progress of a long
series of investigations have elicitated a number of facts as to the constitution and

obtained from Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, and even from North America, I have also

for specimens from the towns referred to, and Messrs.
