offspring the characteristic of a great arm length which it itself possesses, but one
would expect in this case that the other characteristics, namely of a triple arm
skeleton with cross rods, would also be transmitted. There was as a matter of fact
a short anal arm skeleton in a few of these hybrids, though this was not so frequent
as in the hybrids obtained in Exp. 65. Of the other abnormal characteristics, perhaps the most obvious was a slight
thickening of the calcareous skeleton, which was present in a considerable number of
the hybrids, It would be quite impossible, however, to diagnose hybrids from pure
Strongylocentrotus larvee by means of this characteristic, as there is a considerable

5 amount of variation in this respect even in these latter. Again, there was a tendency
i for the lower club-shaped end of the body skeleton to branch and split up, but this

was very much less frequent and less marked than in the reciprocally crossed hybrids.
