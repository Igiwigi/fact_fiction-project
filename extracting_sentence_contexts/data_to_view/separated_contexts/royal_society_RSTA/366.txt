We propose finally to give an account of those characteristics of the bands which
are of most general interest. We begin with those of the metals, the curves of which
have been given in figure 12. In § 3, we have already referred to the fact that the N,,,(Z) and N,(£) must be
considered as components of the N(£) curve, which show different peculiarities. The
I(E)/v3 curves give, for the L,-spectra, N,,,(£), and for the K-spectra, N,(£). From
the curves of figure 12, by adding the results of the K- and L,-spectra of a given metal,
it can be seen that an N(E) curve of the general form shown in figure 2 is obtained.
