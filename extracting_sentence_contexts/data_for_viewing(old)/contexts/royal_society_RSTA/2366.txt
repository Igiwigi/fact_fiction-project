for many months or years [14,34]. Figure 6a shows that cooling of an initial hot ensemble of H}
ions (e.g. produced in a discharge ion source) in an 18 K blackbody environment would result in
the population of many metastable rotational states whose lifetimes exceed practical storage time
limits.

As a consequence of these metastable states (which are usually not populated in interstellar
space, with the notable exception of a metastable state observed in sightlines toward the Galactic
centre [35]), meaningful measurements will require the ions to be pre-cooled before injection into
the ring. A practical choice of technique to accomplish quenching of the high-lying rotational
states would be the use of a pulsed supersonic expansion source; however, it has been shown
that the ions experience a certain amount of re-heating during the extraction and acceleration
process [33]. Furthermore, studies at TSR have shown that the electron density and energy also
have an influence on the internal states of the ions [15]. In fact, inelastic collisions with electrons
that change the internal state of the H} ions may have cross sections that are larger than electron
recombination [36], and thus the final populations of the rotational states in the ring may even
depend on the measurement scheme.


Taking the uncertainties among all of these factors and parameters into account, it becomes | 10 |
clear that a state-selective diagnostics scheme (similar to the photodissociation measurements
