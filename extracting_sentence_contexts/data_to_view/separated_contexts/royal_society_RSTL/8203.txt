Foss. Atlas,' and De BLAINVILLE, © Ost6ographie, Sus,” also our fig. 4, Plate XXXVII.). How-
ever, in examining more attentively this proximal surface of the third metacarpal of
the Hog, we remark something quite new, and not met with in most of the fossil
Paridigitata, Owing to the over-development of the middle digits, the radial side of
the third metacarpal (Plate XXXVII. fig. 4) has spread inwards and pushed the
second metacarpal away from its typical articulation with the os magnum ; nay even

more, this second metacarpal has yielded one half of the surface of its carpal bone
to the encroachment of the third digit ; this last, besides the magnum, occupies
now one half of the trapezoid—a new fact in the history of the Paridigitate foot
that had important consequences. To show the reader more clearly that this modifica-
tion is a recent one, we turn to the fossil Suid. Unhappily, our knowledge of their
8keleton is very imperfect; and while genus after genus (not to speak of species) of the
fossil Suidz have been created merely on dental, often very slight and unimportant,
characters, the study of their skeleton has been much neglected.
