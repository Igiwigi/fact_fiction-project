contradiction have often been introduced even where the immediate results of
their experiments were accurately observed and recorded, and they have been
prevented from 80 directing their labours as to conduce to a gradual and steady
accumulation of knowledge.

As the early physiologists present to us the results of their own imaginings,
without eyen pretending to be possessed of any facts which directly support
them; the later and more rational inquirers have, from the causes just enume-
rated, been often betrayed into conclusions equally erroneous: and even in
making important additions to our knowledge, they have frequently done
what they could to render them useless and sometimes injurious to the cause
of science, which inferences, from a partial view of facts, often are, to a greater

semblance of legitimate deductions.

Thus it was that M. Ls GaLLors taught that the power of the heart is inde-
pendent of the brain, but derived from the spinal marrow, and that the powers
of circulation in every part of the body depend on the corresponding part of
that organ; inferences apparently supported by the facts he adduces, but wholly
