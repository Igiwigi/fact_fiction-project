Thus, despite the extent of the literature, our real knowledge of the Acanthodians
is limited in extent, and scarcely justifies the certainty with which these fishes have been
referred to the Elasmobranchii, or to some other position in the class Pisces. Acantho-
dian material is abundant; in connexion with this paper I must have examined about
1000 specimens, but of these very few are of value for the study of the morphology of
the head. The general absence of dermal bones which are individually recognizable,
the exceedingly small size of all the scales and head plates, and the fact that when
crushed flat, as with very few exceptions all Acanthodians are, the two surfaces of the
head become so closely pressed on to one another that it is difficult to distinguish their
structures no matter how well the individual bones may be preserved, probably
account for the fact that the Acanthodians are now the only group of primitive fishes
of whose morphology we have no detailed knowledge. The method of investigation I used is as follows. The head of the specimen was photographed with carefully considered lighting and
often through a coloured screen, and an enlargement at a magnification of from 3 to
10 diameters was made from the negative.
