Strength of Eaxcitationâ€”I have observed more than once (but am unable to
reproduce the experiment at will) that nerve in the: 8rd stage giving with weak
tetanisation the deflection N., gives with stronger tetanisation the deflection 8S. The

following is a case in point (826), which is reproduced in fig. 47, partly in order to

Fig. 47. (826.)

give an example of how such measurements are made, partly because a critic may
see in it internal evidence of some possible explanation or fallacy that I am unable to
detect. The facts here signify possibly that the nerve has been iu such a state that
fixed anelectrotonus was manifested at lower current strength than fugitive katelec-
trotonus, This possibility of a fixed anelectrotonic component is further supported
