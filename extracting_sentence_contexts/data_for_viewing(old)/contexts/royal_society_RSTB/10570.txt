distributional learning arise from a limited set of underlying not provide a good fit to human learning. First, transitional
memory process [20,45,58]. Conditional statistical learning probabilities are insensitive to frequency. That is, if XY
arises from extracting exemplars from the input, and the pro- occurs twice, and X occurs twice, the transitional probability
cesses of activation, decay and interference. Distributional between X and Y is 100%. If XY occurs 100 times, and X
statistical learning arises from the integration of information occurs 100 times, the transitional probability between X and
across these stored exemplars. We suggest that conditional Y is 100%. If learnersâ€™ sensitivity to conditional probability

and distributional statistical learning are deeply linked, both arises from their computation of transitional probability,


their confidence in grouping X and Y should be equivalent in
these two cases (as the transitional probability between X and
Y is identical in both cases). But in fact, learners have a stron-
ger expectation that X and Y will co-occur as they see the
grouping more frequently [89]. This sensitivity to frequency
falls naturally out of a memory-based perspective, given the
important role of repetition in memory (e.g. [90]).

Second, transitional probabilities are insensitive to the
order in which information is presented. That is, among a
stream with elements A, B, C and D, if there are high transi-
tional probabilities between A and B and C and D, learners
should learn to group AB and CD regardless of the order
in which these elements are presented. By contrast, order
effects are one of the signature empirical phenomena associ-
