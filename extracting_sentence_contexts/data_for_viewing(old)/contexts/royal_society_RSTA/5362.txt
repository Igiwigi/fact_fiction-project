ortrayed in the science-fiction literature and films, some of these being more
scientific, others more fictional (cf. [48]). Imagination, however, must not be
underestimated as a valuable means to advance knowledge towards new frontiers,
and is not at all an unscientific concept. It is also valuable that a broad public has
een given the opportunity to reflect on this topic. Similarly, scientists involved
in relevant research themselves should engage with journalists and the public (cf.
49]). Media reports and weblogs debating extra-terrestrial life, including those
hat relate to this very Royal Society Discussion Meeting, also provide some
evidence on public opinion and reactions that can be expected.

If data are absent or ambiguous, we tend to argue by retreating to analogies
or theories about universalities. Historical examples, however, need to be well
understood before these can serve as a guide, which is demonstrated by the fact

1at history is full of misinterpretations and misconceptions of itself (cf. [48,49]).
Rather than aliens invading Earth, most likely detection scenarios will involve
microbial organisms and/or extra-terrestrial life at a safe distance that prevents
yhysical contact. As far as exploring other life forms is concerned, any strategy
applied must exclude biological contaminationâ€”not only to protect ourselves,
yut also to preserve any alien life discovered as part of an overall commitment
o enhancing the richness and the diversity of life in the Universe [16]. For such
scenarios with well-contained risks, the dominant human response is unlikely to
de one of fear and pandemonium [48]. Human perceptions and representations of
alien life will not only derive from science, but, given that humanity is more than
just a collection of logic and facts, they will be highly influenced by cultural and
