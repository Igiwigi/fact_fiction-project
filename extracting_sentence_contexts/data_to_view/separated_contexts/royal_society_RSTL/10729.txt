102, The equation
aa*+by*+ez*=0

represents in general a nodal bicircular quartic, and by inverting with respect to the
node, we see that it is the inverse curve of an ellipse or hyperbola, according as « and
b have the same or opposite signs, with respect to 80me point in the same plane. Such a curve then bas two principal circles, with two single foci on each : it has
also four double tangents, two from the centre of each principal circle. If one of the principal circles becomes a straight line, it divides the curve

symmetrically ; corresponding, in fact, to the case where a conic is inverted on a point
in one of its axes. : If the radii of both principal circles are infinite the centre of inversion is the centre ©
of the conic : e.g., the lemniscate, whose equation would be of the form 2=aAa?
