Clearly, excitement about the neurotrophins has been fuelled by the discovery of a whole
family of molecules, now stretching from NGF, BDNF, NT-3, NT4/5 to NT-6 (the latter in
teleost fish only so far), and the simultaneous discovery of the trk family of high affinity
receptors for the neurotrophins. Much of the early work on neurotrophic molecules was focused
on their survival-promoting effects. An important recent change is the growing belief that
many other aspects of neuronal function may be regulated by trophic factors, ranging from
neurotransmitter production to neuronal morphology. One of the consequences of the
increased interest in neurotrophic factors is that researchers from a wide range of disciplines are
now actively considering the potential role of these molecules on a number of different levels.
There are therefore many, other than developmental biologists, actively working on trophic
factors, from biochemists working on signal transduction pathways to clinicians interested in
the potential of these molecules as therapeutic agents. In fact, the popularity of the
neurotrophins is reaching such a frenzied level that it seems likely that there will be a period
of unbridled enthusiasm in which researchers will fling neurotrophins at their own model
systems. We should be prepared for a few false positives.

This volume is also one of the consequences of burgeoning multidisciplinary interest in the
neurotrophins. It consists of a series of chapters written by the speakers of a international
meeting held at the Royal Society in London in September 1995. The meeting had the same
title as this volume. It was organised around the theme of neurotrophins and sensory neurones
because it struck us as organisers that many researchers used primary sensory neurones as the
test system for their experiments. We also felt that this theme would allow an exchange of
opinions by workers from very different disciplines.
