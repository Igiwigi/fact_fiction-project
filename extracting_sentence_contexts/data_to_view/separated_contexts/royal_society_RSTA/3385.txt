Since
the spatial part of Hy is a piecewise constant in the various regions of space, we can take for Dy(t)
the form

Assuming no other spatial aspects and a constant flux of particles, p(x, y;t) = p(x,y;0) is time
independent and denoted as p(x, y). Now each Dy(t) (with i=, II, II) will evolve independently. Indeed, if we insert this ansatz into the equation of motion,

dD. a ~ nm a

we reach for the right-hand side,

where in the last term we took account of the fact that in its integration intervals V(x) = —k and
V(y) =0. This immediately leads to an uncoupled equation of motion for each D;(t),
