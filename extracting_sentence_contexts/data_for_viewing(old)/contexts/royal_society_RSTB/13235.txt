hypoxia, social insects Termites are one of the most abundant terrestrial animals on earth [1,2]. A key
factor in terms of their ecological success is the reproductive division of labour

Author for correspondence: that is a central feature of eusociality. In a colony, a limited number of male and

female reproductives (kings and queens) produce all the offspring and a large
number of non-reproductive individuals (workers and soldiers; but workers
can become at least neotenic reproductives in most lower termites [3-5])
perform most of foraging, nest-building, brood care and nest-guarding [6,7].
Intriguingly, reproductives and non-reproductives exhibit up to a 100-fold
difference in lifespans, and even more compelling is the fact that the reproduc-
tives live for an order of magnitude longer than solitary insects [8]. These
features are also found in social Hymenoptera such as ants and honeybees,
but the eusociality of termites has evolved independently of social Hymenop-
tera [9,10]. Therefore, unlike social Hymenoptera, termites have
hemimetabolous development, bisexual societies and diplodiploid sex determi-
nation system [7]. Most notable is the continuous presence of sperm-producing
ings in termites, which is a universal characteristic among termites, but com-
pletely absent in social Hymenoptera [1,7]. These differences result in an
interesting feature in which only the queens are long-lived in social Hymenop-
tera, while in termites, not only the queens but also the kings exhibit both high
reproductive outputs and extraordinarily long lives [5,7,11-16]. Although long-
evity is negatively correlated with reproduction in most organisms [17-19],
