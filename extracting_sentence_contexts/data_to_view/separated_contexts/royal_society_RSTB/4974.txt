In the Echinopluteus of HZ. miliaris one rudi-
ment of a pair originates slightly in advance of the other. This might suggest that the
complex tooth has arisen from a linear series, the component parts of which have, owing
to crowding, become somewhat displaced, and have arranged themselves in pairs, the
first remaining single. Otherwise there seems to be no explanation of this fact. The very open meshwork exhibited by the developing plates in the pluteus is probably
a larval characteristic for, after metamorphosis, the developing plates grow more rapidly
and are, from the first, more compact with the exception perhaps of those which are
formed in the peristome. The spines, which all develop in the same way as the inter-
ambulacral (typical) ones of the pluteus, are also from the first more solid, the prongs
and cross bars being more robust.
