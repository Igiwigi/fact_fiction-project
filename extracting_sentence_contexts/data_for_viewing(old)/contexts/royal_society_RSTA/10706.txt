as two prominent peaks ; either of these processes increases the resistivity by about
12 per cent. upon the initial state. Hard drawing after annealing between stages
(2) and (8) brings the wire down to nearly the original condition, and again, after
tempering, cold drawing through two or three holes decidedly reduces resistivity, but
an unmistakable increase sets in at the 11th and 12th stages, From the last point
the curve has been extended by a broken line to include two more points belonging
to still finer wires, Nos. 13a and 14a, which are not, however, of identically the same
material as the others. Nevertheless, the broken line emphasizes the fact that the
effect of extreme drawing is prejudicial to conductivity. These contrary effects
of drawing, it will be remembered, were also in evidence in the curve of magnetic
temperature coefticient, and in both curves the change occurs near to the 8th and
9th stages. A length of the steel wire upon which the experiments just described
were carried out was subsequently made glass hard, and the resistivity in that
state was 2760 x 10~%, or about 70 per cent. higher than the wire in its state
of least resistance. It is worth notice that minimum resistivity occurs in the
hard drawn and hot rolled conditions, and hence the order of resistivity in an
ascending scale is: hard drawn or hot rolled; annealed or tempered ; glass hard.
