ture in every possible direction, and even if it were in a rapid state of gyration. If
the particles possessed the structure that produces cireular polarization the fluid
would develop the phenomena exhibited by oil of turpentine, &c.”

And again+, © The structure of the particles of a circularly polarizing fluid must
be exactly the same along every one of its diameteys ; that is, the structure must be
symmetrical round the centre of the particle, or analogous to that which takes place
in common polarization when a sphere of glazs has its density regularly increasing
or regularly diminishing towards its centre,”

I have quoted these remarkable passages at length, because it appears to me that
what is there advanced merely as a hypothesis, acquires a considerable degree of
probability from the facts which I have stated, since I have succeeded in rendering
actually visible circular particles of excessive minuteness, in each of which the micro-
scope detects the very structure imagined by BrewsTE, viz. the black cross and four
8ectors of light. So that it appears not improbable that the circular-polarizing pro-
perties of fluids may be owing to the presence of multitudes of particles similar to
these, which they hold in solution.
