obtain approximate solutions at the stages 1 and 3. The use of (A. 6) is satisfactory as an
approximation to the differential equation. For the boundary derivative the formula for
r = 2in table 1 is generally preferred, but r = 4 does not lead to very great complication and
can often be used with advantage.

It may sometimes be convenient to arrange the mesh so that the boundary is no longer
a line of nodal points, but lies half-way between them, as in figure 3.

The difference equation (A. 6) is now applied at internal points only, and the fictitious
point —1 is as before calculated in terms of internal points by means of a formula for the
derivative at B. This is given by

h(dw/dx) = A, —gyA3 + fp At , —sHpA® + BAS, —..* (A. 12)

This formula converges ultimately like (A. 8), but the important early terms have smaller
coefficients. For a boundary condition of type (I. 4), therefore, fewer stages of the repetitive
process are required in this method, but for type (I.5) its advantage largely disappears,
since some interpolation is required to give the boundary value in terms of internal values.

Two final remarks must be made regarding second-order equations. First, formulae like
(A. 12) can be established for cases in which the boundary lies anywhere between two mesh
