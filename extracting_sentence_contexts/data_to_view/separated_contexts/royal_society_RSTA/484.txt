Using the first two compounds named, no tumours had
E been recorded when the experiments were terminated (perhaps a little prematurely) at the
© 409th and 465th days respectively; in all other cases such experiments were allowed to
continue to their natural conclusion. With all the inhibitory compounds tested, a few
sarcomata appeared at or near the site of injection, as well as remote tumours mainly
comprising carcinomata of the external acoustic duct, mammary adenomata, and chol-
angiomata. That these tumours were in fact induced is made certain by their number,
nature and distribution, although their latent period was in all cases relatively long (from
7 to 18 months); sarcoma and cholangioma are unknown in this stock, and mammary
adenoma excessively rare (only one spontaneous case has been observed in several tens of
thousands of animals examined). Even more striking, squamous keratinizing carcinoma
of the external acoustic duct does not appear to occur in the rat in any circumstances de
novo, and has previously been described only as a result of administration of the carcinogens
2-anthramine and 2-acetamidofluorene (Bielschowsky 1947). Bearing in mind its natural
