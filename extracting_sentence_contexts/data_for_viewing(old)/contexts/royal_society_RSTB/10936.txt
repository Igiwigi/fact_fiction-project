the time of ovulation as blood and interstitial fluid infuses
the region as an advertisement of oestrus [10,11]; in some
macaques, these changes are also accompanied by darkening
of the facial skin, presumably also caused by perfusion of the
region by blood [12]. In Old World monkeys and apes, the
intensity of coloration of glabrous skin is under hormonal
control and is considered a sign of fertility in females and
competitive ability in males [12-14].

The genetic and developmental processes that produce
the complex topographical arrangements of coloration on
the face, trunk and limbs are not well understood [15], and
are still mostly a matter of conjecture. The fact that many pat-
terns follow presumed pathways of migration of the neural
crest-derived melanocytes into the face and trunk during
development warrants further study [5].

Humans are distinguished from their non-human rela-
tives by an absence of most fur and an almost complete
lack of regional patterning in hair coloration, except for
male facial hair in some populations [16]. Most of the surface
area of human skin is covered with almost invisible vellus
hairs and is often referred to as ‘functionally naked’. The rem-
nants of the primate hair coat are the localized concentrations
of non-agouti terminal hairs of similar colour that occur on
