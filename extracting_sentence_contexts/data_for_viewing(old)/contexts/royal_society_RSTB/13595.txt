small electronic devices) has revealed how species of wild animals undertake
remarkable feats of athleticism that set the benchmark for vertebrate performance.
In the aerial environment, this includes non-stop endurance migratory flights
of over 11000 km by bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica [1]), extreme long-
distance migrations of more than 100000 km by Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea
[2)), high-altitude flights of over 6000 m altitude by bar-headed geese (Anser
indicus [3-6]) and non-stop flights for more than 10 months of the year by
common swifts (Apus apus [7]). Similar remarkable feats have been recorded in
the aquatic realm, including dives beyond 500m deep by emperor penguins
(Aptenodytes forsteri [8]), dives beyond 2 km deep by elephant seals (Mirounga
sp.) resulting in near total venous blood oxygen depletion [9-11] and dives to
nearly 3 km deep [12] for over 3 h [13] by Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavir-
ostris). These astonishing feats highlight the fact that not only is it important to
conserve wildlife for aesthetic and ethical reasons [14], but also because these ath-
letic species may help to highlight medical pathways and approaches for some of
the greatest health challenges for humans, including hypoxia (e.g. strokes and
heart attacks), diabetes and obesity. The inspiration for this theme issue came
from animal biologists attending conferences of Extreme and Expedition
