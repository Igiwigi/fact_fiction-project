Uncertainty in distributed hydrological modelling generally has been extensively discussed in
the literature [57-60]. In addition, although the calibration procedure produced a reasonable fit
with observed flows and has academic precedent, it is a highly idealized approach. Another
significant source of uncertainty comes from the fact the evidence behind the impact of physical
NFM remains inconclusive. Any numerical replication of intervention impact is therefore subject
to significant error (in terms of both magnitude and parameterization). Although representation
of the interventions used in this study has been informed by the literature (table 1), extrapolation
of their impact within the Asker catchment introduces further uncertainty.
