Tn all cases where the results of other investigators were available these have been
placed in parallel columns for easy comparison. An exception to this should be men-
tioned. In the case of chromium the recently published values by Miutrkan and BowEn*
appear to have no correspondence whatever to the values recorded here, in spite of the
fact that the wave-lengths of known lines, such as carbon, were determined as accurately
on our chromium plates as on almost any others. Second-order lines have been eliminated from these tables, except in the case of carbon,
in which case all lines which appeared on the carbon plates have been retained, second-
order lines being indicated by the symbols 8.0. In cases where some doubt exists the
same symbols are used, but followed by an interrogation mark.
