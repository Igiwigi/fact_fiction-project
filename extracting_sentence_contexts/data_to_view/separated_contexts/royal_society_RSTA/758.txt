This could be described by
saying that the intervals 5, (E) are not unnecessarily broad. The problem of determining the shortest system of confidence intervals is
immediately reduced to that of finding appropriate regions of acceptance. In fact,

using the Proposition I and II or the Corollary I expressed by (26), we may rewrite
the condition (97) as follows :
PifBie As (0/1) |0,°} :P {(EeA.(6%)[ 81°), ©. 3 se (98)
where A, (6,) and A (6,) denote the regions of acceptance leading to the systems
of confidence intervals C, and C respectively. If C, is the shortest system, then (98) should hold whatever 6,° and 6’, and what-
ever the regions of acceptance A (6;), provided they correspond to the fixed confi-
dence coefficient «.
