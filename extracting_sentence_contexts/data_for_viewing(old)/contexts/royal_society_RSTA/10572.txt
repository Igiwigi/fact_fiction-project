of are, the vapour film, and, consequently, the crater, is smaller with a cored than
with a solid positive carbon, explains why the are can carry such a much larger
current without hissing when the positive carbon is cored than when it is solid. For
T have shown* that hissing is the result of that direct contact of the crater with the
air which follows when the crater grows too large to cover the end only of the
positive carbon and so extends along its sides, and this must happen with a smaller
current the larger the crater is with a given current, i.e, it must happen with a
smaller current when the positive carbon is solid than when it is cored.

How the Change in the Cross-Sections of the Mist und the Vapour Film, due to
a Change of Current, is Affected by Coring Either ov Both Carbons.

Consider next the facts concerning the influence of the cores on the values
of 8V/8A, when a small alternating current is superimposed on a direct current
normal are, that the resistance of the are is affected by this superposition. Here we
have to deal, not with the whole P.D. between the carbons, but with the change
in that P.D. that accompanies a given small chunge of current, and I shall show that
the effect of the core on this change must always be to add a positive increment
to 8V/sA, the amount of which depends on the value of the direct current, the
length of the are, and the frequency of the alternating current.

The influence of the core on the value 6V/8A is two-fold ; it alters the amount by
which the cross-sections of the vapour film and the mist change, with a given change
of current ; and it makes their specific resistances vary with the current. We will
take each separately, the ghange of cross-section first. I shall call the part of 5V/8A
