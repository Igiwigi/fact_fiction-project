Dr. F1xer's paper clearly shows that he made the fundamental
observation in the case of Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata quite independently of
my suggestion in Â© Nature;* and Dr. Lifzxex's reference to this paper has been of special
value to me from the fact that up to the time when T received it (viz. February 1876)
no one in England appears to have been aware that Dr. Enter had done any work in
connexion with the neryous system of Meduse.
