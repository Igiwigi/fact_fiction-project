This has the effect of mobilizing more of the oil behind the displacement front and increasing
recovery. The potential to use wettability alteration as the main recovery mechanism in an EOR process 1s |
has only recently become a major topic of research. This is despite the fact that it was first
recognized in 1959 by Wagner & Leach [69] and tested in the field in 1962 [89]. These workers “3
controlled the wettability through adjusting the pH and sodium content of the injected water. [8
Wettability alteration was recognized as a secondary recovery mechanism in ASP floods (resulting :<
from the addition of the alkali to the chemical mix in the injected water [68]) but developments of 8
these floods focused primarily on minimizing the IFT. :

The recovery process involves injecting brine, with a low salinity and that is depleted in
divalent cations (compared with the in situ brine), into sandstone reservoirs. It should be noted
that the salinity should be as low as possible without adversely affecting flow performance.
