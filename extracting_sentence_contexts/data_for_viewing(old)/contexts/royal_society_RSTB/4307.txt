does not seem to have been kept on any regular system. Prior to the year 1703,
measles as a cause of death was included in a joint group with small-pox. For a
considerable number of years after this date, though measles was distinguished
separately as a cause of death in the Bills of Mortality, it must have happened that
either large numbers of deaths due to measles were still returned under the heading
of small-pox, or that epidemics of measles were only occasionally of a severe type.
This conclusion follows from a consideration of the intervals which exist between
succeeding epidemics. In addition, it would seem that at times a number of
deaths, which should have been distributed over a series of weeks, are collected into
one entry. Thus, for example, an entry of 100 deaths, though this is an extreme
case, is given as occurring in one week, though the number of deaths in the weeks
immediately preceding and following are barely one-fourth of this. That the
figures are not a misprint is shown by the fact that the total for the year corresponds
to this entry. It is, of course, possible that a return from some large childrenâ€™s
institution, such as the Foundling Hospital, might furnish the majority of these
deaths, or that, on the other hand, there may have been an error in the original
manuscript. Further, some of the epidemies recorded are exceedingly large. When

this happens, the results derived from the periodogram analyses, when the period is

long, must be carefully questioned. In such a case, with each increase in the period,

the number of the rows in the columns is reduced. Consequently, an epidemic of

exceptional size tends to unduly increase the values of the columns in which the
