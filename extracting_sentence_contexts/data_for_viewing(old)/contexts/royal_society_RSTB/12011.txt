(51) assumed the proposition he smoked to be true. Therefore,
we say that regret is a factive verb.

(51) Sam regrets that he smoked.
a. Assertion: Sam is disappointed that he smoked.
b. Presupposition: Sam has smoked.

(52) Sam dreamed that he smoked.
a. Assertion: Sam had a dream that he smoked.
b. Presupposition: Sanihas-smoked.

Furthermore, we can demonstrate that the disappointment
meaning and factive meaning carried by regret reside on differ-
ent levels of meaning. Ifa speaker asks a yes/no question of (51),
as in (53), the speaker is asking about Sam’s disappointment,
not about the underlying fact of his smoking. Similarly, if the
speaker negates (51), as in (54), they are negating Sam’s disap-
pointment, not the underlying fact of his smoking. Also,
attempts to carry on the discourse by directly addressing the
factive meaning are considered unacceptable to speakers.
Therefore, the factive meaning of regret is encoded as a presup-
position because it projects out of questions and negation.

(53) Does Sam regret having smoked?
a. No, he isn’t disappointed that he smoked. (Assertion)
