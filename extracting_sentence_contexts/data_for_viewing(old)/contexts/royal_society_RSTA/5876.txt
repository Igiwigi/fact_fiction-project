globally static. Normally, when we talk about AdS we simply mean its universal cover, a space
without closed timelike curves. dS and AdS spaces are very important in current primordial
cosmology, especially in braneworlds and holographic models of the early universe (see section
on branes in Part B of this survey). dS space also has an instability, classically forbidden, associated
with the possibility of defining a non-thermal temperature using the event horizon [12]. In this
case, one may use the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Kottler) solution that describes a black hole
immersed in de Sitter space, to construct Euclidean instanton solutions with special properties
(cf. [13] and refs. therein).


(c) Fractal universes

Einstein’s static universe was the first application of general relativity to cosmology, and, in fact,
it created such a boost to the study of universes that an application of the old Newton’s theory
to cosmology seemed an impossibility. However, in 1922 the claim of Einstein of an upper bound
to the galaxy hierarchy was to be challenged by C. Charlier [14], who introduced a fractal universe
as it may now be called—a distribution of a never-ending repetition of clusters ad infinitum, on
larger and larger scales (the word fractal was introduced much later [15]).

Charlier’s universe possessing a fractal hierarchy was based on earlier ideas of F. d’Albe and
others (see [16] for an early history of such ideas) and was arranged such that, although the
overall density and volume were infinite, the average matter density was zero, thus bypassing
the obstacles of the ‘gravitational paradox’. (According to the Newton-Ivory theorem [17], at
infinite distance in an infinite universe of constant density, the Newtonian force may take arbitrary
values.)
