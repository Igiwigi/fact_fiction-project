This
calculation seems to indicate that the region on the current temperature diagram
when the current begins to be proportional to the square root of the absolute
temperature is much higher than any temperature which can be reached in the
ordinary way. The magnitude of the currents which have been obtained with low voltages
indicate that a vacuum bounded by a hot conductor is, at any rate under certain
circumstances, an extremely good conductor of electricity. In fact, it seems probable
that such a vacuum is capable of becoming the best conductor that can possibly be
obtained. The conductivity of metals is limited by the shortness of the mean free
path of the ions, whereas the mean free path of a corpuscle in an atmosphere of
corpuscles is probably very large. All that is necessary, therefore, to produce a big
current is to supply the ions quickly enough at the hot surface, that is, to raise the

temperature of the hot conductor to a sufficient extent.
