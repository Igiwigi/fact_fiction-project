new conditional strategies under a social norm. Contrastingly,
pro-social punishment positively reinforces the reputational
information, increasing the level of cooperation in the popu-
lation. This result is in contrast to Gurerk et al. [52], which
establishes an experimental superiority of punishment insti-
tutions over reputational mechanisms for the public goods
game and poses doubts about whether this result can be
extended to experiments where the OPGG is played.

It should be noted that all strategies with cooperation as
the main action are selected in the ecosystem for this set-
up, and in remarkably similar proportions. This follows
from the fact that they always act as cooperators in a strongly
cooperative environment, thus becoming indistinguishable
from each other (thereby avoiding selection).

Our results qualify the findings of the experimental litera-
ture on anti-social punishment [24,53,54]. Such contributions
work with designs that rigidly separate individual choices
about actions and punishments from reputational concerns.
This is particularly true for Rand & Nowak [25], which was
performed on Amazon Mechanical Turk, where professionals
play many games. In recent experiments, run in-person and
with samples of the general population where individuals
knew they were playing with citizens from the same villages
