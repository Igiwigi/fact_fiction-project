The appearance of
"the perithecia of the young Spheriz was different from that of their mature condition ;
they were of a light ochrey-yellow colour, instead of being black, or nearly 80. The
perithecia of the Cytispora were 80 exactly like those of the Sphwria, that without a
microscopical examination of the contents, it was not possible to distinguish the one
from the other. The association in growth, the exact similarity of the perithecia, and
the fact, now well established, that other species of Spheriz possess a cytisporous as well
as an ascigerous fructification, would seem almost sufficient grounds for assuming the
identity of these two plants, but a further argument in favour of such identity was afforded
by the occurrence of the perithecia of the Cytispora and of the Spheria within the same
cireumscribing line. Spheria verruceformis belongs, as is well known, to the division
Lignosw, one of the characteristics of which is the existence of a black line surrounding
the base of the stroma, in which the perithecia are imbedded. If a thin section of the
substance of this black line be examined under the microscope when the Spheria is ripe,
it appears to be composed of dry carbonaceous matter in which it is hardly possible
to trace any structure; but if examined at the period of growth of the above-mentioned
specimens, it, is 8een to consist of strings of oval cells of a clear dark brown colour.
