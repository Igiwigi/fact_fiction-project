It will be found that I have obtained, finally, expressions of very remarkable sim-
plicity; to accomplish this, however, I have been obliged to go through tedious pro-
cesses of reduction, the details of which are here subjoined, in order that my results
may be verified or corrected without difficulty. In order to give an additional example
.of the great facility with which terms in the disturbing function are arrived at by my
method, I have calculated one of those given by Professor Airy, and which is required
in the determination of his inequality of Venus; and I have arrived at the result which
he has given. The same method, with certain modifications, is applicable to the de-
velopment of the disturbing function in terms of the true longitudes. The terms in
the disturbing function which give rise to the secular inequalities of the elliptic con-
stants, when the terms of the order of the fourth powers of the eccentricities and
inclinations are retained, and higher powers of those quantities are neglected, are as
follows : and I propose, as they form, in fact, a system apart, to distinguish them by
the indices given in the left-hand column.
