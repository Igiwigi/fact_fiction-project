upon the eye. Each, therefore, was instantaneous in its existence (1436.). Each had
the conical root complete (1426.).

1429. On using a smaller ball, the general brush was smaller, and the sound,
though weaker, more continuous. On resolving the brush into its elementary parts,
as before, these were found to occur at much shorter intervals than in the former
ease, but till the discharge was intermitting.

1430. Employing a wire with a round end, the brush was still smaller, but, as be-
fore, separable into successive discharges. The sound, though feebler, was higher
in pitch, being a distinct musical note.

1431. The sound is, in fact, due to the recurrence of the noise of each separate
discharge, and these, happening at intervals nearly equal under ordinary ciremn-
stances, cause a definite note to be heard, which, rising in pitch with the increased
rapidity and regularity of the intermitting discharges, gives a ready and accurate
measure of the intervals, and s0 may be used in any case when the discharge is heard,
even though the appearances may not be seen, to determine the element of time. So
also, when, by bringing the hand towards a projecting rod or ball, the pitch of the
tone produced by a brusby discharge increases, the effect informs us that we have
increased the induction (1374.), and by that means increased the rapidity of the
alternations of charge and discharge.

1432. By using wires with finer terminations, smaller brushes were obtained, until
they could hardly be distinguished as brushes; but as long as sowund was heard, the
