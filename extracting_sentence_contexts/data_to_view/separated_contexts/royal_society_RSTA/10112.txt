We proceed to discuss the colours produced by diffused particles of copper in order
to discover the cause of colour of copper ruby glass. The values of the expression
nr’ [pd for v = 1°56, v = 1°5, and »y = 1°0 given in Table IL., are plotted in fig. 6, the
maxima being determined as in the case of fig. 1 (ef §5 above). As in the case of
silver, these curves should fairly accurately represent the absorptions produced by
copper spheres in glass v = 1°56, in glass » = 1°5, and by copper spheres or molecules

* The fact that Ry increases from yellow to red, while R diminishes in the same range, would be
accounted for if the black paper with which Sir Witt1aM ABNryY backed the stained face of the glass
reflected 2 per cent. of the light incident on it. Further experiments are to be made on this.
