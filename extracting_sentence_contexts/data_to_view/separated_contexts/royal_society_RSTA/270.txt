Increased likelihood of a noise-induced transition can come with
increased fluctuations, consistent with the hypothesis that the BA was basically
noise-induced [13]. In contrast, the decline in variance during the Younger Dryas
in the Cariaco basin data could reflect declining fluctuations in freshwater forcing
of the Atlantic as Northern Hemisphere ice sheets re-stabilized during this cold
interval. The fact that an abrupt transition still occurred at the end of the
Younger Dryas, despite declining noise level, may strengthen the case for an
underlying bifurcation. However, the effect of noise on the likelihood of transitions
depends on whether noise is multiplied by, or added to, the state variable of a
system [37]. Overall, the DFA method appears to give the least ambiguous results (table 1).
