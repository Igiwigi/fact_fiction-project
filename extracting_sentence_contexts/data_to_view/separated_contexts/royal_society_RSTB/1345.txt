In some animals the symptoms
have been exceedingly slight, the cut showing little abnormality a few hours after the
operation ; in one case in which the lobe was completely removed no differences of
motion or sensation could be detected on either side. It was more usual, however,
to find some of the characteristic cerebellar symptoms. Rotation fits after the
operation, or from irritation of the wound, were frequently seen ; for the first few days
there was unsteadiness of gait, which undoubtedly appeared more related to the right
side (side of lesion) than the left ; it could, in fact, usually be made out that there
was distinct weakness of the right side. There is undoubted dulling of sensation
on the right side, especially in the hind limb; this phenomenon had early
attracted my attention, and still earlier that of Dr. RussExt, working on other animals
in the same laboratory. The weakening of sensation and motor power appears
centred in the hind limb, and as previously stated I have not noticed wrist drop as in
the case of hemisphere cats.
