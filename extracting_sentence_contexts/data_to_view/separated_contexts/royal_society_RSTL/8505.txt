that action and reaction are equal. In these experiments a hot
body causes a cold body to recede, while a cold body causes the hot body to approach ;
s0 that if both the bodies were free to move, we should have the cold body running
away and the hot body running after it. This fact is, I take it, a conclusive proof that
the force does not act from body to body, but between each body and the medium in
which it is placed ; that each body, as it were, propels itself through the surrounding
medium in a direction opposite to its hottest side. The truth of this reasoning has been set beyond all doubt by a very beautiful experiment
made by Dr. ScxvsreR. The results of this he is about to communicate to the Royal
Society ; and as his paper will contain a full account of the experiment, it is only neces-
sary here for me to refer to the results and the way in which they bear on the subject
in hand.
