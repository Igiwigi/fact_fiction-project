Viewed externally there appear
to be three vessels from the commencement. These are the left systemic trunk,
lying ventrally to the right, a right systemico-carotid trunk (i.e., the vessel from
which arise the right systemic arch and the two common carotids), lying dorsally and
slightly to the right and the pulmonary arch, lying to the left side somewhat dorsally
but just visible at the base of the ventricle from the ventral side. A reconstruction
revealed the fact that the internal separation of the trunks was not complete, a point
that was afterwards verified by careful dissection. At the base the three vessels stand
