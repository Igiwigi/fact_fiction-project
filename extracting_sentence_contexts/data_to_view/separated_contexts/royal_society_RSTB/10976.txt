Another disadvantage in the same vein is that many truths
about finite cardinals are independent of numeral systems. An example is the truth that every finite cardinal number
greater than one is a prime or a product of primes. This is
due to the fact that there is no infinite decreasing sequence of
finite cardinal numbers [6].

(c) Mentalism

‘Mentalism’ here denotes the view that a cardinal number is
a mental representation or a mental (or intellectual) construc-
tion. The mathematician and founder of mathematical
intuitionism Luitzen Brouwer was the chief proponent of
a mentalist view in recent times [7]. The mathematician
Dedekind [8] also gave voice to mentalism when he wrote
of numbers as free creations of the mind, as did Cantor [9]
when he wrote that the cardinal number of a set has existence
in our mind as an intellectual image of the set.
