of the bridge was also measured and found to be about 0-005 ohm. The temperature
coefficients of the 1000-ohm, 100-ohm and 10-ohm “Q” coils and of the “ R” and
“$* coils were determined, and the Q/a relationship was checked in the manner
indicated above. Finally, the bridge was standardised by using it to measure the
resistances of 10-ohm and 100-ohm Wolff coils. The Wolff coils used were kept under
observation throughout the work and compared weekly with the sealed standard
coils of the Electrical Measurements Department of the Laboratory.


TEMPERATURE SCALE BETWEEN 0° AND 100° C. 9

In measuring the 100-ohm coil it was found that the bridge reading rose steadily
for some time after switching on the battery current, due to the fact that when high
resistances are being measured the ratio coils carry a much heavier current than the
“Q” coils and the heating effect on the “S$” coil is sufficient to increase the ratio
perceptibly. It can be shown that if the total current given by the battery is 7,, that
passing through the thermometer 7,, and the bridge be balanced at a reading Q, then

4, = (Q/1000 + 1) %.

The current through the “$8” coil is therefore (Q/1000) 7. The change in 8 with
current was determined by arranging it to form one arm of a Wheatstone Bridge with a
high resistance connected as a shunt on one of the arms so as to give a fine variation of
resistance, and varying the current through a wide range. From the figures thus
obtained a table of “ ratio heating corrections * was drawn up. These were tabulated
