As far as exploring other life forms is concerned, any strategy
applied must exclude biological contamination—not only to protect ourselves,
yut also to preserve any alien life discovered as part of an overall commitment
o enhancing the richness and the diversity of life in the Universe [16]. For such
scenarios with well-contained risks, the dominant human response is unlikely to
de one of fear and pandemonium [48]. Human perceptions and representations of
alien life will not only derive from science, but, given that humanity is more than
just a collection of logic and facts, they will be highly influenced by cultural and
y»sychological factors. Therefore, reactions will not necessarily be homogeneous,
and reality may defy common myths [49]. It is believed by some that establishing

1e presence of extra-terrestrial life as a fact will cause a crisis for certain
religious faiths.
