own opinion is that in Danea and Kaulfussia, which are the extreme examples of
extension of leaf-area, while the leaves themselves are simply pinnate, or even

unbranched (D. simplicifolia), extension was accompanied in the former genus by

elongation of the individual sorus, in the latter by abstriction of sori, and that both

were derived from the circular type of sorus so prevalent in early times, as exemplified

by Asterotheca or Scolecopteris ; Marattia and Angiopteris, with their slightly elon-

gated sori, would occupy a middle position. It will be shown that the facts relating

to irregular and partial septations in the Marattiaceous sorus will accord with these

views.

A further point for discussion is the relation of the sporangia to one another in
the sorus. Among fossil and modern Marattiacee various gradations may be seen
between such as have their sporangia quite separate, and those in which they are
united from base to apex. Certain of those best known may be placed in series as
follows, starting from those with separate sporangia :--Hawlea, Angiopteris, Scole-
copteris, Asterotheca; Kaulfussia, Danea, Without for a moment suggesting that
such plants as those named ever constituted un evolutionary sequence, they at least
