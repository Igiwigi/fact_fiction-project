We could expect eventual global average temperatures to rise less than previously feared. However, when that decrease in mean is due to a widening of the uncertainty range—for example,
if it is due to a lowering of the lower bound—this news may not overall be good. In fact, that is
what we find may be the case here. We first develop the general economic framework that underlies our analysis in §2a. We
represent an increase in uncertainty as a mean-preserving spread (MPS).
