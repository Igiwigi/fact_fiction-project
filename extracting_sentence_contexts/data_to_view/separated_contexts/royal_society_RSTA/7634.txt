On normally quiet days the
2 second time differential d2H/dé? of the uniform component of the earth’s horizontal field is
sufficiently small for no appreciable errors to be introduced, provided the astaticism of the
A magnetometer is more than 2000 or so. Thus no reduction in errors is achieved by field
compensation on a quiet day. The fact that the observed errors are generally considerably larger than the calculated
='Brownian error, and that the errors are very variable, must therefore be sought in other
} eb causes than changes in the earth’s horizontal field. These observed errors may be due to

= (a) changes in the second time derivative d*H/dé dz of the vertical gradient of the earth’s
S horizontal field, (6) gross thermal disturbances affecting the magnetometer, (c) mechanical
© disturbances. The present data are insufficient to indicate the relative importance of these
5 three factors.
