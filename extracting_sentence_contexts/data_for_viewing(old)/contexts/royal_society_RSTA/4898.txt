Relating magnetic reconnection to coronal

heating. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A373: 20140263.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2014.0263 It is clear that the solar corona is being heated and that

coronal magnetic fields undergo reconnection all the

time. Here we attempt to show that these two facts
Accepted: 5 January 2015 are related—i.e. coronal reconnection generates heat.
This attempt must address the fact that topological
