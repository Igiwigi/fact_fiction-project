and his many associates. In the New World chameleons do not exist, and conse-
quently the American workers have turned to other lizards, chiefly Anolis and Phryno-
soma. Thus it has come about that most modern workers in this field are relatively
unfamiliar with the chameleon, and have tended to overlook the many interesting
facts concerning colour change in this animal recorded in the earlier literature. But there is another, and perhaps more cogent reason for the neglect which the
work of the earlier investigators has suffered during the last ten or fifteen years. The
discovery of the endocrine control of pigmentary effectors in amphibia, chiefly through
the investigations of Hoapen and WinTon (1922, 1923), served to discredit all the
previous work on the alleged nervous co-ordination of colour change in this group.
