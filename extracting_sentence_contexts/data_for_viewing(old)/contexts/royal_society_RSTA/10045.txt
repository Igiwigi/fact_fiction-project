Observe also that the order of the numbers in brackets in any number N (...) can
be reversed at pleasure and thus new forms of results obtained.
As a verification: from the tables

(5) N (12) N (11) = N (1217) + N (181) = N (1°2) + N (12°) ;
DOM. 2? es = 9 + 11 = 4 + 16

N (123) + N (15) = N (812) + N (42).

The fact that the multiplication is not commutative formally is of great importance

in the theory of these numbers.
