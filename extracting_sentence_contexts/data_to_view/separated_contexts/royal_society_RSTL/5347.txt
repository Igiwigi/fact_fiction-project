In arts.‚Äù (65.),(66.), I consider the relation of the
Bezoutiant;to, the differential determinant, 80 called, by Jacomi, but which, for greater
brevity I call the Jacobian. On proper substitutions being made in the Bezontiant
of 'the (m) variables which it contains (mz being the degree in x, y of F and g), the
Bezoutiant becomes identical with the Jacobian to F and 9; but as it is afterwards


414 MR. SYLVESTER ON A THEORY OF THE CONJUGATE

shown, this is not a property peculiar to the Bezoutiant ; in fact there exists a whole
family of quadratic forms of m variables, lineo-linear (like the Bezoutiant) in respect
of the coefficients in # and 8, all of which-enjoy the-same property. + The-number of
individuals of such family must evidently be infinite, because any linear combination
of any two of them must possess a similar property ; I have discovered, however, that
the number of independent forms of this kind is limited, being equal to the number
of odd integers not greater than the degree of the two functions
