many facts which indicate that the distribution of the motor-roots is arranged on a
segmental plan in accordance with the terms of a bequest dating back to a time
when the present environment of the limb, especially in its Mammalian form, had
no preponderant weight in the shaping thereof. As regards functional value this
character of the Mammalian limb is on a par with details of structure which are

not specific, and, therefore, with other details of structure outside those immediately
© acquired by the species, not to be considered as of necessity of present functional
importance. The functional use of the contribution of one or two nerve-fibres to a
muscle requiring hundreds is difficult to see; the probability of the occurrence
of such poverty-stricken contributions is, on the view of the morphological necessity
of the ray-arrangement of the limb musculature, so high as to be only what might
have been expected from theoretical considerations. The fact that certain’of the
motor-roots of the limb contribute fibres to the innervation of certain muscles
in such scanty number as to be ineffective for movement is a further argument
for the morphological rather than functional character of the motor-root distribution
in the Mammalian limb. A number of motor-fibres, too small to evoke appreciable
movement in a muscle when excited electrically, will hardly be effective for movement
under the action of the will.

As to the relation between delicacy of co-ordination and number of nerve-roots
contributing to motor innervation, one remembers that no muscles are more delicately
adjustible than the ocular, although their individual innervation must be considered
uni-segmental.
