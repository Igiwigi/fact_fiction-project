Aj, -..,4, are positive parameters whose product is 1, one can deduce that (3) then has in
fact infinitely many solutions. Further, by suitable choice of Aj, +++5A, it follows that there
are then infinitely many solutions of (3) for which any nâ€”1 of | x, |, ..., | x, | are arbitrarily
small (possibly zero). But in most of the cases where one has reason to suppose that there are always an infinity
of solutions of an inequality such as (2), it is not easy to establish this by an extension of the
method used to prove the existence of a single solution.
