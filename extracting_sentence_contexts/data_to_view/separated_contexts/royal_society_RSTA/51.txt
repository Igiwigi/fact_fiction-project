irection of the wind is powerfully influenced by the distribution of pressure at high
els, it is more important, as far as the weather of the winter months is concerned,
to know the variations of pressure from the normal at the highest hill-stations than at
my place on the plains. In May there are considerable fluctuations over both regions,
the greatest range being shown by Ajmere and the next greatest by Ranikhet ; but
in July the variations over the mountains, which are always more or less moist
nd equable in temperature at this season, are very small, the ranges not exceeding
43 inch in the five years compared, while at Ajmere and Sutna they amount to
144 and ‘120 inch. In October, as we should expect from the fact of the mean
emperature of the month being about the average of the year, and the normal
tribution of pressure very uniform at all levels, the range of the variation is less
an in any of the other three, and is greatest at Hazaribagh, which, during the first
half of the month, is on the border of the region where the rains still penetrate after
they have ceased in Upper India, while it also lies near the track of some of the
October cyclones. The great variability of pressure at 10,000 feet over Central India and Rajputana
during the rainy season, which depends chiefly upon the still greater variability of
temperature in the same region, is a good instance of the general tendency for any
established set of meteorological conditions to persist by the interaction of cause and
effect. An unusually high pressure in the upper atmosphere over this region in the
months of May and June probably produces, as we have seen, westerly and north-
esterly winds ; these, being dry winds, neither cool the earth’s surface by precipitation
nd subsequent evaporation, nor, by the interposition of a screen of clouds, prevent its
temperature from rising high in the day-time ; then, in consequence of the high day
temperature in this region as compared with the Himalayas, which are more or less
‘loudy and moist, the pressure at 10,000 feet or other high levels remains relatively
excessive ; and again, in consequence of the high barie gradient thus conserved, the
westerly winds continue to blow on, until some disturbance originating at a distance
supervenes, or, as in 1877, until after the autumnal equinox, when the night begins
to exceed the day in length, and the loss of heat by radiation to the clear sky over-
balances the gain.
