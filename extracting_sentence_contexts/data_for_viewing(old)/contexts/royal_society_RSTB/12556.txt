'We thank Giosué Baggio for the phrasing we co-opt here.

?Two centuries later, medieval Indian Vedic scholar Kumarila Bhafta
further formulated a compositional view of semantics for sentences
called abhihitinvaya, or the ‘theory of words in relation’ (see [12]).
Here, we refer to a hypothetical case where the meaning of store or
Jane changed as a function of whether the word functioned as a sub-
ject or object or as the agent or patient of a verb, and not to the fact
that lexical items can have multiple senses (see [22]) and that the lex-
ical meanings can take on different senses in different contexts (e.g.,
fuzzy logic versus fuzzy penguin). Nor do we deny the fact that both
words and composed structures can vary in their meaning as a
function of context. Our claim is that the system cannot lose
access to Jane and store; they must be separable from Jane goes to
the store.

“However, the meaning of the phrase need not keep the word
meanings constant after they are composed (via whatever oper-
ator) into a phrase. For example, fuzzy can change its sense
based on the noun it modifies (e.g., fuzzy(penguin) versus fuzzy(-
logic) (see [22]), but this change of sense does not imply that the
system no longer has access to the two senses or meaning rep-
resentations of fuzzy.
