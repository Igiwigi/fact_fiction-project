Investigations on isolated muscles (Hill
& Meyerhof 1923) and on heart-lung preparations (Cruickshank & Startup 1933) showed
that unless special precautions were taken the R.Q. was near to unity, and Buchwald &
Cori (1931) as well as Gemmill (1940) were unable to demonstrate any decrease in the fat
content of mammalian muscles when stimulated electrically in situ, whereas glycogen
disappeared. In the latter investigations, however, it must be borne in mind that the
amount of fat which might have been used could only constitute about sqg9 of the total
content of the body, and later investigations (see below) have shown that some muscles
can make use of fat. The evidence for considering fat as an inferior fuel used in case of emergency does not
find support in the fact that it constitutes the main energy reserve in most animals and,
moreover, some of the above effects are not necessarily associated with the combustion of
fat as such. For example, training can increase the ability to work on a fat diet (Krogh
& Lindhard 1920; Hansen 1942), and the ingestion of sugar need not increase the r.g. of
an exhausted person, although it immediately restored the ability to work, hypoglycaemia
rather than the type of combustion causing the fatigue (Christensen & Hansen 19394).

It is well established that proper functioning of the central nervous system depends on
a high blood-sugar concentration, and glucose is therefore a necessary nutrient in the
body as a whole.
