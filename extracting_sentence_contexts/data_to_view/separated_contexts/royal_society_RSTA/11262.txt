A/B or B/A as a method of prediction. We may, in fact, at once dismiss all
reconstruction formule as insufficient which are not based on the theory of corre-
lution. The theory as here applied, be it noted, depends on the linearity of the
proposed formula and not on any special form of the distribution of variations.

(ii.) The accuracy of a prediction will not be indefinitely increased by increasing
the number of organs upon which the prediction is based. This fundamental fact of
the application of the theory of correlation to prediction has already been noticed by
Miss Anice Lee and myself in the case of barometric prediction.* The choice of
organs upon which to base the prediction is far more important.
