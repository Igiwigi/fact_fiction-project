In EÂ£. divisicolur (fig. 11) the outgrowths consisted chiefly of hypertrophied
spongy parenchyma. The cells were in uninterrupted connection, and therefore
formed a marked contrast to the particularly loose structure of the normal spongy
parenchyma.

In Vitis vinifera spontaneously occurring outgrowths have been described by
Soravgr. In the intumescences induced artificially, in my experiments, the tissue
affected was the spongy parenchyma, which grew into a kind of pseudo-palisade
(fig. 12). The epidermal cells only became very slightly enlarged, and were not
broken through by the underlying tissues. Probably this fact is to be explained by
the small size of the outgrowths formed, as SoravER* notes that, in the cases
he noticed, the epidermis was ruptured. Again, the small size of the intumescences
appears to be due to the fact that they were developed slowly, on leaves which were
not growing actively. No oil, starch, nor any abnormal substance was observed in the
cells. Later their walls became brownish.

Pelargonium (Dibrachya). The outgrowths in the ivy-leaved geranium were
found to consist chiefly of hypertrophied mesophyll. The young intumescences were
pale green ; in the older ones the outer parts were corky. The cells contained little
or no oil.

Not only are there differences between the intumescences of the same type in
different plants, but on the same species of plant grown under different conditions.
This was shown by an examination and comparison of the outgrowths artificially
induced on the leaves of Hibiscus vitifolius grown under the different conditions
