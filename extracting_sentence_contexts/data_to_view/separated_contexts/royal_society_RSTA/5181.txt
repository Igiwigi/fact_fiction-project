(9, + 9,)/dé? = «d*9,/da*, showing that the

relation of the average disturbance of the molecule to the disturbance of the «ther is there introduced
mply by means of an experimental number, the specific inductive capacity of the medium. The
correlative mechanical hypothesis would require us, not to anchor a massive core of the molecule in space,
but to introduce a coefficient to express the ratio of the displacement of the molecule to the displacement
of the medium on some appropriate kind of equilibrium theory,—thus in fact to directly Joad the ether,
nd refer only the variable part of dispersion to the free periods of the molecule; but such an idea would
troduce all kinds of difficulties with respect to the kinetic theory of gases and material motions in
general. “In the electric theory these difficulties are evaded by the principle that the inertia of matter

different in kind from the inertia of wther; the one is subject to electromagnetic forcive, the other
to electromotive forcive. The recent discovery of an upper limit beyond which radiations that can travel in a vacuum do not
travel across air, has an important bearing on the present subject.
