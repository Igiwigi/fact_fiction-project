we must conclude that too small a proportion of alloy was pre-
sent in both cases; for this appears to be very probable, from
the general result of the whole of the preceding experiments.*
Some such cause of error must have therefore prevailed, in the
two first cases of standard gold contained in the foregoing
. Table; and.it is absolutely necessary that this should be strongly
pointed out, lest any one should fall into a mistaken notion,
which has but too commonly been received in this country, and
which has injuriously and unjustly been believed on the Conti-
nent, to the detriment of the British Exchange. The erroneous
idea to which I allude is, the belief that the standard gold of the
present reign is inferior to those which have preceded it; the
real fact is, however, precisely the reverse, as the following
extract, from the Report of Messrs. GaRBETTs to the Lords of
the Treasury, in 1782, will sufficiently prove.

® It is very probable, that the alloy was as much too abundant, in many similar
pieces of the same coinage, as it was deficient in those here mentioned ; for, it is certain,
that the gold coins of Jamss 11, and of Cnaruss Il, were, in the aggregate, much
inferior to the present standard, as the annexed extract from Messrs. GaRBETTs'

Report vufficiently evinces,
