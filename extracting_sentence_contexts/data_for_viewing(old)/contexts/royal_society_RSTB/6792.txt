generally adopted as the most convenient, as well as the least committal, of its
synonyms, and it is the one which will be adhered to in this paper.

Smith drew attention to the variation in virulence of the symptoms exhibited
by the virus infection he then called tobacco ringspot, induced by the inoculation
of the juice of a potato suffering from what appeared to be simple mosaic.

Smith (1929a) records that when transmitting ‘“‘virulent ringspot’’ by needle to
tobacco, as many as one plant in six might develop the “‘non-virulent” form of ring-
spot, that passage of this altered virus through several generations of tobaccos did
not further alter its character, and that he regarded this as a definite attenuation of
the virus resulting from the original passage. In the light of Smith’s later work the
correct explanation is to be found in the fact that in certain needle transmissions one of
the components of the original complex, viz. Y, which together with X produced what
he then termed the virulent form of ringspot, had dropped out, leaving the X virus to
infect the plant, and that it was this virus which was conveyed unaltered by further
needle inoculation.

Smith (19294) further observed an alteration of symptoms resulting from progressive
passage of “‘ringspot or intensified mosaic” in the opposite direction, viz. that of an
intensification of virulence. In this case he was undoubtedly dealing with a mixture
of X and Y and was unconsciously selecting in favour of the complex which contained
one of the more virulent forms of the X virus shortly to be described.

Later, Smith (1933) recognized that the X virus alone might exhibit a variation in
