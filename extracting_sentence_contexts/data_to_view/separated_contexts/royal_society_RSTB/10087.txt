Or does
experience-driven cortical self-organization result in columnar
organization only in specific areas in which this wiring strategy
is optimal? In order to focus efforts using MRI to investigate
such questions, a deeper understanding of cortical functional
anatomy, based on animal studies and post-mortem human
brain histology, would be helpful.
