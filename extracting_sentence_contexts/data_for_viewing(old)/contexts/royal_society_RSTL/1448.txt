The method of analysis which I adopted, in examining the
several varieties of muriate of soda, was as follows,

When the salt was in a state of solution, a measured quantity
was evaporated to dryness in a sand heat, which was carefully
regulated, to avoid the decomposition of the muriate of mag-
nesia, if any of that salt were present in the solution,*

gravity of the same salt may be occasioned by a variation in its state of crystallization-

* Muriate of magnesia, according to Dr. Mar cer, begins to part with its acid at
a temperature a few degrees aboye that of boiling water. This fact explains the ob-
Servation of Mr. Kirwan, that too great a heat, employed in the desiccation of
muriate of magnesia, decreases, considerably its solubility in- alcohol. (Kixwan on
Mineral Waters, p. 275-)

Each specimen of salt was reduced to a fine powder, and
was dried, in the temperature of 180% of Fanrexntr, during
the space of two hours. This was done in order that the
different experiments might be made on precisely equal quan-
tities of salt,
