is well shown in the fibres of the leg of the common Blue Bottle Fly (Musca vomi-
toria) after the addition of a weak acid. In insects, the nuclei are very often visible
in the fibre without any previous preparation. I have sometimes distinctly observed
them in fibres from the leg of the Tipula, and in many other examples,

The fibres next increase in length and the nuclei separate; the nuclei remain no
longer in close contact ; small intervals appear between them, and as they have more
space they increase in width and become more nearly circular. The spaces between
the nuclei rapidly widen, until at last they lie at a very considerable distance apart.
At the same time the fibre decreases very considerably in diameter, and the cause of
this is sufficiently obvious. As the nuclei part from each other and as the spaces
between them increase, the bands which they separated fall in, â€”approach each other
and ultimately coalesce*. This fact is placed beyond doubt by the examination of
some fibres in which these changes are in progress, Plate X. fig. 8. At one extre-
mity of a fibre may be seen the oval nuclei packed closely together, and bordered at
their extremities by the substance of the fibre; further on they may be seen sepa-
rating and becoming rounder, the bands at the same time are beginning to approxi-

* For example, in a specimen of muscular tissue from a fetal pig 34 inches long three fibres were measured.
In the first the nuclei were almost in contact, and the width of the fibre was 357th of an inch; in the econ
the nuelei were 557th of an inch apart, and the width of the fibre was 544;7; in the third the nuclei were
Tegpth of an inch apart, and the width of the fibre was 5755.
