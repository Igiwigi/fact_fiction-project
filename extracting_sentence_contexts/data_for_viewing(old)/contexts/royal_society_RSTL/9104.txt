Zeolour, the larger grained kinds tending to a somewhat violet grey, the finer to a
Sbluer and more slaty hue. They are by no means hard in texture; some of them
Eire compact, others more or less yesicular, and occasionally carry zeolitic minerals,
Sor aragonite.
SZ Viewed microscopically, the white felspar is seen to be mottled with dark grey
minerals, among which conspicuous erystals of orange-yellow Olivine stand out,
Sand are generally decomposed to a considerable degree, and here and there small
grains of magnetite can be recognised.

In thin sections these dolerites of coarser grain present in the mieroscope a
beautiful assemblage of interlaced felspar crystals, which in polarised light exhibit
the twinned and ribboned stripes that characterise the anorthic felspars. This felspar
is in fact Labradorite. That it is 80 is confirmed by the analysis of the erystals
picked with great care from the erushed rock; a specimen quite characteristic in
its felspar being selected from those from the river Palmiste.

Tn some of these dolerites, as in that from Wount Grenade and from Pitou, the
crystals of felspar are long and blade-like in form, while in those from some of the
other localities the crystals are comparatively short in proportion to their length ;
