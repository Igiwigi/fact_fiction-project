It appears, therefore, from these experiments that it is an equal chance that the true

value sought of the ratio R lies between the values 2:01 and 1:97. The value of this
Qratio indicated by chemical theory is 2; the preceding experiments, therefore, entirely
Qagree with this theory. We may also infer, from the calculated value 0-11 of the error
Sof a single experiment, that if we should proceed to make another experiment by the
ISsame method it is an equal chance that the value of Rin that experiment will lie between
=the values 1-88 and 2-10; and half the values of R found by the preceding observations
Should le between the same limits. As a matter of fact, out of these 33 experiments
817 experiments are within these limits, and 16 experiments are outside these limits.
ZThe experiments, therefore, are in perfect accordance with the calculated value of the
"Zprobable error of a ingle result.
2 These experiments are fully confirmed by certain experiments of Mn1s8NERÂ® previously
referred to, which really throw great light upon the subject, although this chemist has the
-Sart of singularly misinterpreting his results. The object of the experiments was to effect,
Ba comparison between the weight of a volume of oxygen equal to the contraction of the
Selectrized gas and the increment of weight of a solution of iodide of potassium, acidulated
Swith sulphuric acid, when the same electrized gas was passed through the solution. The
Scontraction was (as I understand the experiment) estimated by comparing the volume of
_the oxygen before and after its passage through the induction-tube, which was an induc-
Stion-tube of the form devised by Von BaBo; the weight corresponding to this contraction
