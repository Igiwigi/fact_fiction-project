With neither do I assume
any particular stay as a point of departure, in preference to
the rest; but, on the contrary, every star in its turn is
assumed as' a point of reference to the others; thus endea-
vouring, in the first instance, to establish their relative dis-
tances from each other on the equator, or meridian, leaving
the choice and determination of some common point of
departure as a subject for future consideration. To render this more easily intelligible, perhaps it would be
better to consider each instrument separately.


408 Mr. PoxD on the different methods of

Whoever attentively examines the construction of the
mural circle at Greenwich, will perceive that its operation is
entirely limited to the measurement of the meridional distance
between different stars, It is, in fact, a theodolite placed
vertically. By an extension of its principle, it can measure
the distance between a star and its reflected image from a
mercurial horizon, and thus determine the altitude of a-star ;
and, in common with every other circle, it can measure the
distance of a circumpolar star from the pole by an observation
of its inferior and superior passage over the meridian. As
the instrument cannot be reversed, a plumb line could not
be applied, with any advantage.
