However, if we view the corresponding wavelet transform modulus
(figure 1d), we may observe a very obvious white band snaking across the transform plane. This
band indicates where most of the energy of the original signal is contained in time and frequency
and we can see that the characteristics of the signal are now displayed in highly resolved detail:
the general frequency drift is evident, increasing over time and the frequency modulation is
obvious from oscillatory nature of the band. In fact, the ridge of the band (shown as a black line
superimposed on the band maxima) may be used to extract the instantaneous frequency of the
signal component relatively easily by projecting this ridge vertically (figure le). This new signal
