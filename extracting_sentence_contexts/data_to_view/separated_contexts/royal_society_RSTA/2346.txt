without the application of external tension (see note above on hedgehog
spines). On transferring the fibres from the solution to pure water, the longitudinal
swelling subsided and was replaced by an increased lateral swelling. It is obvious, if only from these brief notes, that the problem of the interaction of
Na,S and the keratins is one of extraordinary interest and no little complexity ; in
fact, one may safely say that it is the problem of the structure of the keratins them-
selves. It would be indefensible at this stage to rush to hasty conclusions, but it is
hard to resist the suggestion that the liberation by Na,S of free —S—S— and —SH.,
the sudden intensification by the same reagent of the @-phase or of some close derivative,
the similarity in spacing and intensity between the chief reflection of cystine and that
of the @-phase, and the crystallographic deduction that this spacing is very likely the
half-length of the cystine molecule, are all aspects of one and the same structural feature,
that in the 8-form of the keratins there are molecular chains linked side-to-side by molecules
of cystine or cysteine. In the later stages of the reaction between stretched hair and sodium sulphide
it would seem that the molecular chains, themselves, are also ruptured, with the

consequence that some of the §-phase, relieved of tension, reverts once more to the
a-phase ; but because there has been such a destruction of protein in the body of the
fibre, the original alignment of the erystallites is lost.
