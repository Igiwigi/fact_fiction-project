108. 1t is clear that if, instead of finding as above the expression of the Supplement,
Ithe value of (4Z)(1),=n(4Z - )+m(4Z/), had been taken as known, then the equation

Swould have led to iy
2 Supp.(42)(D=m{2(4Z - )—(4Z/)) +#(4% - );

Sand this, as in fact already remarked, is the course of treatment employed in the re-
Zmaining cases. It is to be observed also that the equation may for shortness be written

Lin the form
=

5 (42) {(1)—2A(2m—V(D} _
= + Supp. (1)=(TI)2D ;
