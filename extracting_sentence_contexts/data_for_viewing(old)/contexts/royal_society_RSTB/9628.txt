Figure 2. Overview of cultivation-independent approaches used to reconstruct microbial genomes. Schematic chart displays steps involved in cultivation-independent
methods to characterize microbial dark matter. TNF, tetranucleotide frequency; ESOM, emergent self-organizing map; MDA, multiple-strand displacement amplification;
FACS, fluorescent activated cell-sorting.
