Owing to the
much smaller cross-section of the edge of the device than the absorbing area, significant optical
gain can be achieved, while the field of view follows the cosine law. The experimental result
shown in figure 8d demonstrates that these devices can provide much wider field-of-view when
compared with lenses with similar optical gains (figure 8d). This is a consequence of the fact that
the angle of emitted light is independent from the angle of incident light, and the conservation of
Ã©tendue between the incident and the emitted light does not apply. The two experimental publications [84,85] followed rather different approaches for the
implementation of the fluorescent antennas. Manousiadis et al. [36] demonstrated devices with
a slab geometry, while Peyronel et al. [85] used optical fibres to construct fluorescent antennas.
