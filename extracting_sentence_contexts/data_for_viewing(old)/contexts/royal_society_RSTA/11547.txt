the potential used the transparency curve would be not very far from a straight line.

Fhe Initial Steepening of the Logarithmic Curves.—The early steeper portion of each
q logarithmic curve of transmission when radiator and screen are alike has been noticed
o(figs. 7,8,and 9). The extent of the steepening depends on the material of the screen.
P An explanation which suggests itself is that the effect is due to the presence,
‘gin the radiation, of a certain amount of soft rays. If this were the cause, however, we
should be able to eliminate the preliminary rapid decrease by placing between the
aluminium window of the tube and the screen a sheet of some other metal thick
cee to remove all the soft rays. This was tried with several metals, but always

with the same result. Beyond small changes in the gradients no alteration in the
Eshape of the curve was produced, and the kink still remained. In fact, if one
vradually builds up a composite screen of a number of different metals, the logarithmic
‘curve of transmission consists of a series of discontinuous steps made up of an initially
“Bsteep and a subsequently flatter portion for each metal.

It is clear that the results are not due to the presence of any soft radiation, but we
‘Bean find a ready explanation of the earlier steepness in the curves if we consider the
“geffects of secondary radiation. At every stage the primary radiation transmitted by
Ba screen is augmented by a certain amount of secondary radiation (in part softer
than the primary) from the screen itself. For simplicity, let us consider the case of
Zhomogeneous primary rays. With thick screens none of the secondary radiation
£ emerging on the far side of the screen comes from below a certain depth of the screen ;
© that proceeding from greater depths is absorbed. Thus, in this region, the transmitted
