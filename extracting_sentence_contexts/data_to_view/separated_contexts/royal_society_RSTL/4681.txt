There are six eye-tubes that can be used with the micro-
meter, with powers varying from 85 to 820, but the power almost invariably used in
the observations about to be described was 450; one of 320, and sometimes a lower
power, was occasionally, but very rarely, employed, and when this occurs a notice to
that effect will be found in the Table containing the results of observations subjoined. The telescope is provided with a clock-work motion ; the performance of the object-
glass, 80 far as its powers have been tested, leaves nothing to be desired, but the
mounting of the telescope, notwithstanding the precautions above mentioned, does
not appear to be equally steady with that of some other recently erected equatoreals,
Whenever the night admitted of it, ten measures both in position and distance were
obtained of each object observed ; when in the sequel I speak of a set of obseryations,
the term is to be understood as applying to all the observations of a single night,
which almost always comprised that number of measures both of position and
distance. To each individual measure, whether of position or distance, an arbitrary
weight was assigned, and registered at the time of making it, the number 10 being
supposed to express a result with which the observer was entirely satisfied, and

smaller numbers to denote a less degree of confidence in the value obtained; in

point of fact, however, no higher number than 8 seerms to have been used, and the

weights employed generally range from 4 to 7. The sum of the weights of the indi-

vidual measures, or the weight of the set, has been divided by 10 prior to its entry in
the subjoined tables; while therefore the number 5 should express the weight of a
set, of average goodness, the number expressive of that weight is reduced in practice
to 4. The measures when made are registered in the printed skeleton forms, origi-
nally proposed by Sir Joux Herscner, and adopted, I believe, by almost all observers
of double stars in this country.
