[> PROFESSOR SCHOENBEIN ON SPONTANEOUS NITRIFICATION. 139

Now, if a nitrate happens to be formed in treating, for instance, hydrate of lime
| with ozonized atmospheric air, it seems to follow that the nitric acid formed under
those cireumstances, owes, in some way or other, its origin to. 0zone, pure atmo-
spheric air being unable to produce a nitrate with the hydrate named; But in what
manner does ozone contribute to the formation of that acid? My experiments have
shown that ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent, s0 much s0, that even iodine
and silver are at the common temperature transformed into iodic acid and peroxide
of silver. If it be a fact that the chemical powers of the oxygen contained in 0zone
| are 80 much exalted as to enable that oxygen to unite with substances $0 little
oxidable as iodine and silver are, it would not appear in my eyes very Surprising
I if that same oxygen $should happen to combine, under certain circumstances, with ni-
S trogen to form what is called nitric acids.
S According to my opinion (see my little work on the Slow and Rapid Combustion
=> of Bodies) there does not exist a compound of nitrogen =NO,, I consider what
chemists call the first hydrate of nitric acid as NO, + HO,, and the normal nitrates
2 as NO,+RO,. Nitrate of lime is therefore to me NO,+CaOz. Agreeable to that
Ss view, Iam inclined to account for the nitrification above mentioned in the following
& manner. Ozone transforms first CaO into CaO,, a change which, according to my
Â© recent experiments, a number of basic oxides undergo within an ozonized atmo-
= &phere. The oxides of manganese, lead, cobalt, nickel, and silyer, for instance, are
