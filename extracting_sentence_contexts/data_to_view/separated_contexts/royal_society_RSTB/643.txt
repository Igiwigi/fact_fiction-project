No incoordination is produced in the action of the remaining muscular
combinations.

3. There is no evidence of overflow of the impulses which ought to travel down the
divided root, into other channels through the spinal centres so as to reach the muscles
by new paths.

4, Degeneration Method.

1. These experiments confirm the anatomical facts that had been previously
ascertained by dissection, as to which nerve roots supply any given nerve with
fibres.

2. The degeneration which results in the nerves is not a scattered one, but is
localized to distinct bundles of nerve fibres occupying a certain position in the
transverse section of the nerve.

3. The Wallerian law of degeneration, so far as it is applied to the nerve roots and
their intervertebral ganglia, is found to be erroneous, for when a nerve root is divided
on the distal side of the intervertebral ganglion not only is degeneration found in
the peripheral end of such a root, but also in that portion of the sensory root between
the ganglion and the spinal cord; pointing to the probability that there are certain _
nerve fibres which do not depend on the ganglion for their trophic supply, but

derive the same from elsewhere, either the spinal cord at another level, or the
periphery.
