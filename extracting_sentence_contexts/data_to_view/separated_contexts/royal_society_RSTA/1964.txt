If D() be as found, i.e., (—4,)8(),
v, will be increased by “09 or 786°45 to 786'54—an inappreviable change. To produce
a change of 2 in the value of 6b or », the limit would have to be (—5d)S,(), which
gives a value 88°5 above S(o). But, as a fact, the limit found is quite close to
§,(). This explanation is therefore excluded. (3) Are these displacements on the d sequences?
