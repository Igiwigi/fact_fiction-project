*8econd spine,' with a prolongation of the scapula below, characterizes that bone in the
Anteaters, this indication of affinity to Myrmecophaga, or rather manifestation of the
more general characters of the order Bruta, by the Megatherium, is not without interest.

Mammals.
© Clavicle.—Before the discovery of the Megatherium, Man was usually cited in Manuals
of Comparative Anatomy as the largest animal possessing a * collar-bone”: he is; in fact,
- the largest existing animal 80 endowed. But whilst the length of the human clavicle
- averages but 6 inches, that of the Megatherium is 15 inches. In its general shape and *
- 8igmoid curve, this bone (Plate XX. tig. 1) singularly resembles the human clavicle,
- but is thicker in proportion to its length. No single bone would have better excused
the common conclusion of the medizeval anatomists as to the nature of large fossil bones,
viz. that they were those of human giants, than the collar-bone of the Megatherium.
hy The sternal end is expanded, obliquely truncate, with a rough, irregular, undulating,
abut mainly convex articular surface, much fitted for strong ligamentous attachment to
Sthe manubrium sterni, and with a narrow, rather flattened facet above this surface,
Swhere it abuts against the same part in its fellow, as shown at Plate XVIII. «.
