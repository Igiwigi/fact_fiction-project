Sept. 20, 1778
Re DANS, VERY eminent ſurgeon at Cheſter has
1778,

deſired me to tranſmit the incloſed
caſe to the Royal Society, and I hope it will be deemed
worthy of publication, It not only affords a confirmation
of an important fact inſerted in the Philoſophical Tran-
ſactions, vol. LIX. art. v1.; but ſhews alſo that the chi-
rurgical improvement, propoſed in that article by my
ingenious friend Mr. CHARLEs WHITE, may be extended
to operations on other parts of the human body,

Tam, &c;

A FRIEND
