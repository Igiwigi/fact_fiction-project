The mechanisms of evolution, in particular, have been one of the most controversial issues
in biology and the great debate about them culminated, in the 1930s and 1940s, in the modern
synthesis, the theoretical framework where natural selection is regarded as virtually the sole
mechanism of evolutionary change. But where does natural selection come from? Let us start from the fact that the copying of the genes is the elementary act that leads to
heredity. When the process of copying is repeated indefinitely, however, another phenomenon
comes into being. Copying mistakes becomes inevitable and in a world of limited resources not
all changes can be implemented, which means that a process of selection is bound to take place.
