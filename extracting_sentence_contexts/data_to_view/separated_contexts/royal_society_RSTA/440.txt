Finally, ยง5 is devoted to various
numerical experiments, which allow one to recover the steady distribution of wealth and
knowledge in the population for various choices of the relevant parameters.

2. An evolutionary model for knowledge

Even if a well-established definition of knowledge does not exist, and there are numerous
theories to explain it, one can agree on certain universal aspects about it. Knowledge can be
described as familiarity with someone or something unknown, which can include information,
facts, descriptions or skills acquired through experience or education. It is commonly accepted
that knowledge is in part influenced strongly by ones parents, but it is evident that the main
factor that can influence knowledge is the environment in which an individual grows up and
lives [43]. Indeed, the experiences that produce knowledge cannot be fully inherited from ones
parents, such as the genome, but rather are acquired over a lifetime from several elements of the
environment.
