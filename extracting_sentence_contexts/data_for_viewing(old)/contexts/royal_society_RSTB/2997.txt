cub. centims per hour.

The volume passing through 230,000 tracheides (assuming all to be filled with
water) at a rate of 11°7 centims. per hour, would be 30°42 cub, centims. per hour,
nearly seven times as much as that actually observed.

According to the viscosity calculation, however, 35 cub. centims. per hour or
seven and a-half times the actual amount should escape under the conditions given
from the tracheides of the alburnum when completely filled with water.

Section 5.—Discussion of Foregoing Results and Test Experiments.

Two facts stand out prominently in the foregoing calculations. Firstly, the fact
that the amount of flow calculated from the rate of flow is, except in the case of the
elder, always greater than the actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the
amount of flow as calculated from PorseurLue’s formula is from 7-300 times the actual
flow, the difference becoming greater as the diameter of the conducting vessels
increases.

The explanation of the first point is simple. The method used gives the maximal
rate of flow, and not the average rate, and, further, the calculation is based on
the assumption that all the vessels are equally active in the conveyance of water,
and that all of them are completely filled with water. Using two- to three-year old
stems of the apple and pear in which the whole of the wood was in the alburnum
condition, it was found that the rate of ascent of sap, as measured by placing
