g. It is believed by many, that the small portions of serous
fluid which are found after death in the cavities of serous
membranes, especially in the pericardium and the ventricles
of the brain, may have been poured out after the cessation of
life. | I'am not aware that this opinion is other than hypo-

thetical, or that it 'is supported by any precise facts. As a
theoretical conelusion its correctness seems doubtful, TI have
endeavoured to put it to the test of experiment, and the re-
sult has not been favourable to it. I have notes of three dif-
ferent experiments on dogs, which were made in Ceylon in
1818, all which seem to show that, under ordinary circum-
stances, no effusion of serum, or exudation $0 as to occasion
accumulation, takes place after death.
