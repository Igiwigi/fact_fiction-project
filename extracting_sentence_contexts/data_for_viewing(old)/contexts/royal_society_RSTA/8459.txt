for any appreciable currents to result from these electromotive forces, but in certain
higher regions the conductivity rises to a sufficiently high value for currents to flow
and to manifest themselves by their magnetic field, which is observed as the lunar
diurnal magnetic variation. The external situation of the primary part of the field of
L (§ 23, ii) is thus explained.

The theory as thus outlined is similar to that developed by Barrour Srewarr and
Scuuster to explain the solar diurnal magnetic variation 8. It is probable that the
convective motion responsible for § is semidiurnal also, being associated with the well-
known semidiurnal variation of the barometer.

Both L and § are more intense during the hours of daylight than during the dark
hours, a fact which is readily explained as due to the conductivity of the atmosphere,
at the level where the currents flow, being the greater when the air is exposed to some
ionising ultra-violet component of the solar radiation.

The marked differences between L and S.

§ 25. A discussion* of L and S along the lines indicated in § 24 showed that the theory
was capable of accounting for a great many features of the two phenomena ; never-
theless, some serious difficulties (loc. cit. § 26) remained. At that time it was not known
