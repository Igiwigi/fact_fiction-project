The distal end of the rads
gives no indication of having supported two bones ; while on the outer distal
of the scapho-lunar is a distinct facet which seems to correspond in size and ,
with the central bone which is below it. It is, I think, unnecessary to discuss Professor BARDELEBEN’S views furthe
this character of the carpus, because I have obtained new evidence of the sti
of the carpus in allied animals (p. 36; Plate 2, fig. 17), with the bones united by
in other genera, demonstrating three bones in the proximal row. And this seemso
me confirmatory of the interpretation which I originally offered, since I ama
no fact tending to a different conclusion. i
Professor BARDELEBEN, however, proposed to obtain an additional bone

The bone which I have regarded as the innermost central bone,
BARDELEBEN’s nomenclature is the pre-pollex.
