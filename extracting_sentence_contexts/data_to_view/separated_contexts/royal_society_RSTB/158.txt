Even a large Torpedo may give a response of short duration, but the response in
such cases is always small in amount, and is, in fact, minimal. Apart from the necessary effect of the vigour of the organ, there is that of the size
of the fish, and so of the columns. The larger the fish, other things being equal, the
longer the duration of what must be considered as the true response.
