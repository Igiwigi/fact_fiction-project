On looking at Bazinâ€™s formula
it will be seen that this is due to the fact that the sea is deep. In order that the
roughness of the bottom may. have a large effect in slowing down a stream, it is
necessary that 7 should be small. It seems, in fact, that the size of the projections
which constitute the roughness or inequality of the bed must be some definite fraction
of v in order that their effect may be felt on the stream as a whole. In other words,
the direct effect of the projections extends to a distance which is some multiple of
the linear dimension of the projections ; and if these are small enough compared with
the depth, very little difference is made to the total flow of the stream by changing
the amount of roughness on-the bottom. This conclusion is important in the present application, because it means that by
adopting the values of K given above we shall be able to get a fairly accurate
estimate of the friction of the sea on the bottom without knowing the exact nature
of the bottom.
