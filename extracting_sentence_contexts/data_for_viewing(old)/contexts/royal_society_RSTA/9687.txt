DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. $7

in fact, they only observed the triplet S(2), 8, (3), S.(8) of the next and 8, (4)—too
few to give the series. The triplet $(1) was observed first by Lenmann* (more
accurately later by Hermann‘) and the series completed and arranged by SaunvErs.}
The first three are only sufficient to determine the constants with « only; in the
analogous cases of Mg, Ca, and Sr the limits so determined have all come out too
large. Here it makes the calculated values of wave numbers for 8, (4) and §, (5)
differ from those assigned by SauNDERS by amounts too large respectively by 71 and
159—in other words, the limits here, also, are much too large if his allocations are
correct. If we use his allocation of 8, (4) and attempt to find constants for 8m-* we
get a formula quite out of line with the others. The first impression is to infer that
SaunpDERS’ allocation of the two last lines is quite wrong, but a closer acquaintance
with other series gives more caution and suggests another way of meeting the
difficulty. As a fact, it is difficult to represent all the P series, and especially the
