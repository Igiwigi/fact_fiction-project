'= Hence if in addition to photographs on ordinary plates a series of photographs be
ken with a colour screen on a plate sensitized for red-yellow rays another formula
Svould be found which should lead (see last section) to the same number of particles
r unit volume as that belonging to blue-violet radiation. Two such series of
hotographs, together with observations of the light polarised at various distances,
ead thus decide the debated question whether the luminosity is actually caused by
Thinute particles which are heated to luminescence by solar radiation and which
scatter sunlight. (b) Though it is a fact that the brightness of the corona undergoes changes, we are
ignorant whether the intensity of the corona at a certain distance in terms of that at
unit distance is a constant or not. Inferences might be drawn from data such as
contained in this paper and belonging to a series of eclipses which would advance our
knowledge of the constitution of the corona and give us some idea of the causes which
produce it. It is, of course, necessary that the plates have on all occasions the same
relative sensitiveness in the different regions of the spectrum.
