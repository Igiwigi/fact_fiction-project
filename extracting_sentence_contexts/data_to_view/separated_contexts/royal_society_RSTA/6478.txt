Tiorr’s apparatus ; in each
case the negative rotation is slight before the neutral point is reached, while the
positive rotation observed after neutrality increases rapidly in each case, until it

“eventually far exceeds the original movement. In conclusion, I think I may consider as established by these experiments the
following results :— :

1. The broad facts of rotation as observed by M. THore are abundantly confirmed.

2. The numerous experiments in which the face and hot water are tested under the
same circumstances, and especially Experiments 46 and 47, prove that the action is
due to radiation alone.
