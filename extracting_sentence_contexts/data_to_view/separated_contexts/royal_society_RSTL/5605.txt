MR. A. CAYLEY'S FOURTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 419

69. To take the simplest example, in seeking for the covariants of a single quantic U,
we in fact have to consider two quantics U, V. An expression such as 12 UV is a lineo-
linear covariant of the two quantics; its developed expression is

Wm 2,U.9,V—2,U.d.V,

which i is the Jacobian. In the particular case of two linear functions (a, 6Xz, y) and
(, UYz, y), the lineo-linear covariant becomes the lineo-linear invariant a'—a'b, which
is the Jacobian of the two linear functions. In the example we cannot descend from the two quantics U, V to the single quantic
I (for putting V=U the covariant vanishes); but this is merely accidental, as appears
Sy considering a different lineo-linear covariant 12*UV, the developed expression of
