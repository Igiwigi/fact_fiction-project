It will be seen
that the data points owing to impact with the 1mm diameter glass spheres lie distinctly above
those owing to impact with the steel spheres. This means that for the same impact velocity
the semi-included angle of the Hertzian cone crack is smaller for a steel sphere impact than
for a glass sphere impact. This observation is consistent with the fact that for the same impact
velocity the loading rate for the steel projectiles will be greater than with the glass projectiles,
and, consequently, there will be a greater reduction in the value of Poissonâ€™s ratio for the steel
projectiles than will be the case for the glass projectiles. It may also be noted from figure 7 that, for
a given projectile impact velocity, the semi-included angle of the Hertzian cone produced in fused
silica with a 1mm diameter sapphire sphere is smaller than that produced with a glass projectile. The third aspect of this work concerns the total contact time during an impact and the lengths
of the cracks generated in different glasses.
