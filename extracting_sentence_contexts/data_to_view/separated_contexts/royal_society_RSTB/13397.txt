e-mail: jozsef-arato@univie.acat The fact that closely related species resemble one another in form is a funda-

mental insight in evolutionary biology [1-3], and the realization that the
same is often true of behavioural patterns was foundational in the development
of ethology [4-6]. Vocalizations produced by a given species reflect both vocal
anatomy and behaviour, each of which may have strong heritable components. This suggests that homologous vocalizations of closely related species may
resemble each other more than pairs drawn at random—in other words that
vocalizations may possess ‘phylogenetic signal’.
