The topographs are very close to being mirror images of each
other. This suggests that the corresponding surfaces were originally coincident to one another in the same diamond and a cleave
has been made to separate them. The fact that the patterns are close to regular hexagons is consistent with a final cleavage being
made close to the centre of the stone. The mirror-like symmetry observed in the fluorescence topographs and the birefringence show
conclusively that the diamonds came from the same crystal from adjacent crystallographic planes;
they are mating surfaces. X-ray diffraction in the backscattering (Laue) geometry was carried out using a Photonic
Science intensified Laue X-ray imaging camera system with a Philips PW1830 X-ray generator
operating at 35kV and 35mA.
