Certain of their lines even exist only in the neighbourhood of the blue cone. It is
very probable that an examination of the relative lengths of the lines and of their
appearance would result in the determination of new series. In fact, in the spectrum
of the alkaline metals and of those metals whose flame spectra do contain known
series, a complete analogy is seen in the appearances of those lines whose wave-lengths
are connected with one another by some numerical relation. I have elsewhere (p. 160)
pointed out in the flame spectrum of chromium the presence of two triplets which
are probably members of the same series. If we now compare the flame spectra thus produced with those of the are and the
spark, it will be noticed that as a rule the lines which are found in the flame spectrum
are those which are the strongest lines in the are spectrum.
