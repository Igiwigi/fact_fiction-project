We shall now prove that if w, is chosen to maximise P, (w») under the condition
(72), then except perhaps for a set of values of ¢ of measure zero, the region w, (4) will
maximise
under the condition (91). That is to say, we shall prove that whatever be the (nm — 1)-
dimensioned region, say v (¢), being a part of the hypersurface ¢ = const. and satisfying

the condition

Suppose in fact that the proposition is not true and that there exists a set E of
values of ¢ of positive measure for which it is possible to define the regions v (¢)
satisfying (99), and such that

P, (7 (4)) = [| palais tas oo ty) dw (4),

Po (v ($)) = & Po (W ($)),
P, (v ($))
