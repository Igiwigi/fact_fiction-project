Such a hypothesis fits the facts and explains them as I
think no other present hypothesis does. It is not the possibility of mutation in the fungi (and bacteria) that is here denied,
but rather the compulsion to accept that interpretation of the evidence as it now
stands. As the facts present themselves to me, avenues of interpretation other than
that of mutation are still widely open.
