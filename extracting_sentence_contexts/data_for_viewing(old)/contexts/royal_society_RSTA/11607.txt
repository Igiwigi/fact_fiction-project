The difference when nitrogen is substituted for Air or Oxygen is exceedingly
small,

It cannot be assumed that the surface tension retains its ordinary value in drops
of such small radii, which are not great compared with molecular dimensions. We
know, in fact, from the behaviour of thin films, that it does not. These numbers
therefore can only be considered as giving a very rough approximation to the

absolute size of the water drops which would actually be in equilibrium in vapour of
the various degrees of supersaturation.

They furnish, however, a convenient means of expressing the relative efficiency of
the nuclei in helping condensation. Thus, the nuclei producing rain-like condensation
are equivalent in their effect on the condensation, to water drops of radii between
64 x 10-8 and 8:7 xX 10~® centim. There are, as we have seen, certainly not more
