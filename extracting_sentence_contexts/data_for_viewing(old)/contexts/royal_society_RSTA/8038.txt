whole of these investigations is the existence of an intramolecular transformation
considered to take place between a folded polypeptide chain-system (x-keratin) and one
in a fully-extended state (@-keratin) analogous to that found normally in the fibroin
crystallites of natural silk. Figs. 24, 25, Plate 8, are X-ray photographs of small
bundles of unstretched silk and stretched human hair, respectively, taken under similar
conditions with Cu Kz rays in a cylindrical camera of radius 3-98 em. (The hair was
stretched in steam to an extension of about 100%.) It will be seen that there is a
strong resemblance between the two photographs, in particular with regard to the
repetition of pattern parallel to the fibre axis. For silk the period in this direction is
about 7 A.,* while for B-keratin it is rather less, something between 6-7 and 6-8 A.t
(for the detailed description of the two keratin photographs, see I). It is not at all
probable—for keratin at least (see above)—that lengths such as these represent the true
period along a polypeptide chain-system, but are rather an expression of the fact that
in the simplest formulation of the fully-extended general chain :—
