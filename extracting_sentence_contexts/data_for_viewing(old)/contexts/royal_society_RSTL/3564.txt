occur in those fibres in which the lengthening appears delayed much beyond the
usual time, and until after the majority of the original nuclei have disappeared. (See
Plate XI. fig. 13.) In these cases nuclei in great abundance are often seen attached
to the sur≈øace of the fibre. They are frequently 80 abundant as to be absolutely in

contact, as if the same number of nuclei which would have attached themselves to
the fibre had it elongated; are now crowded together into the smaller space#.

From the period of its first formation, the substance of the fibre gradually increases
in strength and firmness as development advances. This fact is well illustrated in
fibres which have been preserved some time in different fluids. The more advanced
the development of the fibre, the less readily is its texture destroyed; therefore it is
much more difficult to preserve the fibres in their earlier period than in the later
stages of development. If fibres which are elongating, and in which the nuclei are
Separating, are kept for some time in a preservative liquid, and by-and-by examined,
it will be noticed, that while the structure of those fibres in which the nuclei have
Separated to a considerable extent is still perfect and distinct, the snbstance of those
in which the nuclei are $till in contact is broken up and confused ; and it will be
observed that there is a close correspondence between the extent to which the nuclei
are separated and the integrity of the fibre.

The rate of development of different fibres in the same musecle is by no means
