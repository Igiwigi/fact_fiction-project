On the completion of this stage of development the embryo has attained the full
morphological status of the gastrula. A. structural condition in Ornithorhynchus,
evidently requiring such an interpretation, formed the subject of a former brief
* communication by the present writers, published in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal
Society of London’ (’08). In that communication we showed that in the egg of Ornithorhynchus of
9-10 millims. in diameter there is to be found a knob-like thickening of the
cellular wall of the blastodermic vesicle, constituting a very definite ‘primitive
knot.” This knot possesses a very well-marked gastrulation-cavity (“ Mesoderm-
