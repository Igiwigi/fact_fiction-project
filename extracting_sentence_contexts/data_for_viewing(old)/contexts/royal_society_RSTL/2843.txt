What I bave to communicate in this second part of my memoir is of a much less
definite character than that which is given in the first part. From the nature of the
subject it in many cases necessarily consists of inferences rather than observed facts.
It relates chiefly to the ova of the batrachian reptiles, and is added here merely for
the purpose of throwing some light on the changes which take place in the yelk of
