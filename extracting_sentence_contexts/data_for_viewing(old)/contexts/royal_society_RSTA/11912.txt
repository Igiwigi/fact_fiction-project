7 ROTATION OF THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION OF LIGHT IN LIQUIDS. 639

_ A consideration of the differences between the observed and calculated values shows
that at high temperatures the agreement is far from satisfactory, and the fact that: at
30° and 40° the differences are large and positive, while at 48° the difference is large
and negative, proves that the form of the curve has been largely modified by this last
point. If this observation be neglected, the linear equation

Ye = Yo (1 — 001188)

gives a much better agreement than Browat’s parabolic expression, the mean differ-
eace being only + 2 parts in 1000. It would, therefore, appear that BronaT was
Rrdly justified in using his parabolic equation ; indeed, even apart from the fact that
tRe boiling-point of the carbon bisulphide used by him is 2° higher than those obtained
¥§ ourselves and the other observers quoted on p. 644, we think that the character of
ls experimental data scarcely warrants the acceptance of his equation as representing
