either adorned with a pattern, or else radiated, mottled or stippled with dark or metallic
colours in a most artistic manner.

In most frogs and toads the iris is brilliantly coloured, often golden as if dusted with
golden or bronze powder, thus giving it the appearance of old gold or Japanese lacquer.
This metallic lustre is due to the presence of tiny flakes of crystals of guanin, which is
deposited within the chromatophore cells. In the giant toad (Bufo marinus) the iris,
which is otherwise white or grey, has a brilliantly mottled streak along the upper border,
and also a slight orange stippling all round it.

The Chelonia show a great variety of colours. In many aquatic forms the iris is very
bright and mottled with various colours, while in the land tortoises it is usually brown.
Gapow* draws attention to the fact that Cistudo carolina (one of the Testudinide)
presents a remarkable case of sexual dimorphism, the male having a red iris, while the
female has a brown, one.

In many of the Geckos the iris is mottled in a peculiar way, showing a striped pattern
of dark brown on a light yellow-ochre or grey background, giving a weird appearance to
the eye, especially when the pupil is closed.

In Lacerta viridis (green lizard) the iris is of a brightly speckled gold colour. The
