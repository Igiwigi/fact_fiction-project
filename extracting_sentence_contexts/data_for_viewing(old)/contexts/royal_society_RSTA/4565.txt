persistence of doubt is what we may label the ‘fact
of uncertainty’. Uncertainty is intrinsic to science, and
this creates vulnerabilities that interested parties may,
and commonly do, exploit, both by attempting to
challenge the specific conclusions of technical experts
and by implying that those conclusions threaten other
social values.
