Tt would thus appear that after the occlusion of hydrogen has made a fair start, or
when the palladium has been largely converted into palladium hydrogen, a further
absorption is able to go on at the ordinary temperature. This may be due to the
change in texture of the palladium caused by ruptures between the particles of the

metal produced by the expansion during the first part of the charging. Granam (Joc.
cit., p. 267) remarks, “The foil was much crumpled and rather friable after repeated use.”

The fact that increase of temperature is necessary during the first part of the
absorption is to be ascribed not to an increase in the solubility of the hydrogen, but
to a more rapid diffusion, throughout the mass of the metal, of such hydrogen as can
be retained_at that particular temperature. The meaning of this will be rendered
clearer by reference to Devirue and Troost's well-known experiment on the passage
of hydrogen through a red-hot platinum tube, or to the similar passage of hydrogen
through a palladium tube above 237° C. (cf Ramsay, ‘Phil. Mag.,’ August, 1894,
p- 206).
