values, and his phase angles are most variable in the shorter period terms. It will be
seen in fact that the values obtained for c,/c,, &c., from the mean temperature
inequalities for 1892 to 1895, or 1889, 1890 and 1899, in § 62, are less than the
values we have just derived from General Srracuey’s figures.

§ 69. A rather striking illustration of the points of agreement and difference just
discussed, was afforded by the case of V at Kew. As already stated, all the tables
had to be re-ealeulated, making allowance for the non-application of a temperature
correction in earlier years of the period. I was puzzled for a time by the, at first
sight, remarkable fact that whilst the new values of ¢, differed very appreciably from
the old, there was exceedingly little difference between the new and old values of the
other ¢ coefficients, or of any of the phase angles. The explanation simply was that
the external diurnal temperature inequality was pretty exactly represented in the
magnetograph room—of course, on a very much reduced scale—with the hours of
maximum and minimum so retarded as to bring them much closer to the corresponding
times for the diurnal variation of V.

§ 70. There are other important coriclusions to be drawn from the comparison of
temperature and magnetics. The source of the solar diurnal inequality in magnetism
is, of course, the sun, acting in some way or other; the only question is how. The
researches of Gauss, Scumipr, Apams, and others all point to the conclusion that
magnetic force at the Earth’s surface is derived, if not exclusively, at least in a wholly
