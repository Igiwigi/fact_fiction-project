For every fermion degree of freedom, supersymmetry imposes that there must be
a corresponding bosonic one, with identical mass and couplings. Thus, for instance in figure 1,
supersymmetry imposes tp = iy and 2 =é [3]. In fact, fermions in the Standard Model (the quarks and leptons), each have two degrees of
freedom (left and right handed, meaning that their spins are in the same direction or in opposite
direction to the motion of the particle). When we supersymmetrize the model, we end up with
two scalar bosons for each Standard Model fundamental fermion. The supersymmetric scalar


boson copies are prepended with an ‘s’ to denote their different spin.
