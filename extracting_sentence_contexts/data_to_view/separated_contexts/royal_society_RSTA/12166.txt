Under this term I include various ~
detrital deposits to which different designations have been attached. Amongst the ~
more important of these are the drift called “head” over the Raised Beaches of the —
Channel and the Ossiferous Fissures of South Devon. :
Various explanations have been suggested to account for the “head,” such as, Ist, ~
an excessive rainfall, accompanied by great cold; 2nd, the sliding of masses of snow ~
and ice over slopes; 3rd, waves of translation ; 4th, torrential fluviatile action during r
a period of great cold. I have stated in the paper referred to the objections to these —
several explanations.{ Some of them, no doubt, would suffice to produce a portion of —
the observed effects, but they fail to embrace the whole, and they all involve conse-
quences which are incompatible with the general facts. They all, also, with one |
exception, depend on subaérial agencies, to which there is the general objection that
these agencies involve a certain amount of friction and weathering which are con-
spicuously wanting—or, if present, it is in a very slight degree—in the deposits —
under review. There is the further objection that some of the phenomena indicate —
the exercise of a propelling force for which the suggested causes are manifestly
inadequate. ‘There are other points, apparently inconsistent with such agencies, con-
nected more especially with the Ossiferous fissures and the Loess of the continental —
area, which will be considered more fully in the following pages. 1
In the present paper my object will be to show that the phenomena on which I
relied as proofs of submergence in England, extend likewise over large continental 2
Owing to the extent of the subject, it will be necessary to confine the inquiry to the —
more prominent and typical cases.
