To this extent, it is an experimental science....But its experimental foundations are so =)

irrefutably and so generally acknowledged, they have been confirmed to such a degree, that 1

no further proof of them is deemed necessary. Moreover, all that is needed is to derive these :3

foundations from a minimal set of independent axioms and thus to construct the whole edifice : =

geometry is turned into a pure mathematical science. In mechanics it is also the case that all D>

physicists recognize its most basic facts. But the arrangement of the basic concepts is still 1S

as a pure mathematical discipline, at least to the same extent that geometry is. ([6, p. 90]. : S

Thus, at the turn of the century, Hilbert consolidated his view of the axiomatic method as i8

a correct methodology to be applied, in parallel and with equal importance, to geometry and
