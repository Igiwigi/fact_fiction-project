Figure 2. Panel showing the results of applying the rewilding assessment framework to three projects, namely the Millingerwaard project (the Netherlands); the Swiss
National Park (Switzerland); and the Ibera project (Argentina). (a) Scores obtained for the variables at the beginning of the project and at present. A description of the
variables and indicators is available in table 1 and electronic supplementary material, table $1. (b) Representation of the estimated scores of direct human inputs and
outputs (H) and ecological integrity of ecosystems (F) in the bi-dimensional framework for each case study. d variables represent the naturalness of disturbances and
stochastic events, c variables represent landscape composition and connectivity and Â¢ variable represents the trophic complexity. The arrows indicate the trajectory of
change from the beginning of the projects to present. The rewilding score (A) is placed next to each point in time and has been calculated on the basis of the scores
shown in (a). Photographs courtesy of Rijkswaterstaat, SNP/H. Lozza and N. Fernandez. (Online version in colour.)
