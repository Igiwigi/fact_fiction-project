(a.) That the change in proportions does not occur in all the shells, nor to an equal
degree in those in which it is found. Thereby it differs from the changes which occur
in theâ€œtexture and colouring. . A few shells may be found in any terrace at Shumish
Kul which do not differ materially in shape from normal shells. In the case of Jaksi
Klich, however, almost all the shells are affected.

(b.) The second point noticeable in the occurrence of this variation is that it is far
more marked in shells of greater absolute size (that is, presumably, of greater
age) than in smaller and younger ones. This fuct is brought out in the second column
of the Tables.

(c.) The third fact which appears on comparing the averages is that the lengthening
of the shells occurred slightly in the shells of the second terrace ; increasingly in those
of the third and fourth ; reaching a point in the fifth terrace which is practically not
afterwards exceeded in shells found as much as 30 feet lower, though the changes in
texture, &c., had greatly progressed in these latter. Evidence will be given, moreover,
which tends to show that this lengthening of the shells is more probably due to some
other consequence of the diminished size of the lake than to the increase in saltness ;
for example, to its increasing shallowness and consequent high average temperature in
summer. Examples will be given of Cockles from lagoons both of the Aral Sea and
in Egypt, which, while differing entirely from those of these salt lakes in general
appearance, are yet like them in the proportion of length to breadth. The whole
question will be fully considered after the specimens have been described. The shells
on the several terraces may now be described in detail.
