the density matrix. We obtain the following equations of motion for its components Ry defined
by (2.15):

dR . .
ih ae — keNimRy, =f(R4 1), (4.8)
nett = kN, =f(Ry4), (4.9)

and similarly for Ry, and Rj). Regarding the off-diagonal terms we have the same equations
of motion as (2.18) if we replace —kg — 2g. Therefore, those terms decay due to a dephasing plus


decoherence effect [5]. On the other hand, the diagonal terms have a different time evolution from
(2.17), and in fact follow exactly the same evolution as Ry 4, hence they also disappear.

This consideration confirms that the interference terms of the density matrix cannot be
observed by the pointer, and they die out because of the effect of the spatially confined
apparatuses. Putting everything together, we can write the remaining terms of the final state as

Dr(t) = I. I. drdyots vinyl @ BG) +] | dxdyte.ninyl@ 00 4.10)

with Dtp) given in (2.19) and Bo) just given by 7(0) @ Ru(0). At ts, the spin is either in R or in R:
if the apparatus clicks, then the spin is there.
