the remainder of the tissne-mass instantly ceased. This experiment I performed
repeatedly, sometimes exposing a large and sometimes a small portion of the tissue to
the influence of the irritant. As I invariably obtained the same result, there can be
no doubt that in the cage of chemical, as in that of the after-effects of electrical
stimulation, the artificial rhythm depends for its manifestation on the presence of a
constant stimulus, and is not merely some kind of obscure fluttering motion which, having
been started by a stimulus, is afterwards kept up independently of any stimulus,

Such being the case, T naturally expected that if T were to supply a constant
stimulus of a thermal kind T should also obtain the phenomena of artificial rhythm,
In this, however, my expectations have not been realized. With no species of Medusa
have I been able to obtain the slightest indication of artificial rhythm by immersing
the paralyzed animals in heated water. I can only explain this fact by supposing that
the stimulus which is supplied by the heated medium is of tov uniform a character
oyer the whole extent of the excitable tissues ; ib would seem that in order to produce
artificial rhythm there must be a differential intensity of stimulation in different parts
of the responding tissue, for no doubt even the excitatory influence of acidulated
water is nob of nearly 80 uniform an intensity oyer the whole of the tissue area as is
that of heated water.

In now quitting the 8uhject of artificial rhythm as it is manifested by the paralyzed
bells of Sarsa, it is desirable again to observe that sustained artificial rhythm cannob
be produced either by means of chemical irritation or as the after-effect of electrical
stimulation in the case of any of the species of covered-eyed Meduse that I have met
with, In order to evoke any response at all, stronger solutions of the irritants require
