But these and other caves are
exceptional, and the circumstances under which they occur deserve particular investiga-

tion, as they may perhaps be due to some local peculiarity in the external form of the
ancient cone at such points. |=»

Dikes in the Val del Bove.

. Dr. CarLo GEMMELLARO, in 8everal of his memoirs on Mount Etna published in the
ears 1839, 1847, and 1854 *, &c., has argued against the © Elevation-crater” hypothesis,
by calling attention to the steepness of the slopes down which some of the modern

_lavas of Etna have flowed; and he has particularly insisted on a fact, first pointed out by

Shis brother Mario GEMMELLARO, that a great number of dikes radiate from the present

Scentre of Mongibello. Baron S. vox WALTERSHAUSEN, during his patient, explorations

Sof Etna, has also observed (see above, p. 741), that many dikes, thirteen or more in

ber, composed of greenstone, converge in like manner towards an ancient centre,

Scalled by us the axis of Trifoglietto. As8uming that all these dikes have been originally

Frertical, or nearly 80, they might retain their yerticality even after upheaval, if they

gradiated in exactly the same directions as the movements which uplifted the strata 80 as

Zto make them dip away quaquaversally from a central axis.
