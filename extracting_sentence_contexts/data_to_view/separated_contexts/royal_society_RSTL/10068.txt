ny
larval life it constitutes a considerable gland, the anterior end of which partly envelopes
the bile duct (Plate 27, fig. 68, p.). 4

Considering the undoubted affinities between Lepidosteus and the Teleostei, the
facts just recorded with reference to the pancreas appear to us to demonstrate that
the small s8ize and occasional absence (?) of this gland in Teleostei is a result of the
degeneration of this gland ; and it seems probable that the pancreas will be found
in the larye of mos Teleostei. These conclusions render intelligible, moreover, the
great development of the pancreas in the Elasmobranchii,

We have firsb noticed the pyloric caca arising as outgrowths of the duodenum in
larvez of about three weeks old, and they become rapidly louger and more prominent
(Plate 27, fig. 62, c.). 7

The portion of the intestine behind the vitelline duct is, as in all the Vertebrata, at
first straight.
