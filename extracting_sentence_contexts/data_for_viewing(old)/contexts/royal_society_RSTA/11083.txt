From this, if the data are accepted, it seems that the first waves of this phase may
travel at rates that rise to near 5 kiloms. per second, though those which are ordi-
narily registered at the commencement of this phase have not a greater apparent rate
of travel than about 3°5 kiloms. per second. +

If, instead of the very indeterminate commencement of this phase, we take the
more easily determinable time of the maximum movement, we find, as shown in the
table below, that greater uniformity of result which might be expected to follow
from the fact that the recorded times are less influenced by variations in the sensi-
tiveness of the different instruments.

* The miuimum values may be neglected, as they are evidently due to a tardiness in action of the
instruments.

+ The Sacramento earthquake of April 19, 1892, recorded at Strassburg, gives a rate of 3°8 kiloms. per
second over an are of 82°5°. The Venezuela shock of April 28, 1894, recorded in Russia, gives 3:5 and
4:0 kiloms. per second over ares of 93°8° and 93:6" respectively. ‘The earlier phases of these shocks were
not recorded,
