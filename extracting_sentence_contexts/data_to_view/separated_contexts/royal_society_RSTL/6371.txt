1022 MR. PENGELLY ON THE LIGNITES AND

- As we descended, the thickness of each bed and the amount and direction of its dip-
were carefully measured; a sample, and when necessary more than one, of every bed
was taken, each in a separate box, and every important fact, as to the character of the
bed and the occurrence or not of fossils in it, was carefully noted. The mean of the
several measurements, all yery near the average, gave a dip of 12Z* towards S. 35* W.
