respiration, an estimate may be made of the pattern at term subjected to distension. The
result, N=179, is in tolerably good agreement with the figure for 24 hr. (N=164). However,
many lobules remain collapsed, and the whole picture is so varied that quantitative esti-
mates can only be made in those parts where reasonably uniform conditions are present.
Results for the post-natal period are shown in table 26.

By 48 hr., in spite of the fact that lung volume has increased, the number of intersections
is of the same order as the figure at term. By 5 days it is exceeded and more so by the 10th
day. When it is remembered that lung volume was increased by a factor of almost 2 at 48 hr.,
by 3-2 at 5 days and by 5 at the 10th day, it is obvious that considerable new formation of
septa is taking place. It would otherwise be impossible for the counted number of inter-
sections to increase, for unless the pattern changes, distension of the septal mesh by respira-
tion must of necessity reduce the numbers of intersections, in proportion to the cube root of
the increase of lung volume.

At some time between the 10th day and 3rd month of the rabbit’s life, the formation of
septa ceases. The counts of septa therefore fall slowly as the result of distension by growth of
the existing lung architecture. By dividing the counts from term onwards by the cube roo
of increase in volume at the same times an estimate may be made of the resulting complexity
