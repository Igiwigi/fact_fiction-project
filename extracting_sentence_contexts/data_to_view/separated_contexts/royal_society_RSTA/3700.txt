While Hofmann erroneously suggested a model for the structure : =
of methane where the hydrogens define the corners of a square whose centre is the carbon, : >
Kekul√© proposed a hexagonal geometry for benzene, with all atoms in the same plane. This was [a
corroborated by the X-ray crystallography experiments of Lonsdale in 1929 [4]. In fact, the advent 8
of quantum chemistry and X-ray crystallography techniques enabled the discovery of the fantastic :s
world of complexity and diversity of structures arising in Nature or that can be prepared in the [8

laboratory. Nowadays, the concept of structure is in the realm of modern chemistry, because it is
intimately related to the fundamental properties of matter; hence, much work has been devoted
to the development of techniques to discover low-energy structures. In the last two decades or so, there has been great interest in the exploration of low-energy
landscapes with the aim of discovering stable structures of a great diversity of systems [5],
including atomic and molecular clusters, proteins and colloids.
