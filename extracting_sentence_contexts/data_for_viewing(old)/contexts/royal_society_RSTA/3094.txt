involve ‘claims that particular emissions are the proximate cause of particular adverse climate
change impacts’, but the trend is growing. No claim asserting liability for particular emissions


linked to a particular impact has yet succeeded; and many (perhaps all) that remain on the docket
seem likely to fail for lack of jurisdiction or a causal link (for an analysis of the challenges plaintiffs
face in such cases, see [47]). But no defendant can afford to ignore the risk of liability. As plaintiffs
experiment with other theories of liability and as the effects of global warming become more dire,
it seems only a matter of time before such a case succeeds, encouraging many other plaintiffs to
follow suit.

I favour these litigation developments, but not because I see litigation as either a very efficient
or fair way of addressing impacts from climate change. (In fact, it is neither.) Rather, the risk
of liability—borne either by governments or private companies—could become a source of
substantial leverage for those advocating for deeper emissions cuts and more generous loss-and-
damage policies. Opportunities to trade legal claims for expanded aid are therefore included
in the PRF and the displacement facility described above. But nations should be careful about :
trading away too much, too soon. Because future warming scenarios remain uncertain, it might [=
be helpful to link the level of liability waived to the occurrence of certain physical impacts. Thus, :s
small island states might agree to limit claims of liability to a certain sum as long as sea-level rise :
remains below a certain rate or as long as the amount of global warming remains at or below Dk
1.5°C. To maximize the leverage that litigation provides, it is important that climate attribution :
remain a focus of the scientific community. 4
