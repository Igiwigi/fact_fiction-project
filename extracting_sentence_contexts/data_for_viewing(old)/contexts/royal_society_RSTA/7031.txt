Ficure 7. Temperature-broadening of emission edges.

In figure 7 we have reduced to intensities /(Z) the photometer curves of the Z,-edges
of Na, Mg and Al, corresponding to different temperatures. The contribution of the
L,-edges has been eliminated. The instrumental line widths are indicated, and theo-
retical points from equations (6) and (7) are plotted. It must be remembered that
these assume that N,(#) is constant; in actual fact, it is increasing with increasing E
up to the edge, so some slight misfit on the low-energy side is inevitable. The un-
corrected points are badly off the curves corresponding to 110Â° K, especially for Al.
But in this case, when the correction for slit width is applied, the discrepancy is nearly
accounted for. For Mg, the agreement is not quite so good, while, for Na, the correction
is negligible. Perhaps temperature errors, due to the inefficiency of liquid oxygen as

a cooling fluid, are involved.* For higher temperatures, the uncorrected points are
only slightly off the curves, and, without making an exact calculation of the effect
of the slit width, it is clear that correction would bring the agreement within the
