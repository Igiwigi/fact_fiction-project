The intestine is connected with the parietes of the sinus in which it lies by in-
numerable delicate short threads, like a fine areolar tissue.

14. In Salpa A, the only other organ contained in the circum-visceral sinus, be-
sides the intestine and © system of tubes,” is a mass of clear cells (&), rendered poly-
gonal by mutual pressure, and placed at the upper and back part of the sinus; to
this body the name of © elzeoblast” has been given by Kronn. Tt has by some authors
been confounded with a liver, an organ to which it certainly has no analogy what-
ever. The elzoblast is much larger and more conspicuous in the young than in the

adult Salpe, and frequently, but not always, its cells contain an oily matter.
S There would seem to be no clue either to the homology or to the function of this
%lzeoblast. Without hazarding a conjecture, it may be remarked, as a curious fact,
=that these animals, 80 remarkable for possessing in the foetal state a trae though
radimentary placental circulation, possess an organ which in structure and duration
Somewhat calls to mind the thymus gland.
= 15. The nervous system consists of a single subspherical ganglion (4), situated in
Abe space between the inner and outer tunics, just where the anterior and lower ex-
Aremity of the hypopharyngeal band joins the ventral paries. It gives off two delicate
Sbranches forward to the © languet” (16.), and a great many in all directions to the
Sparietes of the body. There were no branches traceable specially to the mouth or
*Ztowards the cesophagus.
= A delicate but strong vesicle attached to the anterior and lower surface of the
Zzanglion, and containing four subbemispherical calcareous bodies, with black pigment
Z5pots on their outer surface, evidently represents the auditory vesicle and its otolithes
