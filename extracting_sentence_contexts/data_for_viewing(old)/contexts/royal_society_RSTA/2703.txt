We see that the nowcast hazard is about a factor of two lower using the observed scaling versus
the GR scaling.

5. Discussion

If the seismicity in a region is statistically stationary (not a function of time) the mean intervals
between events with magnitudes greater than a specified value can be obtained directly from
the form of GR scaling given in equation (1.2). If b=1, the mean interevent time increases by a
factor of 10 for each unit change of magnitude. If there are 10 M > 3 earthquakes per year in the


region, on average there will be one M > 4 earthquake per year, a mean interval of 10 years for a
M2 5 earthquake, etc. This approach is, in fact, useful to provide a measure of the seismic hazard.
However, seismic activity is in general time-dependent; aftershocks are a prime example. In this
paper, we illustrate how the concept of seismic nowcasting can be used to provide estimates
of the statistical hazard at the present time. The method can be applied when the seismicity is
time-dependent, for example during an aftershock sequence.

Nowcasting uses the concept of natural time, which is an event count. For seismic nowcasting
the event count is the number of earthquakes above a minimum earthquake magnitude M > Mg,
Neco. The objective is to relate the natural time count to the number of large earthquakes with
magnitude M > M,, Nc. This association requires the validity of a frequency-magnitude scaling
throughout the range of magnitudes considered. If the scaling is GR then the relationship is given
by equation (1.2), but GR scaling is not required for nowcasting seismicity. Data on frequency-
magnitude scaling provide the network sensitivity and the smallest magnitude for which the
