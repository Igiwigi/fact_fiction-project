When gently heated it evolves water and ammonia, and leaves the yellow substance
Pd CI + N Hz. The same decomposition may be effected by evaporating its soJu-
tion to dryness, in which case the yellow salt generally crystallizes in cubes. Were
it not hazardous to draw any inference with regard to the isomorphism of bodies be-
longing to the regular system, I should notice this fact as illustrative of the equiva-
lency of Pd CI. N H, with K. By a very cautious application of heat to the colour-
less erystallized salt, s0me water may be expelled before the ammonia begins to come
off, but T have never succeeded in rendering it quite anhydrous.
