being made on single specimens, from 4*4 per cent. of the vertebral column in
Stage A to 104°6 per cent. in Stage K. In the adult it varies from 88 per cent.
(A. australis, 2) to 98 per cent. (A. australis, g), thus undergoing a relative
diminution in size between the time of hatching and the attainment of fully adult
proportions. It is quite possible that this rather remarkable result is to be put down
to individual variation, but I hardly think so, as the three specimens belonging to
Stage K and the single specimen of Stage L (not shown in the diagram) all have the
hind-limb more than 100 per cent. of the vertebral column, while in the adult it was
below 95 per cent. in six out of seven skeletons measured.

The four divisions of the limb—femur, crus, tarso-metatarsus, and middle (third)
digit—increase in much the same manner as the whole limb, the only point worthy of
special mention being the fact that the middle digit is at first (Stages D and E) not
more than half the length of the tarso-metatarsus, while from Stage E onwards it
gradually incveases until the two divisions of the foot are of equal length in H. This
proportion is retained as far as L, but in the adult the middle digit is, in seven
skeletons measured, slightly shorter than the tarso-metatarsus. So that in the
relative proportions of the two divisions of the foot, as in that of the entire hind-
limb, the maximum differentiation appears to be attained about the time of hatching,
a retrogression towards more embryonic proportions taking place subsequently.

As to sexual and specific differences I find that the legs of the male are relatively
longer than those cf the female. In the skeletons examined the legs of the male are
