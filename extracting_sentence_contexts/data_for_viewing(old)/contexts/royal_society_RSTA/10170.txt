18 DR. W. A. BONE AND MR. R. V. WHEELER ON THE COMBINATION OF

Tn a comparative experiment (VI.) made, three days later, with normal electrolytic
gas, under precisely the same conditions, [only 21°5 per cent. of the oxygen initially
present disappeared during the first two hours, the values of “ k,” varying between
0:0572 and 0:0532 as the pressure in the apparatus fell from 429°6 to 116-6 millims.
in 12 hours.—February 10, 1906.]

These two experiments bring to light the significant fact that where an excess of
hydrogen is initially present, the rate of combination does not depend on the partial
pressure of the oxygen, as the diffusion theory demands, but rather on that of the
hydrogen. The increasing excess of hydrogen in Experiment V. steadily accelerated
the disappearance of the oxygen.

In the next three experiments (VII. to IX. inclusive), the influence of rather a
large excess of hydrogen or oxygen respectively on the initial rate of change was
studied. The rate of circulation was the same in all three experiments, but it was
purposely made slower than in the two preceding experiments, in order that the
reaction might be extended over 8 or 10 hours in each case. In Experiment VII.
(April 7, 1904), the mean value of the reaction constant “i,” for normal electrolytic
gas was found to be 0:0195.
