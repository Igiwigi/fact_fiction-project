Of these: 1, female, is an adult; 2, female or male, is that of a young person 16 to
18 years old, and, according to Kontimann, probably, but not certainly, female ;
3, female, and 4, female or male, are adults, but as we see the sex of the latter
appears doubtful. Proceeding, as in the earlier cases, we find :—

struct stature, arises from the fact that the regression coefficients for long bones and stature are known
for one local race only, and that we have nothing else to go upon. Had we endeavoured to reconstruct
one long bone from a second, we should have had far more exact material to determine the differential

evolution of local races.
