We see, indeed,
from the record that the sudden changes 4, 5, 6 are generally more intense than the
rest. It is mterestmg to note the sequence of the sudden changes produced in this
record. The fact that a number of sudden changes more or less similar in character
and of the same sign occur in succession does apparently suggest a kind of persistency
in the manner in which lightning discharges occur. If a lightning discharge occurs
between one part of the cloud and another, the next few lightning discharges will occur
between the same two parts of the cloud, in a more or less similar manner. I will now proceed to discuss the quick-run record obtained during the passage of the
thunderstorm of October 28, 1930.
