What are the key features of this
organization, and how do they relate? Both interactional soci-
ology and enaction view the autonomy of social interaction
as arising from the coordination of behaviours. A basic differ-
ence between the two fields is that interactional sociology
approaches the coordination of behaviours in a more structural
way—speaking of structures and practices as normative prin-
ciples that are there, as social facts, prior to any situated
social interaction, while enaction views coordination more in
terms of emergent processes. This different orientation stems
from differences in background and methodology. It is not a
very strict division, and each field also has affinities with the
other’s perspective.
