Conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the impact of non-ergodicity on the individual income dynamics,
with the aim to evaluate the role of randomness in the observed rise in income inequality and
the decline in mobility all over the world. Similar to previous works dealing with inequality and
mobility, we used the properties of srGBM, an established model for non-ergodic income growth. The fact that in srGBM, the extent of non-ergodicity is manifested via different regimes, allowed
us to perform a theoretical analysis for the behaviour of income inequality and mobility measures. This, in turn, aided us in devising an empirical test for investigating the presence of different
regimes in real-world income dynamics. We showed that different regimes also appear in the behaviour of inequality measures, but
not in the dynamics of mobility measures.
