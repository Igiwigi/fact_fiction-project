lators, gave very little of this return charge.

1243. I tried the same experiment having air only in the inductive apparatus.
After a continued high charge for some time I could obtain a little effect of return
action, but it was ultimately traced to the shell-lac of the stem.

1244. I songht to produce something like this state with one electric power and
without induction; for upon the theory of an electric fluid or fluids, that did not seem
impossible, and then I should haye obtained an absolute charge (1169. 1177.), or
something equiyalent to it. In this I could not succeed. I excited the outside of a
cylinder of sbell-lac very highly for some time, and then quickly discharging it
(1203.), waited and watched whether any return charge would appear, but such
was not the case. This is another fact in fayour of the inseparability of the two elec-
tric forces, and another argument for the view that induction and its concomitant
phenomena depend upon a polarity of the particles of matter.

1245. Although inclined at first to refer these effects to a peculiar masked con-
dition of a certain portion of the forces, I think I have since correctly traced them to
known principles of electrical action. The effects appear to be due to an actual pe-
netration of the charge to some distance within the electric, at each of its two sur-
faces, by what we call conduction ; 80 that, to use the ordinary phrase, the electric
forces sustaining the induction are not upon the metallic surfaces only, but upon and
within the dielectric also, extending to a greater or smaller depth from the metal
linings. Let c (fig. 10.) be the section of a plate of any dielectric, a and 6 being the
metallic coatings ; let b be uninsulated, and @ be charged positively ; after ten or fif-
