The
difference is due to the shedding of about 40 per cent. of the flowers after they
have opened. This difference is practically constant throughout all varieties of
cotton in any part of Egypt, though some suffer more in the south, where it is
hotter. The fact that all spacings are equally affected has a direct bearing on our
former conclusion, that the automatic self-regulation of the plant is sufficient to
compensate for the different environmental conditions. It also indicates that the
cause of this comparative constancy in shedding is one which acts at regular intervals
over a short period, and there can be little doubt that the condition of water-strain
which occurs every afternoon is this cause. Although the average amount of shedding in good cultivation is practically constant,
there are fluctuations from the average with which we shall deal later.
