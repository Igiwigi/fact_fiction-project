So easily are
effects attainable that (as will be seen later on) they afford to us the readiesb way! obtaining luminous discharges suitable for an important part of our investigatio And if we recollect how intimately the existence of unipolar and double unipolar d
charges in ordinary vacuum tubes is connected with the fact that the discharge Â©
each terminal is independent of the action elsewhere than in its own neighbourho
we shall see that the existence of similar phenomena in high-yacuum tubes is strol
evidence of the substantial identity of the modus operand! of the discharge in the by

Cages. The various types of evidence which we have already given represent, after all, 0


ON THE SENSITIVE STATE OF VACUUM DISCHARGES.
