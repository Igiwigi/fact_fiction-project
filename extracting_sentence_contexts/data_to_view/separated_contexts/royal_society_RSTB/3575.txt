= figure. The conchoidal fractures are shown in the drawing. Nore to Fies. 25 and 26,—The interest of this specimen is greatly enhanced hy the fact that I have
received from Mr. EpwArp HeroNn-ALLEN a hammer-stone of the same shape and workmanship, but
twice as big by linear measurement, found by him on the coast at Selsea Bill in a gravel of undetermined
age. From the same source I have also received an enormous rostro-carinate flint implement,
weighing 5 Ibs. 9 ozs., discovered in the same deposit.
