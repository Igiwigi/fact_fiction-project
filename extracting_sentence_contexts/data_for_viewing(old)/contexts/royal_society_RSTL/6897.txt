'This last is the volume of the central pedal surface of an ellipse (art. 13), By substitu-
tion in art. 28, it will be found that the volume of any other pedal of this curve is given
by the formula

to which expression we should have been led at once had we sought, directly, the
values of A,,, Az, Azz as exhibited in art. 13, In fact when @,=a,, the above formula
may be easily reduced to the one already found in art. 13 for the yolume of the pedal
surface of a circle.

the special cases of ellipsoids of rotation.
