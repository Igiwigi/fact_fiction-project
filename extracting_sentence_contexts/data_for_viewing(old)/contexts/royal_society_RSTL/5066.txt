& Containing a Magnetic Survey of a considerable portion of the North American Continent.

Z FROM the moment that the fact was known, that the locality of the maximum of the
= magnetic Force in a hemisphere is not coincident, as was previously supposed, with
S the locality where the dip of the needle is 90*, researches in terrestrial magnetism
2 assumed an interest and importance greatly exceeding that which they before pos-
& $essed ; for it was obvious that the hypothesis which then generally prevailed regard-
2 ing the distribution of the magnetic Force at the surface of the globe, and which had
v5 Heen based on a too-limited induction, was erroneous, and that even the broad out-
S line of the general view of terrestrial magnetism had to be recast.

i= The observations on which this discovery rested, (being those which I had had an
# opportunity of making in 1818, 1819 and 1820 within the Arctic Circle, and at New
SZ York in 1822,) were published in 1825*; they constituted, I may be permitted to say,
2 an important feature in the views, which led the British Association in the year 1835
