VII. On the general Principles of the chemical Changes produced
by Electricity

The experiments of Mr. Benner had shown, that many

bodies brought into contact and afterwards separated, exhibited
opposite states of electricity ; but it is to the investigations of
VorTa that a clear developement of the fact is owing; he
has distinctly shown it in the case of copper and zinc, and
other metallic combinations ; and has supposed that it also
takes place with regard to metals and fluids.

In a series of experiments made in 1801,* on the construc-
tion of electrical combinations by means of alternations of
single metallic plates, and different strata of fluids, I observed
that when acid and alkaline solutions were employed as ele-
ments of these instruments, the alkaline solutions always
received the electricity from the metal, and the acid always
transmitted it to the metal ; thus, in an arrangement of which
the elements were tin, water, and solution of potash, the
