With a north pole below,
ï¬†x downward currents were first transmitted ; the first of them gave a torsion of
5'5 mm. to the right hand, and the sncceeding ones had no effect. After restoring the
polarity as before, six upward currents were passed : the first produced a movement of
6*25 mm. to the left hand, and the others had no visible effect.

'The sudden cessation of torsion after the firs: current in steel, and the much more
gradual cessation of it in iron, are quite conspicuous. The fact that the magnitudes of
the first torsions, both in iron and steel, are smaller with a north pole below than with
a south one, agrees with the view that the magnitude of the movements depends upon
that of the residuary longitudinal magnetism. To ascertain whether in s8uch experiments as these some of the longitudinal mag-
netisgm remained after the firs: axial current had passed, although no torsion was
produced by the subsequent axial currents, I transmitted through the coil (containing
a steel wire) a current producing a south pole below, then passed 10 axial currents in
succession down the wire ; only the firs: one produced torsion. On then transmitting
a current, wp the wire, a torsion occurred, proving that the magnetic effect of the coil
current still remained.
