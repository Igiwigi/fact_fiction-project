by the experimental manipulation at all, and, in line with previous literature, people with
higher and lower levels of scepticism responded to the argument in different ways [38]. This
suggests that the overall impact of moral hazard arguments in public and policy discourse
may be simply to reinforce existing beliefs. For those strongly opposed to geoengineering,
the moral hazard argument presents another piece of evidence confirming their views; for
those sceptical about climate change, the moral ‘hazard’ of reducing mitigation is in fact not a
hazard at all.

In addition, it is clear that the counter moral hazard argument could have been constructed
differently. In this study, the argument states that, although geoengineering may distract from
current policies, this is not in fact a moral hazard. An alternative—and arguably just as plausible—
counter-argument would be that, although reducing current commitments on mitigation would
be a negative outcome, geoengineering will not in fact cause this to happen. In other words,
geoengineering will coexist with existing policies, in the same way that adaptation now coexists
with mitigation.


However, while there are undoubtedly multiple ways of conceiving of the moral hazard
argument, the contribution of this study is in beginning to quantify what public responses to
these may be. As geoengineering continues to rise up the science and policy agenda, the current
results provide an indication of how compelling the moral hazard argument is likely to be, but
also what sorts of people may be persuaded by it.

Here, as with so many other areas of the debate about climate change policies, personal values
and levels of scepticism are likely to play a crucial role. This study provides the first quantitative
