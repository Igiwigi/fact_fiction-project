force, (i. e. the electricity,) diminishes the proportion of such force, and increases the
proportion of that which is local (996. 1120.). Now the liquid in the cells possesses
this retarding power, and therefore acts injuriously, in greater or less proportion, ac-
cording to the quantity of it hetween the zine and copper plates, i. e. according to the
distances between their surfaces. A trough, therefore, in which the plates are only
half the distance asunder at which they are placed in another, will produce more
transferable, and less local, force than the latter ; and thus, because the electrolyte
in the cells can transmit the current more readily, both the intensity and quantity of
electricity is increased for a given consumption of zinc. To this circumstance mainly
I attribute the superiority of the trough I have described (1134.).

1149. The superiority of double coppers over single plates also depends in part upon
diminishing the resistance offered by the electrolyte between the metals. For, in fact,
with double coppers the sectional area of the interposed acid becomes nearly double
that with single coppers, and therefore it more freely transfers the electricity. Double
coppers are, however, effective, mainly because they virtually double the acting sur-
face of the zinc, or nearly $0; for in a trough with single copper plates and the usual
construction of cells, that surface of zinc which is not opposed to a copper surface is
thrown almost entirely out of yoltaic action, yet the acid continues to act upon it and
the metal is dissolved, producing very little more than local effect (947. 996.). But
when by doubling the copper, that metal is opposed to the second surface of the zinc
plate, then a great part of the action upon the latter is converted into transferable
force, and thus the power of the trough as to quantity of electricity is highly exalted.
