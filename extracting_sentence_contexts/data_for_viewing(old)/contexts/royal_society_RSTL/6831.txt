Neither ganglion-cell, nor nerve-fibre, nor indeed any {iving tisue exists without there
being tiving germinal matter in connexion with it. On the other hand, masses of ger-
minal matter exist before either ganglion-cells or distinct fibres are formed. If figs. 5,
9, 14, 15, 16, & 38, which represent young ganglion-cells, be contrasted with figs. 1, 3,
4, 20, & 27, which are taken from fully formed or old cells, the different proportion of
* germinal matter” to the © formed material” at different ages will be observed ; and it is
to be noticed that the youngest cells (fig. 9) consist almost entirely of germinal matter,
while in the fully formed cell there is at least from ten to twenty times as much * formed
material” as there is of © germinal matter” (tig. 1).

In the fully formed cell the germinal matter (nucleus) exhibits a line around it, but
there is no cell-wall or other structure between it and the granular material which
surrounds it. In fact, by the use of high powers, an actual continuity of structure
may usually be demonstrated, The smaller centres (nucleoli) also seem to be distinet
from the germinal matter in which they lie. Even in these s0-called * nucleoli ” still
smaller spherical bodies, to the number of three or four (nucleoluli), are sometimes to
be seen distinctly (figs. 26 & 27). These centres are evidently formed one within the
other.

The last or smallest centres are most darkly coloured. In the *nucleoli” the colour is
not 80 intense. The © nuclei” again are till paler, but nevertheless the colour is very
decided indeed. The matter more external is yery faintly coloured, or it remains per-
fectly colourless. So that in this, as in many other instances elsewhere, it is to be
noticed that the outer part of each cell, or that in actual contact with the colouring
80lution, is not coloured, while the intensity of the colour gradually increases as We -
