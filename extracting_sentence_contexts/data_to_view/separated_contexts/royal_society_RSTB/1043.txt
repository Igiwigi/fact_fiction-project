This expectation was, however, only
3 partially realised ; I found, on the contrary, a great uniformity in the development of
© the different forms, an agreement, in fact, so close that all might be conveniently
treated together. The species studied were Balanus perforatus, Chthamalus stellatus,
Port; Lepas anatifera, Lyn. ; L. pectinata, Spencuer; and Conchoderma virgata,
Srencier. I was enabled by a comparison of these forms to confirm previous work
on certain points, and to establish other facts which have, in many cases, the merit
of reconciling apparently discordant opinions. ‘The present account treats of the
development of these forms as far as and including the second Nauplius stage. The early development of the Rhizocephalan genus Peltogaster was also investi-
gated, but as this form showed certain differences from the others, I judged it best to
reserve my account of it for a future occasion. MDCCCXCIV.—-B.
