It is
worth noticing that the angle is independent of the dimension and in fact the same result holds
in the infinite dimensional case as well. The asymptotic behaviour of T(t) in ub follows from the previous considerations and the
spectral results of §4b. It is clear, in fact, that T(t)f > Pf pointwise for f € C,(RN), where Pf
is the projection defined by the right-hand side of (3.12). By Lebesgue theorem, we obtain
limy +00 I T(DF — PFilne =0 for every f € C,(RN) and then by density for all functions f € Ly. On
the other hand, 0 is an eigenvalue of A, for p > 1, the other eigenvalues have negative real parts
and the semigroup is analytic (and also compact), see §4b.
