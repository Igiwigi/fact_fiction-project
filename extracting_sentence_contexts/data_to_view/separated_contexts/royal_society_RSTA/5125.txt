Thus, the contributions to the tensions : S
of the tendons from the heave and pitch motions are comparable. This means that the peak in : =
heave does not automatically lead to a peak in the tensions. In fact, due to the combined effect D8
of heave and pitch, the second local peak of the tension occurs at w,/R/g * 1.078 for tendon : oe
one and w,/R/g ~ 1.085 for tendon two, slightly away from the heave resonant frequency at : RS
o,/R/g ~ 1.081. We may also note from figure 16b that there is a local trough at ,/R/g ~ 1.074 : S
for tendon two. This is because the amplitudes of ke / pgAR? and kag) / pgAR? are comparable : 5

but their phases are almost opposite one another for tendon two, which leads to the partial
cancellation in the tension.
