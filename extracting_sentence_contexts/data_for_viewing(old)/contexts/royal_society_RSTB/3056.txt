+ The period of gestation in the Wolf is 63 days (Dublin Zoo) ; that of the Fox is said to be two months,
or about the same time (MILLAIS, 1904).

} Ina more recent letter Mr. Cocks informs us that the old female in his possession came in season and
took the male last autumn (1904), after the death of the kittens which were born earlier in the same year.

Mr. Cocks refers to the fact that a female in captivity was seen to copulate on one occasion on
February 17 and also on February 21, so that the estrous period in the wild Cat must last for at least
five days.* In the domestic Cat we have observed the period to be about the same time.

The larger species of ‘the Felide in their wild state probably agree in having a
single annual breeding season. In captivity some members of the group at any rate
come “on heat” more frequently. The Lionesses in the Dublin Zoological Gardens, a
place famous for the success in Lion breeding achieved there, experience two cestrous
periods annually, even if allowed to become pregnant. If the copulation is
unsuccessful, or if not permitted to breed, they are said to come “on heat” three or
four times within a year, a frequency at least as great as that shown by the domestic
Cat. Mr. Rospert LeapBerter, who has bred several litters of Lion cubs at Hazlemere
Park, Buckinghamshire, informs us that Lionesses do not as a rule begin to come
