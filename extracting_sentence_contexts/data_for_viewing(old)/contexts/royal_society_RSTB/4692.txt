guinea-pig, in addition to their highly specific sensitiveness for a particular protein,
have a more general instability to toxic influences producing a similar type of action ;
and it might be thought that the differences between the symptoms produced by
anaphylatoxins in the normal animal and those produced by the specific antigen in
the anaphylactic animal could be thus explained. We shall see, however, that there is
no evidence of such greater sensitiveness of the tissues of the anaphylactic animal to
the anaphylatoxins themselves. Nor would such a supposition explain the appear-
ance of the difference only with certain batches of anaphylatoxin, or the surprising

fact that an injection of agar-sol will sometimes kill the anaphylactic guinea-pig as
rapidly as does the ready-formed anaphylatoxin.

Post-mortem Appearances,

The permanent distension of the lungs, first described by AvER and Lewis (6),
has long been regarded as the most characteristic result of death from anaphylactic
shock in the guinea-pig. It is so, in the sense that it is the expression of the
bronchial spasm which is the cause of anaphylactic death in that species, The
failure of the lungs to collapse, when the chest is opened after death, cannot by
itself, however, be regarded as indicating any connection between the cause of death
and anaphylaxis. The guinea-pig is peculiarly liable to death from obstruction of
the bronchial tubes, and obstruction by blood, secretion or cedema-fluid, produces a
