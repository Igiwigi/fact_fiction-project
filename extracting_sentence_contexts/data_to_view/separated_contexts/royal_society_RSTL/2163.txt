The elastic transparent jelly uniting the globules together,
had not the same elasticity as in the nervous fibre, so that
it could not be drawn out from the contracted state to double
its length without breaking. The muscular fibre of a trout was treated in the same
way, and the result was the same ; the fibres were however
more brittle than those in the bullock's neck. From these facts, in addition to those communicated in
the examination of the structure of ganglions, it is at last
ascertained, that the structure of the fibres of nerves in
general, and those peculiar to ganglions, as well as those that
compose muscles, is 80 far the same, that they consist of
single rows of globules united together by an elastic gelati-
nous transparent matter ; they differ however in the size of
the globules, and the degree of elasticity of the medium by
which they are united ; 0 that a less power will elongate a
nerve than the fibres of a muscle, and to a greater extent,
and it will restore itself with more velocity to a state of rest. This structure of nerves and muscles, I consider to be


from which its elongation and contraction. is derived.
