As the sea retired,
this sheet of water would also have been drained off, had it not been dammed up at
the only outlet (at Alkistan) to preserve the beauty of the promenade, one of the
finest in the neighbourhood of the city. At present it is dammed up to the height of
four or five feet, and the character of all the land around shows that in ancient times
it has been very much higher and more extensive.” Now a reader would infer from this description, that but for an artificial dam this
lake would have been laid dry; but the fact is that it fills a deep hollow in the granitic
rocks of this district ; and the only effect of the small dam is that the mean height
of the water is s0mewhat more uniform throughout the year. The outlet alluded to
is at Alkistan (see Map, fig. 7.), where a slight wooden dam has been erected, 80
small, that every year in the spring the water flows over it; s0 that the annual ex-
treme height of the water is still the same as it would be if the dam were removed.
