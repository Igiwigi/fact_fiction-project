E Tf the supposition is true that the ventricle in the Dog, and presumably in Man
R180, is distended during each diastole to about its maximum capacity, it would
Sem that variations in pulse-rate should have but little influence upon the quantity
"Df blood ejected at each 8ystole. From our experiments on the influence of pulse-
Bate on the outflow from the Dog's heart (see Section IV.), even when a pressure
Fras used that gave at the ordinary temperature at which the blood was kept the
oaximum outflow, or very nearly the maximum outflow at each beat, it was found
Ahat slowing the pulse-rate increases very considerably the outflow at each beat. Ab is true that this may have been owing to the fact that the method used for slowing
Hhe pulse-rate, viz., by running cold blood through the heart, may have caused more
Sr less change in the elastic properties of the ventricular walls. The whole question
=R one that rests as yet, as far as our experiments are concerned at least, upon
Puppositions that lack experimental confirmation. We hope ultimately, after carrying
Sut similar experiments upon other animals, to be in a better condition to speak on
