If
d(E) ~ e= with a > 0 at large energies E, then there is a limiting temperature since when f <a
the partition function diverges. This kind of growth in the density of states with energy does not
occur in typical quantum systems, but it does appear in string theory and in the physics of black
holes, and, as I will explain, is connected to the work of Hardy-Ramanujan on the growth of the
number of partitions of integers p(n). The fundamental reason why Ramanujanâ€™s work has had a significant impact on physics is
due to the fact that modular forms play a central role in string theory and two-dimensional CFT. The basic reason for this is the following. A closed string at a fixed time is an S! embedded
into some ambient space.
