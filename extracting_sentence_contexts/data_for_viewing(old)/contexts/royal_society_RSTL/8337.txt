> An interesting physical speculation connected with this working hypothesis is the
Z effect on the period of duration of a star's heat which would be brought about by
Sz asming that the original atoms of which a star is composed are possessed with the
J increased potential energy of combination which this hypothesis endows them with.

May it not also be that if chemists take up this question which has arisen from the
E gpectroscopic evidence of what I haye before termed the plasticity of the molecules of
Â© - the metalloids taken as a whole, much of the power of variation which is at present
EZ accorded to metals may be traced home to the metalloids? I need only refer to the
EZ fact that, 80 far as T can learn, all 80-called changes of atomicity take place when metal-
S loids are involyed, and not when metals alone are in question.

| As instances of these, T may refer to the triatomic combinations formed with chlorine,
2 oxygen, suIphur, &e. in the case of tetrad or hexad metals.

5 May we not from these ideas be justified in defining a metal, provisionally, as a
A substance, the absorption-spectrum of which is generally the same as the radiation-

spectrum, while the metalloids are substances the absorption-spectrum of which, gene-
rally, is not the same? In other words, in passing from a cold to a comparatively hot
8ate, the plasticity of these latter comes into play, and we get a new molecular arrange-
ment, Hence are we not justified in asking whether the change from oxygen to ozone
