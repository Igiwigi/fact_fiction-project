By repeated observations I found that if

Scare were taken to measure out exactly the same volume of the dilute acid and ammonia,

She change from one spectrum to the other might be almost indefinitely repeated. = Without wishing at this stage to enter into a discussion concerning the cause of the
Zchanges which nitrites induce, I shall confine myself to remarking that the observations
which I have described appeared to me to showâ€”
First, that nitrites exert a marked influence both on the colour and the spectrum of
blood, due obviously to a chemical change exerted on the colouring-matter. that, whatever the nature of the change, it is obviously not one which mates

Secondly,
by mere action of reducing-agents _

rially alters the composition of the colouring-matter, as
all effects of the change disappear ; and

Thirdly, that the fact of reducing-agents developing,
atmospheric oxygen. the spectrum of oxidized hzmoglob
action, proves that by the action of nitrites the loose oxy
