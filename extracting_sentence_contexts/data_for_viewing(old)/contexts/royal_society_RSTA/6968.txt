Similar expressions for w, can be obtained from this table by changing thesign of h, replacing
5 w, by we, w, by w;, etc.; in the error term backward differences replace forward differences
a and the factor (— 1)" becomes — 1.

8» For a boundary condition of the type (I. 5) which can here be written as

w+kdw/dx = K, (A. 10)
EB the fictitious point in figure 1 can now readily be obtained from table 1. Taking r = 4 for
example, it easily follows from the table and equation (A. 10) that the required expression
m - .

Substitution of this expression in the finite-difference equation (A. 6) now gives the equation
