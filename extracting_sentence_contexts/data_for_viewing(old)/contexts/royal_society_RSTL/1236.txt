men ruminate ; their doing s0 is not material to the present
inquiry, since their stomachs are not of that kind which makes
rumination a necessary part of the process. of digestion ; and
as far as I can learn from some persons who feed rabbits and
fatten them with meal, although they have watched their
rabbits with attention they never saw them bring up the food
into the mouth. It may therefore be only occasional when
they eat particular kinds of vegetables. They have indeed a
mode of working their lips when sitting quiet, which may
have been mistaken for rumination. When it takes place in
men it must be considered as a disease.

From the facts which have been tated, the following gra-
dation of ruminating stomachs is established.

The ruminants with horns, as the bullock, sheep, &c.
have two preparatory stomachs for the food previous to ru-
mination, and one for the food to. be received in after rumi-
nation before it is digested.

The ruminants without horns, as the camel, dromedary,
and Tama, have one preparatory stomach before rumination,
and, properly speaking, none in which the cud can be after-
wards retained before it goes into the digesting stomach.
