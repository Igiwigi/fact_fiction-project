threshold and some critical value of \Eg? x2 1074. At higher intensities, the amplitude of
the edge state becomes strong enough to be attracted by the upper bistable branch, leading to
spontaneous generation of two kinks at the edges of the chain [7].

Within the homogeneous excitation, solitons always stand at rest regardless their width
because the effective periodic potential created by the chain requires a finite value of the applied
external force to start soliton motion [32]. In order to study soliton mobility, we excite the chain
by the tilted light incidence: Et = Ey exp(—iQdn), where 0 < Qd < kod = 0.7. Characteristic results
are summarized in figure 4b-d.

Figure 4b shows soliton velocity as a function of Qd. Interestingly, the threshold value of
Qd, when the soliton starts to move, depends on IEC, but this dependency is not monotonic.
This can be explained by the fact that Ej contributes to both the chain potential and the force
acting on the soliton; whereas Qd contributes only to the force. Another interesting feature of
the velocity dependence on Qd is its non-monotonic character: instead of expected continuous
growth (because increasing Qd corresponds to the rise of the applied force), we observe a slight

decrease when Q approaches kp. We attribute this phenomenon to MI which extends over all
bistability region for Q ~ ko [9] and results in formation of small-amplitude background, which
inhibits soliton motion.
