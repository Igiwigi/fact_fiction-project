A large majority of pixels in the images
show clear evidence of cooling plasma, presumably in the aftermath of nanoflares, though not all
the plasma along the line of sight need be cooling. The time lags are seen even in channels with
widely separated temperature, implying that the nanoflares have low frequency. The fact that a
clear signal can be detected seems rather amazing when one realizes that the emission in each
pixel comes from many hundreds to thousands of unresolved strands. Modelling shows that the
technique is expected to see a cooling signature even with such extreme averaging [28]. Intermediate to high-frequency heating is needed to explain active region cores with steep EM
slopes.
