the violet and ultra-violet in which the strongesb impressions occur could not
be in proper focus. The solar line F, and everything which is below, are well defined.
Â© Th is clear that with this instrument we obtain a series of rings corresponding to the
different rays sent ont by the prominences. We are ab once struck by the intensity
of two of these rings lying close together near the boundary between the violet and
ultra-violet. A comparison with the photographs obtained in the spectroscopic
camera leaves no doubt that these rings are due to calcium, and are in fact coinci-
dent with the solar lines H and K. They may serve therefore as a starting-point for
the determination of other wave-lengths. Measurements of the distances between the
different prominence rings, and comparison with a, photograph of the solar spectrum,
Qaken with the same prism, renders it easy to identify the hydrogen lines, He (C),
SHB (F), Hy (near G), and HS (h), and these may again stand as reference lines for

e other images.

S Three prominences especially are noticeable by their great intensity. We
