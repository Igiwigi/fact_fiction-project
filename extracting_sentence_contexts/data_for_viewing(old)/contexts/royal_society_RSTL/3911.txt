continuously.

As it happens that in the declination the variation resulting from the moon's action
is greater, relatively to the instrumental means for measuring it, than either in the
inclination or in the total force, it is reasonable to conclude that we have a better
opportunity of judging of the particular nature and character of the noon's mag-
netic influence, by studying the effects produced on the declination than those pro-
duced on either of the other elements.

Referring to the Table (Table IV. p. 503) which exhibits the coefficients of all the
twelve terms in the formula of sines and cosines by which the results of observation
are strictly represented, we perceive that the coefficient of the cosine of twice the
hour-angle is not only the one of greatest account, but is in fact the only one which
we can with confidence regard as possessed of a substantial value. All the other
coeflicients are, without, exception, not only extremely small in comparison with the
one above noticed, but are s0 small, that they may well be supposed to represent such
small deviations from a natural law as may well be ascribed to errors which cannot
wholly be extinguished in averages derived from not more than six years of observa-
tion. On the other hand, the coefficient in the second term has a value far beyond
any explanation resting on the supposition of errors of observation. The probable
error at any single hour is 1-37, whilst the range of the variation is not less than 38‚Äù.
Whilst, therefore, the general result of this investigation is to establish conclusively
the existence of a lunar-magnetic influence sensible at the surface of the earth, the
lunar-diurnal variation which is thus manifested appears to be consistent with the
bypothesis that the moon's magnetism may be, in great part at least if not wholly,
