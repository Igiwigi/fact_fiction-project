trie discharge 80 immensely superior to all others? and are there no means of estimating
its real amount? Two of the facts which I have noted respecting these discharges may
at least direct attention to this snbject. In general the spectra of the simple spark of
an induction machine are much fainter than when a jar, however 8mall, is connected
with it; and those with a small jar than those with a large. Thus, with silver elec-
trodes in air, the spark gave twenty-three lines, of which 3 and 09 were © very bright;” a
jar of 0-5 foot coating gave also twenty-three, but differently placed, more at the red,
fewer at the violet, but seven of them #8; the normal one of 1:25 foot gave thirty-one,
with nine #s; and two large of 8-5 feet gave thirty-six, with ten #s and many others
