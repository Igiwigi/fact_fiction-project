It follows from this analysis that the most primitive known Elasmobranch pectoral
fin, from which all others can be derived, is that of Cladoselache, and that the most
striking of its characters are the parallelism, extension nearly to the fin margin, and
unjointed nature of the radials, and the parallel series of short basals. I have shown that the best known Acanthodian pectoral fin (that of Acanthodes) is
tribasal and has extremely short jointed radials. In fact it resembles a type of fin, found
only in Mesozoic or still later Elasmobranchs, which is the result of a long evolutionary
process. The pectoral fin of the Lower Devonian Ischnacanthus clearly agrees in its
general structure with that of Acanthodes. So that even the earlier Acanthodians cannot
be compared with the very much more recent primitive Elasmobranchs.
