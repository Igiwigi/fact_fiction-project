Figure 2. Heavy element mass fraction Z versus planetary mass up to a mass of 20 Mg. The solid-black and dotted-blue curves
correspond to formation models assuming solid surface densities of 10 g cm~? and 6 g cm~, respectively. This demonstrates
the dependence of the planetary composition and primordial internal structure on the relative accretion rates (see Helled &
Stevenson [66] for details). (Online version in colour.)

and corresponding artists conceptions, it is unlikely that they are fully differentiated objects with
distinct layers. Although it is often assumed that they are water-rich, their composition is poorly
constrained as discussed in Helled et al. [13,63]. Also, since they are not H-He dominated, the
chosen materials and their distribution significantly affects the inferred composition. Planets in
this mass regime are in fact most sensitive to the assumed planetary internal structure and the
equation of state (EOS) used by the modeller (e.g. Baraffe et al. [64], Vazan et al. [65]).

Planet formation models suggest that deep interiors of gaseous planets are expected to consist
of composition gradients, although this is just started to be included in current structure models.
During the planetary growth phase the accreted heavy elements (pebbles and/or planetesimals)
are dissolved in the envelope already when the core mass reaches a few Earth masses (Ma).
An example for such a gradient has been presented in Helled & Stevenson [66], who also note
that the more gradual structure is associated with a lower solid surface density. As a result, the
primordial interior of Uranus and Neptune are expected to have a large region with composition
gradients. Figure 2 shows the heavy-element mass fraction as a function of planetary mass during
the planetary growth when assuming two different solid surface densities. â€˜These curves are
not meant to represent proto-Uranus/Neptune but to demonstrate the sensitivity of the inferred
