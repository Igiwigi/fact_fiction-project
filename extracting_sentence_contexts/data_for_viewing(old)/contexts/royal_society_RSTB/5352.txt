the slender plant “climbed” on the larger stems of plants of other classes. The
present investigation shows that the Sphenophyllales were hardly ever present in the
shales when plants of the class Lycopodiales were dominant. On the other hand,
they were found in good number when fern and fernlike plants were numerous.

If the association of the different classes has any significance, this would seem to
indicate that the Sphenophyllales were a class of plants adapted for dry-land conditions.
Again, if the probable conditions of growth of the different classes of plants were as stated,
we can regard the Lycopodiales as a wet flora, and the ferns and fernlike plants as repre-
senting the dry flora, the Equisetales as damp flora, and Cordaitales with greater power
of adaptation as suited for both damp and dry conditions of growth.

The fact, as already stated, was that the two classes Lycopodiales and Filicales and
Pteridosperms were found to re-act one upon the other, that is, the one class being
almost absent when the other classes became dominant, and also the second fact that
the Equisetales and Cordaitales were not influenced in a marked manner, whichever of
the two classes, namely, the Filicales and Pteridosperms or the Lycopodiales were
dominant.



THE COAL MEASURES IN EAST GLAMORGANSHIRE. 135

The two classes Equisetales and Cordaitales seem to hold a position for growth
between the two extremes of wet and dry, represented by the Lycopodiales on the one
