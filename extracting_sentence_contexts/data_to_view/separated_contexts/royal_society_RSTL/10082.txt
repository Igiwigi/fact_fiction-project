The layer of protoplasm (primordial utricle) lining the cell-wall
is thin, and the central vacuole is large. In consequence of this, very great shrinking
of the protoplasm is possible, and experience shows that the 8nccessful preservation of
this tissue is extremely difficult. Any reagents causing the least diffusion very 800n
affect the protoplasm, and the only at all successful treatment is brought about by

* Tho fact deserves notice that in the cases where the protoplagm displays* any great activity of
function, the cells of s8nch a tissue usually contain tannin. For example, pulyini of Mimosa Robinia,
Desmodium, &e., leaf of Dioncea, Drosera. Again in galls, where a stimulation of the protoplasm
followed by rapid growth occurs.
