inferred that these hormones, formed in response to a stimulus from the anterior pituitary
gland, normally induce spermatogenesis.

(2) Mitotic activity in the mouse body

Having considered the effects exerted within the ovary by that part of the oestrogenic
hormone which is passed with the follicular fluid into the antrum, it is now necessary to
consider the effect on the rest of the body of that part of the hormone which enters the blood
stream. It is generally considered that the principal function of the oestrogenic hormone
secreted by the ovary is the maintenance in a suitable condition of the accessory sexual
organs and the secondary sexual characters. In the mouse, these hormones, by means of
induced mitosis, cause enlargement of the Fallopian tube, uterus, and vagina, as well as
of the mammary gland. This is indicated by the well-known fact that the removal of the
ovaries results in the atrophy of these organs, an effect which may be reversed by means
of oestrone injections (see review by Allen, Hisaw & Gardner 1939). Certainly the acces-
sory and secondary sexual organs are especially sensitive to the influence of the oestrogens,
and the study of their responses has monopolized this field of research for many years. The
result has been that these hormones have come to be regarded as almost exclusively con-
cerned with oestrous phenomena in the female sex so that they are referred to as oestrogenic
or female sex hormones, and recognized and standardized by means of the response of the
lining epithelium of the vagina. However, it is also known that in many vertebrates
unusual tissues and organs have become involved, for various reasons, in the mechanism
for sexual reproduction. Thus, in some monkeys, the skin around the anus and external
genitalia becomes thickened under the influence of oestrogenic and androgenic substances,
just as in the cock, Gallus gallus L., the skin on the head is gr√©atly developed into comb and
