This result means that V is a Lyapunov function for the synchronization dynamical equations
(4.2) and (4.3), and therefore the state 2 = 0 is globally asymptotically stable. We conclude that the two oscillation points A and B must synchronize under the assumption
(4.1). In fact, using equation (4.7), we find that

dV AV, (4.8)
drâ€™ ,

and so we arrive at an exponentially fast decay for V:
V<Voe*, (4.9)

where Vo is a constant. Therefore, all trajectories Q(t) flow downhill toward the state 2 =0
exponentially fast, and synchronization is stable asymptotically.

(b) More general shear-magnitudes relations

We may somewhat extend this argument as follows. Suppose that in place of the assumption (4.1),
we start by assuming a more general form,

p=aq, a constant. (4.10)
Then introducing the functions
2% = Ey alls, (4.11)
the synchronization equations (4.2) and (4.3) become
Qi, = 224 + q@Ak, (4.12)
and so introducing the function V as before, we see that its derivative satisfies,

1dv

dp = UME + 22) + (21 2F + 22%), (4.13)
T

We can now show that this leads to another Lyapunov function for synchronized dynamics.
