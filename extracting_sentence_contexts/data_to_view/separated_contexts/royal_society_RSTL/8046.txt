Cor. 1. The line LM is a generator of the reciprocal of U'Y”—U'Y!,

Cor. 2, The quadric U'V'—U"V' is the hyperboloid generated by the polar lines of
LM with respect to all the quadrics of the pencil U+FV. In fact the polar lines form
one system of generators, and the intersection of the polar planes of art. 222 the other
system of generators,
