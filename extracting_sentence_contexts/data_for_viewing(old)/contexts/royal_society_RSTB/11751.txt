haps this could be cast as a non-conscious priming effect, but a
further experiment seems to confirm that, in some patients
responses of this kind are reports and reflect consciousness.
Patients who responded as above were instructed to imagine
playing tennis in order to answer ‘yes’, and to imagine walking
around the house in order to answer ‘no’, in response to ques-
tions such as ‘Do you have any brothers?’ One patient’s
responses corresponded to correct answers.

Why is it so compelling that this patient was conscious?
Monti et al. suggest a natural answer, characterizing her
responses as ‘willful’ communication. On the face of it at
least, the fact that the responses corresponded to correct
answers can be explained only if they were intentional actions,
reflecting a decision made on the basis of the instructions and
questions. That is evidence that the patient was conscious,

insofar as decisions of this kind require consciousness of the
basis for action.

The suggestion that decisions of this kind require conscious-
ness can be fleshed out using some ideas from the philosophical
literature. Intentional action is often understood as action for
reasons [45]. For instance, the instructions and the question
are among the patient’s reasons for imagining playing tennis.
