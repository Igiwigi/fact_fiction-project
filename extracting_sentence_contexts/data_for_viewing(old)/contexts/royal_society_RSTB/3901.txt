Nore.—In this and all succeeding tables each tabulated figure is an average of the estimates for three
cardiac cycles (with the exception of observations upon the vagus), and represents the time difference
in seconds between the appearance of a particular deflection ahd the first deflection recorded over the
S-—A node in the same heart.

Tue Priwum Movens.

In papers published from this Laboratory (7 and 9),it has been stated that the
excitatory process commences in the neighbourhood of the upper reaches of the
sulcus terminalis in the dog, and at a point immediately overlying the broad and
thick part of the sino-auricular node which lies immediately beneath the endocardium
in this region. This conclusion was based upon (1) the fact that the normal outline
of P in Lead IT is only reproduced when the auricle is stimulated in the region of the
node ; and (2) upon the observation that this region becomes electro-negative, relative
to all immediately surrounding points, as the auricle is passing into its contraction ;
this being the only region on the superficies of the right auricle which exhibits this
phenomenon, It seemed to us, therefore, to be the point of origin of the excitation
wave, and of auricular activity, activity being associated with relative negativity
