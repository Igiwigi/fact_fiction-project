Parr III. Cuancre or Conpucriviry on MEttina. Combining the last result with the one obtained for solids, Part I., and with the fact
that solids in general conduct heat better than liquids, and liquids better than gases,
we are led to conjecture that a given substance will, as its temperature is increased,
decrease in conductivity, and that the decrease will continue during any change of
state which the substance may undergo, owing to the increase in temperature. ‘The

question then arises : Is there any sudden change in the conductivity as the substance
passes from one physical state to another, or is this change continuous ?
