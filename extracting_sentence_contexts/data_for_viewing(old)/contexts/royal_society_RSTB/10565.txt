and variability of exemplars (e.g. [14,15]).

The breadth of statistical learning phenomena demon-
strates that this is a powerful learning mechanism, consistent
with theories of development that place a more pronounced
emphasis on learning as an important causal factor in develop-
mental change (e.g. [16,17]). At the same time, however, these
phenomena present a challenge to theories of statistical learn-
ing themselves: whatever mechanism or process underlies
statistical learning must be able to account for learning in a
wide variety of stimuli, tasks and statistical structure. In
response to this variation, recent theories have suggested that
statistical learning is in fact an umbrella term that describes
the action of multiple independent mechanisms (e.g. [18]).
Some of these theories suggest that there are different statistical
learning mechanisms operating in different modalities, such
that audio and visual statistical learning are accomplished by
separate learning mechanisms (e.g. [19]). Others have
suggested that different statistical structures are learned via
different mechanisms, for example proposing a distinction
between conditional statistics such as transitional probabilities,
and distributional statistics such as frequency and variability
(e.g. [20]). The goal of the remainder of this article is to provide
a brief descriptive overview of the range of statistical learning
tasks, and describe a modelling framework that can potentially
