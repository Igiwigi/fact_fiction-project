1. Background

Author for correspondence: It is an open question why an elephant, with 100x more cells than a human, or
Aleah F. Caulin a whale with 1000x more cells than a human, has approximately the same (or
e-mail: aleah.caulin@gmail.com lower) cancer risk as a human [1]. This is Peto’s paradox, and though many

potential solutions have been proposed, it remains unsolved [2-5]. The fact
that cancer rates are approximately constant across body sizes and lifespans
suggests that there has been selection on the life histories of organisms to pre-
vent cancer in large, long-lived organisms [2,3]. In order to investigate Peto’s
paradox, it would be helpful to understand how much evolution would have
to change the parameters of somatic evolution to compensate for the evolution
of large bodies and long lifespans. For example, we can ask how much the
somatic mutation rate must decrease in order for a whale, which has 1000x
more cells than a human, to retain the same cancer risk as a human.
Computational models of cancer risk [3,6-10] can be used in comparative
oncology to estimate how cancer risk should scale across body size and life-
span, and to test how much mutation rate, generation time, number of stem
cells and the number of mutations would have to evolve to compensate for
