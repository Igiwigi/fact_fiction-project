plates of Beocaria,strongly adhere to
each other when oppositely charged, /and retain their charges
on being separated. This fact affords a distinct analogy to the
subject ; different particles 'in combining must still be sup-
posed to preserve their peculiar states of energy. In the present early stage of the investigation, it would be
improper to place' unbounded confidence in this hypothesis ;
but it seems naturally to arise from the facts,-and to coincide
with the laws of affinity, s0 ably, developed by modern
chemists; and - the general application, of it may be easily
made. 4
