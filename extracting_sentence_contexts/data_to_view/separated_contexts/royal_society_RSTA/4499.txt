The existing structure, which from the refined
character of its architecture seems to require a date of about the middle of the fifth
century B.c. (which was also the epoch of a flourishing period among the Greek cities
of Sicily), appears never to have been completely finished. As for the original founda-
tion, if we accept the tradition countenanced by Tuucyprprs that the city was
founded by refugees from Troy, the probability of the foundation of a temple in
honour of Jupiter a century or more earlier does not require much argument. At Agrigentum, with the exception of the temple attributed to Juno Lacinia,

which has been already referred to, the astronomic and historical dates of the temples
are in very close correspondence, Droporvs informs us that the spoils obtained by the
Agrigentines in their victory over the Carthaginians at Himera, B.c. 480,* enabled
the inhabitants to embellish their city, but that afterwards they were in turn defeated,
their city taken, and their power destroyed in 406, and that the great Temple of
Jupiter, which had been completed with the exception of its roof, remained hence-
forth unfinished.t From these facts, in his contribution to the ‘Supplementary
Volume’ of Sruarr and Revert, Professor CockERELL argues that that temple
would probably have been commenced twenty years earlier. The orientation dates
found for the Temples of Hercules, Concord, and Jupiter are respectively 470, 452,
and 439 B.c. These dates, therefore, accord as strictly with the dates derived from
historical probability as they do with the architectural character of the remains, Of
three temples at Syracuse two fall within the historic period, and the other might be
bronght within it by a slight adjustment of the elements.
