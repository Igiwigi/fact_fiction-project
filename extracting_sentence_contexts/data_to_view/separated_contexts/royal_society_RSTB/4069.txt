The closing membrane, which consists of fused ectoderm and
entoderm, is much thinner than in Trichosurus, and, as in the latter, its upper
portion lies above the dorsal margin of the sinus. Within the sinus on the left
side, it is broken open, and ventrally disappears altogether, so that the pouch
communicates with the exterior for a distance of approximately 0°20 mm. ; on the

right, however, it appears to be open along the whole lateral extent, that is, for
0°36 mm. Considering the fact that the closing membrane of this pouch is
completely closed throughout its extent in the next stage, the opening here is very
probably an artificial one. The third -pouch is shorter than the second, is cranio-caudally flattened and
possesses a small ventral diverticulum, but no dorsal one. The closing membrane
has a dorso-ventral measurement of 0°20 mm.
