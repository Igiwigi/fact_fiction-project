To calculate the minimal
possible work, we can decompose the composite map into any sequence of thermodynamically
reversible maps that achieves the same thing. So we can start with a (thermodynamically
reversible) map (1) taking {a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA string plus a bath of nucleotides}
â€” {that same DNA string, plus a specific sequence of nucleotides in an mRNA that is a copy
of the DNA string, plus the remaining nucleotides in the bath}. We can suppose that after this
map (1), there is a (many-to-one) thermodynamically reversible map (2) taking the codons in the
mRNA to a (fictional) sequence of amino acids, formed from the amino acid bath. After this there
is a map (3) copying that sequence of amino acids to produce our protein. Our analysis above
considers the minimal work needed to achieve map (3).
