These results do not agree with the view of physiology, according to which the
generative power should remain for some time at the same height. But we ought
not te lose sight of the fact that the legitimate fertility is to be regarded as the
resultant of two different forces. The number of children born in a family is, in fact,
not a consequence of the physiological power only, but also of the wish to have
offspring. In a family where children already exist, the wish for the increase of them
is weaker and will be weaker, the greater the number of offspring. Now as the number
of children increases with advancing age, the force of the moral factor increases also
with the age.
