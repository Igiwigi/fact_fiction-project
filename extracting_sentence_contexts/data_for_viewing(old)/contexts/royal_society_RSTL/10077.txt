Another important character is that the palatal and vomerine bones seem to have
bristled with teeth, mostly of very small size ; but, there are als some larger palatal
teeth, of which some are sharply pointed and others blunt with furrowed points.

The vertebrz are of the game type with those of Zylonomns; but 8ome which appear
to be caudal have a pointed spine above, indicating perhaps a flattened tail. The ribs
are short and stout.

Only a few fragments of the limbs have been found ; they would seem to have been
less developed than in Zylonomus, and perhaps this animal was less gifted with
powers of walking on land than any of the other Microsauria. This would accord
with the fact that its bones are much scattered, and occur chiefly in sandy layers, as if
introduced in times of rain or of partial inundation. o

Some fragments indicate thoracic plates, and there are numerous abdominal scales of
oval form. Above, the body appears to have been clothed with small tubercles and
horny scales, and to have had cuticular pendants like those of Dendrerpeton.

In a large specimen the mandible measures 2:2 centimetres, the femur 2 centimetres,

and a rib the xame. The following are measurements from a 8maller specimen â€”
