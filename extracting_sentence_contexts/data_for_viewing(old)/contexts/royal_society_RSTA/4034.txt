Within a year of fullerenes being discovered, Kroto et al. [1] was the famous theory paper that

discussed how C¢y isomers could be interconverted through rotations of bonded atom pairs about : a
the centre of their bond [2] in what has become known as the Stone—-Wales (SW) transformation. : Ss
The paper underlined the problem that the process is forbidden by the Woodward—Hoffman : z
tules [3] for pericyclic reactions if treated on a par with standard organic reaction chemistry, and 1B
would be difficult even if allowance is made for the extreme conditions of fullerene synthesis :S

and condensation. This was an obstacle for understanding the experimental observation of the
I, isomer and none other, as proved by the first Ceo 13C NMR [4], which comprised a single line
arising from a single chemical environment shared by all atoms. The fact that the I), isomer has
global thermodynamic stability for Cgég was understood in terms of the isolated pentagon rule :
(IPR), although a strong indication was given in [2] that many other isomers are energetically =
similar to the J, one and should be observed. a
The isomers of Cgq were enumerated [5] and it was apparent that the transformation from 8
an arbitrary isomer to the Ij, isomer must proceed through the C2, isomer, so most calculations :
focused on this step. The ab initio calculations gave two different saddle points: symmetrical ia
and asymmetrical involving sp* carbon [6], but both still with very high activation barriers Dw
(respectively, 8.4 and 6.9 eV, taking the highest level of theory at the time: 4s2pl1d/BLYP and :
the largest Co fragment). The asymmetrical transition state was later dismissed as an artefact —
of lower levels of theory in a comprehensive review and revision [7], which concluded that the aes)
activation barrier was 6.9-7.3 eV through the symmetrical state. :
