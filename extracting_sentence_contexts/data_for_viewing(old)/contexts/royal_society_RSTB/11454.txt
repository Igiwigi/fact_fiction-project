1. Introduction

Odours give rise to primary sensory experiences. Every time we inhale we use our
sense of smell to make sense of our environment. Odours are used to detect and
identify foods, to avoid environmental hazards, and they enable social communi-
cation [1,2]. We can identify the source of a gas leak or navigate towards (or away
from!) a department store perfume counter by using our sense of smell alone [3].
In fact, people can track a 10 m long scent trail of chocolate through a field [4]. Our
ability to detect odours is so keen that the odorant ethyl mercaptan (which gives
gas its distinctive smell) can be detected at concentrations equivalent to three
drops diluted in an Olympic-size swimming pool [5].

Despite evidence of humans having such keen noses, it has been claimed
that like other abstract domains—such as time or emotion—odours are difficult
to conceptualize. We may be able to detect whether an odour is present or not,
or follow it to its source using intensity gradients, but many doubt we can think
olfactorily. The Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid claimed: ‘It is evidently ridi-
culous, to ascribe to it [the smell]' figure, colour, extension, or any other quality
