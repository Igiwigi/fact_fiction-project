Figure 4 shows the comparison of the present model with the predictions of Wang ef al.
and experimental data obtained from samples processed by an electromagnetic levitator on the
Ground [27,63] and under microgravity generated during parabolic flights [60,62]. It can be seen
that the solid line calculated by the full model (4.1)-(4.8) describes the whole set of experimental
data including the abrupt drop in the velocity at the critical undercooling AT ~311K. If we
exclude the local non-equilibrium effect of the relaxation of the gradient flow, ie. tg > 0 and
Vg > 00 in equations (4.7) and (4.8), the square root will yield unity in equation (4.5) and we get
the velocity as plotted by the dotted line in figure 4. More specifically, it is shown in the insert of
figure 4 how the predicted velocity lies far from the experimental data if the local non-equilibrium
effect in the phase field dynamics is not taken into account.

The necessity to introduce the gradient flow of the phase field as an additional thermodynamic
variable (see appendix B) lies in the fact that with the increase of undercooling in glass-forming
alloy one can find a transition from single atoms and single clusters to chains of connected clusters
(see data of molecular dynamics simulations in [64]). Such chains represent long molecules
