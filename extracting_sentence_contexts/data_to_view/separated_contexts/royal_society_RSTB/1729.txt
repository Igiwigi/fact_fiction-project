MM. Berrranp and Renavrr have expressed on purely theoretical grounds a
somewhat similar view of the origin of the Cycadean type of bundle, and they also
have cited Lyginodendron for comparison, relying not on any original investigations
but on the figures published in Wiirtamson’s Memoir IV. They have, however,
‘misunderstood the structure, owing to their assumption that the whole of the
centrifugal wood is secondary and the whole of the primary wood centripetal. This,
as we have shown, is not in accordance with the facts. It is, to.a great extent,
in consequence of this error that they are led to derive Lyginodendron and Heter-
angium, as well as their own genus Poroxylon, from Lycopodiaces, a conclusion
which, as regards the genera investigated by us, is completely negatived by the
whole organization of the leaf, while it is quite unnecessary as an explanation of
the stem-structure. *
