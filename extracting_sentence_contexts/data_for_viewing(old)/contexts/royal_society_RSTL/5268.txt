sufficiently pure to assume a crystalline form, and has the appearance of an amor-
pbous yellow powder. By exposing it to heat, however, a crystalline sublimate of
rubiadine may be obtained.

The acid liquid filtered from the mixture of the four preceding substances till
contains in s0lution another product of decomposition. After neutralizing the sul-
pburic acid with carbonate of lead, and evaporating the filtered liquid to dryness, a
residue is left, which is treated with alcohol. This leaves undissolved the sulphate
of soda, and after filtration and evaporation gives a brown glutinous mass, which
has all the properties of the sugar produced by the action of acids on rubian. It is
this sugar, which, by the continued action on it of the caustic alkali, gives rise to the
formation of the dark brown flocculent substance, insoluble in alcohol, which is found
mixed with the four preceding products of decomposition. This fact is sufficiently
proved by the composition of the latter substance, which is identical with that of the
brown substance produced by the action of strong acids on ordinary sugar.


MR. SCHUNCK, ON RUBIAN. AND ITS PRODUCTS OF DECOMPOSITION. 69

The Products, formed by the action of caustic baryta on rubian do-not differ from
those resulting from the,action of caustic soda. On adding caustic baryta to a-80lu-
tion of rubian and boiling for some time, the rubian. is, entirely decomposed; the
decompoxition, as might be supposed, requiring. a \rather longer time for-its com-
pletion than in the, case of caustic 80da.,, After the, process is finished, the products
of decompoxition are found for the most part/in.combination with baryta in the shape
