From these equations we can detect at once a solution in a particular case, viz.,
the flux through a circular hole in a plane wall, when the result we have already
obtained on p. 509, viz., y¥ = — Va?/3 .q° (a being the radius of the hole, and V the
velocity at its‘centre) still applies. In fact, the tangential stress at any point of the
wall is zero.

But it is obvious that it is out of the question to apply, in general, the direct method
of assuming (69) and substituting, in order to find functions which satisfy (79) and
(79a), and it is also clear that the solution for the spheroid is not, as in the case of the
sphere, of like simplicity with the case when the slipping is zero. In one case I
have followed out the process of solution, viz., when the obstacle is a circular disc, and
the slipping slight. We then have py) = 0, and
