no part here, and in truth no one knows what the nature of the operation is.

Notwithstanding the observations of LEopoxp (1880) to the contrary, it is improbable
that either external or internal migration takes place in the rabbit. The occurrence of
internal migration is highly improbable, for the rabbit uterus is strictly bipartite and it
is extremely unlikely that an egg from the uterus of one side could pass into the cavity
of the vagina, cross this space, and enter the uterus of the other side. External migra-
tion in the rabbit is not so unlikely, but Parxes’ careful experimental tests (1924), all
of which were followed with negative results, led him to conclude that this type of
translocation was very rare in the rabbit, if in fact it occurred at all. He is probably
correct in attributing Leopotp’s declaration of positive results to some oversight in
experimental procedure, such as the regeneration of an ovary supposed to have been
completely removed. But, notwithstanding the fact that the eggs of rabbits are more
restricted in their range of movements than those of most other mammals, they never-
theless do distribute themselves through some seven to eight centimetres of uterine
tube on their own side, by means that, so far as can be seen, must be purely muscular.
After the rabbit embryos have reached full term they are born through being expelled
from the uterus by what is essentially a vigorous peristalsis which, as observed by
Lupwie and Lenz (1923) through a Karscu-Borcuers’ abdominal window, takes place
first in one uterus and then in the other. Thus the downward passage of egg and
embryo in the rabbit is much simpler than the upward passage of its sperms. In the
region of the uterine tube the movement of the egg is accomplished through the com-
bined action of cilia and of muscles, and in that of the uterus and the vagina through
muscles alone.
