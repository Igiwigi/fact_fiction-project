A small amount of connective tissue is also present. Groups of powerful
radial muscles are very prominent and pass outwards to be attached to the neigh-
bouring body-wall (fig. 62). When filled with waste material, the rectum is capable
of a large amount of distension, which is due to the fact that, at definite locations,
there are deep folds in its walls. The latter are much thinner and more flexible at
these positions than elsewhere, and allow either for the rectum to be distended when
full, or to remain in a flattened or collapsed condition, when empty. Around the
anus the structure of the rectal wall undergoes alteration.
