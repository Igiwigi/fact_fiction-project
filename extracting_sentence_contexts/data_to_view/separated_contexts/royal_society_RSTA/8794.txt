These
have already been shown to be 1S—1p.3; (b) shows these two lines, and in addition
nine other lines (one is not visible in the reproduction on account of its low intensity). These are precisely the nine lines of the multiplet just described ; the strong arc lines
not belonging to this multiplet are not present at this middle stage of temperature. Hence the preceding facts may be summarised as follows: At the lowest temperature
two lines appear, namely 1S—1p,,,; at the intermediate temperature the nine lines
