In this literature, wealth can be understood to refer to
any resource that can be passed on across generations and that ‘can affect an
individual’s health, well-being and RS [reproductive success]’ [1, p. 190]. In pas-
toral and agricultural societies, material wealth (like livestock, tools and land) is
centrally important. The fact that the material of wealth can be defended and
transferred across generations relatively easily means that inequality is more
likely to persist in such societies. In horticultural and hunter-gatherer societies,
‘wealth’ more often takes the form of social relationships and connections, or
embodied, physical, skills and attributes, which are less reliably protected
and transferred, making inequality less persistent in such societies. These ‘technological’ differences, however, do not tell the whole story.
