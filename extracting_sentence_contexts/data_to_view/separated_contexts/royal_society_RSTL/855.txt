that a bruise upon the
nerves of the tongue, sufficient to deprive them of the power of
communicating sensation, was productive of no inflammation
or irritation in the nervous trunk, s0 as to induce spasms,
which too commonly occur from injuries to the nerves belong-
ing to voluntary muscles. I am therefore led to believe, that
the nerves supplying an organ of sense, are not $0 liable to
such effects as those which belong to the other parts of
the body. The small degree of mischief which was produced, and the
readiness with which the nerves had their communication com-
pletely cut off, were to me new facts, and encouraged me, in
the following case of fungous excrescence from the tongue,
which bled s0 profusely as at times to endanger the patient's life,
and never allowed him to arrive at a state of tolerable health,
to attempt removing the part by ligature. Jonn WEeymovurn, eight years of age; was admitted into St.
George's hospital, on the 24th of December, 1800, on account
of a fungous excrescence on the right side of the anterior part
of the tongue, which extended nearly from the outer edge to
the middle line at the tip. It appeared, from the account of his
relations, that the origin of this fungus existed at his birth, and
had been increasing ever since.
