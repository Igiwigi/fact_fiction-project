with d suppressed since P,,,,,,, has been written equal to P,,_,_,,, because of symmetry
about the equator. Examination of the formulae shows that this modification takes care of all the
conditions to be satisfied arising from the fact that the values of the elevations are
symmetrical about the equator for semidiurnal tides. The above formulae have been used in the main computations of this paper, but for
the special investigations of the tides in very narrow oceans it was found necessary to use
the more accurate formula
