true temperature of' the upper surface of the bulb on which
the deposition of-dew takes place, but that of the lower part
to which the ether-is applied ; it may be' answered, that by
inclining the whole instrument so as to render the axis of the
bulb horizontal, and establish thereby a free circulation of
the mercury/in every part, this objection may be obviated ;
but on repeated 'trials I have not found this to produce any
difference in'the results.

I ought also perhaps to-mention that an instrument some-
what similarire principle has been -used in Vienna, and was
mentioned by Professor BAUMGARTEN of that capital to a
friend, who communicated the fact to myself.

The instrument is represented in Plate. Fig: 1.
