THE SENSITIVENESS OF EXPLOSIVES 199

The extent to which ‘physical’ methods of initiation involve factors (a) and (b) varies
from case to case. ‘Sympathetic explosion’ of one charge by another some distance away
probably involves mainly the directed velocity factor (b) of the shock wave, whereas hot
spots (cf. part III (1)) in mechanical processes may involve chiefly factor (a). The disen-
tanglement of these factors in various sensitivity tests would be of definite value; various
attempts are discussed in what follows.

The phenomenon, that as the density of packing an explosive is increased, more power is
required to initiate detonation (cf. part II (2)), can be understood in the light of the fact that
local activation will not lead to detonation unless a wave front can be built up to satisfy the
hydrodynamic conditions of propagation. As the density increases, the increase in co-volume

requires higher pressures and temperatures for stable propagation of a detonation wave.

2 Critical conditions for the propagation of detonation

Explosives differ markedly in the distance over which chemical reaction must travel
“” before a stable wave is set up. The slow ‘pick up’ of T.N.T. may be adduced as an example.
= Again, explosives are phlegmatized by breaking up local concentrations to colloidal dimen-
5 sions (cf. part III (1)). It seems likely that more information on this important aspect of
5D sensitiveness is to be-obtained from experiments on liquid explosives, since with liquids,
