transistor where the current is passed one charge at a time, yielding basically
an ideal ability, in principle, to relate current to the number of charges and the
time interval of their passage. However, it will still take some effort to develop
the desired accuracy of mapping this nanoscopic current into the SI ampere.
The three electrical quantum effects have been used in a triangle fashion to
confirm the physics initially, and, with the enhanced confidence thus obtained,
we have already pressed on to use these quantum phenomena to provide our
electrical working standards, and through simple equations a route to the desirec
SI base standards.

But which exact scaling numbers are we to use? Is it acceptable for us to use
‘metrological constants’, combinations of physical constants such as e and h tha
are not precisely known in SI units? In fact, the developing consensus is to move
to making the physics numbers be the adopted values, and calculate out wha
our mass, energy and temperature units will be. The thoughtful utilization o
this large amount of data poses a very interesting task, deciding how best to
provide low uncertainty in the base units. This work is somewhat similar to the
task involved in the periodic analyses undertaken by CODATA (for the benefi
of readers from other fields, a list of abbreviations used in this article is given
in table 1), where the objective is to provide the best values of the physical
constants, especially including the effort needed to make the results consistent
to within the assigned errors—with the known physics relationships. However, the
current task of reworking the SI is substantially larger, because high precision for
some base quantities is of higher significance than for others. For example,
would not object if the uncertainty in the volt could be reduced somewhat by
