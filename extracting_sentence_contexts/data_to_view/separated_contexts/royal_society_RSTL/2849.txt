Hamrrox undertook to investigate what amount of alteration
in the values of A would account for those differences. He communicated his re-
searches in a letter to myself, with the values of x, and consequently those of @ and b,
thus altered. I have repeated the calculation for oil of cassia, but find this change
quite insufficient to remove the discrepancy ; and that, in fact, a much larger altera-
tion than could for a moment be allowed in Frauxnortr's data, must be supposed,
in order to produce any sensible effect.

3. The entire method of computation here followed, though founded on the exclu-
sion of those approximate suppositions which are allowed in the simpler formula, is
yet dependent on the omission of terms in the series for p beyond the three first*,

24 ; PROFESSOR POWELL ON THE DISPERSION OF LIGHT. Since in this analysis we know nothing of the values of the coefficients of this series,
but proceed solely by the elimination of them, it is till possible that in the neglected
terms we may find the means of explaining the observed discrepancy.
