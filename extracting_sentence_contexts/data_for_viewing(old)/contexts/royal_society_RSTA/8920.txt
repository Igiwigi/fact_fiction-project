It is interesting to note that the members of this series are not far removed from
the corresponding members of the sharp triplet series of magnesium, the terms being
closely similar in the two series.

Diffuse series, \p—md.—Kayser and Runce traced the first three members of this
series, as shown in Table I. The first in their list was composed of three lines,
4.13569-95, 3548-16 and 3531-95 (Rowland scale), and it was remarked that the triplet
was possibly more complex. There are in fact six other lines close to these three which
must certainly be considered to form part of the diffuse triplet. The wave-lengths
given for these lines by different observers differ considerably, as will be seen from
Table II. A difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped together in sets
of three, and in each set the lines are very close together ; also the lines are very diffuse .
and with a strong tendency to reversal, so that their resolution is difficult. In a further
attempt to improve the measures the best results were obtained in the third order
spectrum, using the are between carbon poles with a small quantity of manganese
salt in order to prevent the reversal of the lines by the vapour round the crater. The
results are shown in Plate 1, fig. 2. The original photograph is here enlarged about 12
diameters, but as the distances between the three sets are relatively very large, the
groups are not shown in their true positions in the Plate, but are placed at distances
proportional to their real separations.
