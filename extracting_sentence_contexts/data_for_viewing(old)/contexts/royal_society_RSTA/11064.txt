therefore be a channel of more rapid flow and diminished pressure, into which,
therefore, the neighbouring liquid will be drawn from either side. Thus a rib once
formed is in stable equilibrium, and will correspond to a jet at the edge of the rim.
This explains the persistence of the ribs when once established, and we may attribute
their regular distribution to the fact that they first originate in the spontaneous
segmentation of the annular rim at the edge of the advancing sheath. This
explanation receives unexpected confirmation in the appearance of the lop-sided
splashes of Series XX., in which we see, firstly, that the flutings are absent from that
part of the sheath which has left the sphere, and, secondly, we see how much higher
in every case the continuous film has risen in that part which has left the sphere than
in the part which has clung to it, and has been hindered by the viscous drag.
Especially is this the case in fig. 3, Series XXVI. (see p. 196),’where the liquid was
pure glycerine. The effect of the viscous drag is, in fact, most marked in the most

viscous liquid.

Influence of the Constants of the Liquid.

Finally, in confirmation of the general argument, we have the fact that with a
liquid of small density and surface tension, such as Alexandra oil, a much smaller
velocity of impact with a highly polished sphere is required to give “rough” splash
than with water, a liquid of greater density and surface tension, the reason being
without doubt that the tangential velocity due to the impact is greater with the less
dense liquid, as, indeed, is proved to be the case by the greater height to which the
surrounding sheath is thrown up, and the smaller the surface tension the less will he
