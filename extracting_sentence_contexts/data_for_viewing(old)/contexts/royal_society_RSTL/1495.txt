it came in” contact with the- air, and muriate of potash_ was
found dissolved in the mixture.

It seemed evident. from this fact, that in the _ action of
tellurium negatively. electrified upon potash, potassium was
produced as in all other cases, and that it combined with the
tellurium, and formed a peculiar alloy ; and this opinion was
farther confirmed, by the immediate action of potassium upon
tellurium. When these metals were gently heated in a retort
of green glass, filled with hydrogene gas, they combined with
great energy, producing most vivid heat and light, and they
composed an alloy of a dark copper hue, brittle, infusible at a
heat below redness, -and possessing a crystalline fracture,
When the tellurium- was in excess in this mixture, or even
nearly equal to the potassium' in quantity, no hydrogene was
evolved by the action of the alloy upon water ; but the com-
