and illegitimate stillborn children (information which is not to be obtained in this
country, and which, I may add, I have failed to induce our home authorities to
attempt to supply in their publications) ; and because they deal with two races living
on an island under similar conditions, the records for each of which are kept separate.

Dr. Fryuay, to whom I am greatly indebted for his courtesy in supplying me
regularly with this publication, is careful to inform me that the figures in the tables
referring to stillborn children, “in accordance with the Spanish law, do not only
express the number of children that are actually born dead but also those that die
within the first twenty-four hours after their birth.” This fact does not detract
from the value of these records for the purpose I have in view, but it should be noted.

Speaking generally, there is undoubtedly a very remarkable regularity in the
proportion of the sexes produced by various species of animals of which records have
been obtained, a regularity which is so pronounced that students of heredity are
surely justified in their belief that the laws of heredity are certainly concerned and,
in the main, govern that proportion. The fact that this proportion is different for
different species or for varieties of those species, while in the main stable for each, is
favourable to that view, and I shall bring forward evidence in this paper which cannot,
I think, be interpreted otherwise.

Darwin (1871) concluded “that natural selection will always tend, though
