The next difficulty which threatened to be serious was that due to the shimmering
produced by currents of unequally heated air. The distance between the two mirrors
of the refractometer cannot be indefinitely increased ; and the gradient of temperature
between the furnace and the air outside must necessarily be steep. In fact, the
whole fall of temperature occurred in a distance of about six inches. It appeared
probable that the mirage effects would make it impossible to read the bands. _ This
danger was, however, completely met by a device previously used by M. Le Roux.
