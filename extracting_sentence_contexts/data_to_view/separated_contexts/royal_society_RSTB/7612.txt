One of the consequences of the
increased interest in neurotrophic factors is that researchers from a wide range of disciplines are
now actively considering the potential role of these molecules on a number of different levels. There are therefore many, other than developmental biologists, actively working on trophic
factors, from biochemists working on signal transduction pathways to clinicians interested in
the potential of these molecules as therapeutic agents. In fact, the popularity of the
neurotrophins is reaching such a frenzied level that it seems likely that there will be a period
of unbridled enthusiasm in which researchers will fling neurotrophins at their own model
systems. We should be prepared for a few false positives. This volume is also one of the consequences of burgeoning multidisciplinary interest in the
neurotrophins.
