Jorgan.
=o SUCTORIAL DISC.
bh One of the most remarkable organs of the larval Lepidosteus is the suctorial dise,
Splaced at the front end of the head, to which we have made numerous allusions in the
'Sfirst 8ection of this memoir.
Z The external features of the dise have been fully dealt with by AGass1z, and he
Balso explained its function by observations on the habits of the larva. We have
Zulready quoted (p. 371) a pasxage from AGass1z' memoir showing how the young
'BFishes use the disc to attach themselves firmly to any convenient object, The discs
appear in fact to be highly efficient organs of attachment, in that the young Fish
Sean remain 8uspended by them to the sides of the jar, even after the water has
Zbeen lowered below the level at which they are attached.
EZ The dise is formed two or three days before hatching, and from Acass1z' state-
Ements, it appears bo come into use immediately the young Fish is liberated from the
HSegs membranes.
Â© We have examined the histological structure of the disc at various ages of its growth,
Sand may refer the reader to Plate 21, figs. 11 and 13, and Plate 24, figs. 40 and 44.
E The result of our examination has been to show that the disc is provided with a series
A of papillze often exhibiting a bilateral arrangement. The papillee are mainly con-
stituted of highly modified cells of the mucous layer of the epidermis. 'These cells
have the form of elongated columns, the nucleus being placed at the buse, and the
main mass of the cells being filled with a protoplasmic reticulum. They may probably
