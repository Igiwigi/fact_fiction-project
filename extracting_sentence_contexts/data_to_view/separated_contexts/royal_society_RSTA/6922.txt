Owing to the fact that the spread of the wave function for the X-ray levels is small
compared with the lattice constant, the determination of /(£) is largely an atomic
problem, as was pointed out by Jones, Mott and Skinner (1934). The simplest treat-
ment is to expand the wave function y of an electronic level of the lattice in a series
of functions ¥,, yp, Yas ---» having the symmetry of s, p, d, ... atomic wave functions in
the neighbourhood of the nuclei. Thus we write

¥=A,¥,+A,v,+AYat seep

where | A, ?-- 4, P+ | 4g |? 2 = 1.
