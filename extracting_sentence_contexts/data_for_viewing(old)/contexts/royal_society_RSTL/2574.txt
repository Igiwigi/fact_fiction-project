ceases, and therefore cannot produce an equal effect in generating a current of elec-
tricity by induction (34. 37.).

1101. As an electric current acts by induction with equal energy at the moment
of its commencement as at the moment of its cessation (10. 26.), but in a contrary
direction, the reference of the effects under examination to an inductive action, would
lead to the conclusion that corresponding effects of an opposite nature must occur
in a long wire, a helix, or an electro-magnet, every time that contact is made with the
electromotor. These effects will tend to establish a resistance for the first moment
in the long conductor, producing a result equivalent to the reyerse of a shock or a
spark. Now it is very difficult to devise means fit for the recognition of such nega-
tive results ; but as it is probable that some positive effect is produced at the time,
if we knew what to expect, I think the few facts bearing upon this subject with which
I am acquainted are worth recording.

1102. The electro-magnet was arranged with an electrolyzing apparatus at a, as
before described (1084.), except that the intensity of the chemical action at the elec-
tromotor was increased until the electric current was just able to produce the feeblest
s8igns of decomposition whilst contact was continued at G and E (1079.) ; (the iodine
of course appearing against the end of the cross wire P;) the wire N was also sepa-
rated from A at r, 80 that contact there could be made or broken at pleasure. Under
these circumstances the following set of actions was repeated sevyeral times : contact
was broken at r, then broken at G, next made at r, and lastly renewed at G; thus
any current from N to P due to breaking of contact was avoided, but any additional
force to the current from P to N due to making contact could be observed. In this
