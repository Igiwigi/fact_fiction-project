strong contraction, and therefore the result on the tracing is a light depression in
the otherwise even curve of ascent. Lest any doubt should arise from the smallness
of the curves representing the weak contractions that the former are in some way
accidental, T may draw attention to the fact that the period of latent stimulation is the
game in the case of all the curves. To render this apparent I have placed marks
below the smaller curves, which show in- each case the exact point where the depressing
effect, of these smaller curves on the ascending sweeps of the larger curves first become
apparent, 7.e., the point at which the feeble contraction begins. Now, what I wish to
be gathered from the whole tracing is this : If the strength of the induction shocks
had been much greater than it was, «ll the contractions would have become strong
contractions, and tetanus would have been the result.
