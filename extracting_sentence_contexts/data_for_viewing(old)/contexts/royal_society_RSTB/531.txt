the Graminew and the Leguminosz, under the influence of mineral manure without
nitrogen, is not absolutely conclusive evidence that the Leguminosze had acquired
nitrogen from some other source than the soil; for there can be little doubt that
Leguminosz do utilise nitrogen existing in the soil in a condition in which it is not
available to the Graminewe. The results obtained in the washed sand, must, however,
be admitted to have much greater significance.

As to the explanation of the results, WoLrr is disposed to attribute the gains of
nitrogen to the absorption of combined nitrogen from the air by the soils, and to the
fixation of free nitrogen within the soil under the influence of porous and alkaline
bodies, as supposed by Coiiz and Franx, rather than to the fixation of free nitrogen
either under the influence of micro-organisms, or directly by the plants themselves.
In fact, neither were the conditions of his experiment with the clover in burnt soil,
nor those of his later experiments in washed sand, such as to favour the supposition
of the intervention of micro-organisms. On the other hand, he considers they were
favourable for the absorption of combined nitrogen from the air, and for the supposed
fixation of free nitrogen within the soil under the influence of porous and alkaline
bodies. At the same time, he admits that it is not easy to explain why Graminez do
not, equally with the Leguminose, benefit by such absorption, and by such fixation.

For our part we believe that a careful consideration of all that is involved in this
undoubted fact, points to the exclusion of the supposition that the gain is either by
the absorption of ammonia from the air, or by the fixation of free nitrogen within the
