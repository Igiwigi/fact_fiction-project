The most characteristic of all the methods of breaking up of the Burmese rubies by
hydration and chemical action is that exhibited when the rhombohedral faces of the
crystals are attacked along the twinning planes that become solution-planes. Fig. 19. In the specimen figured above (fig. 19), which is enlarged 5 diameters, a piece of the
Mogok limestone, showing both cleavage and twinning planes, is seen having embedded

* [It might, of course, be argued that the peculiar forms of these corundums and spinels are due to
irregularities in the growth of the crystals, as in the Babel quartz and certain varieties of fluor and
many other minerals, But that, in the case of the corundums and spinels of Burma, the appearances
presented are actually due to corrosion seems to be proved by the fact that in so many instances the
products of alteration can be seen still surrounding the unaltered gems.—October 7, 1895. |

in it a fine ruby of excellent colour. The rhombohedral faces of the erystal are found
to exhibit the characteristic step-like surfaces, and upon these white patches of
diaspore can still be seen. This mass of limestone exhibits several pseudomorphs after
smaller rubies, and some grains of graphite and pyrrhotite, all enclosed in the calcite,

Break up along their rhombohedral planes, during hydration, and the disintegration of
Zhe diamond during its oxidation (combustion), Mr, J.
