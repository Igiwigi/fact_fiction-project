To begin with there are three specimens whose final orientation,
in the region of the reversed-piece, is uncertain. They had undergone type III operations;
and the posterior region of the trunk is of uniformly poor differentiation, being devoid of
somitic mesoderm. This may conceivably be due to the fact that presumptive side-plate

had replaced presumptive somite, while the presumptive somite had been transferred too
far posteriorly to differentiate at the time of fixation. Eight further specimens show a tendency to reversed development. In all of these a
large piece of the primitive streak was reversed.
