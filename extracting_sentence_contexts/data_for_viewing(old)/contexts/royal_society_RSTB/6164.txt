both are adapted to the reception of vibratory impulses, but the cochlea is especially
attuned to their accurate analysis. Even fishes with no cochlea can respond to
musical notes of low frequency, as Kaprers (1921) has shown, and this author has
well said that the vestibular apparatus represents the protopathic side of vibratory
reception, the cochlear the epicritic. Such a permeation of a lower system by a
higher is no novelty in cerebral evolution. The classical analogy is the invasion of
the dorsal part of the hippocampal commissure by the corpus callosum, as ELLIoT
SmirH (1897) demonstrated long ago ; and Darr (1925) has shown that others can

be found in the forebrain, thalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. It is, in fact,
another example of his “‘ infiltration theory.”

Tue Pons

The pons in both Monotremes is peculiar in its wholly retro-trigeminal
development. In Echidna it is a plump body, fig. 1, considerably larger than
the corresponding organ in Ornithorhynchus. Anteriorly it projects forwards in
the mid-line between the two trigeminal nerves as the rostrum of Extior SmirH
(1895). This covers the caudal pole of the ganglion interpedunculare. The
posterior border extends across the medulla oblongata with a slight posterior
convexity. In the middle line is a shallow raphe. The sixth, seventh, and eighth
nerves are attached to the medulla oblongata at the posterior border of the pons.
