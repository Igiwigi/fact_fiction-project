water, I found that the chloride was reduced, just as it might be by zinc, and oxygen
evolved; and the same takes place with the iodide, bromide, cyanide, nitrate and oxide
of silver and with other metallic combinations. Water alone, as is well known, de-
composes the peroxide of potassium ; this body therefore was in a similar unstable
state to that supposed in the peroxide of hydrogen ; but on extending my experiments
to the peroxide of barium itself, I found that all the reductions which could be made
with the peroxide of hydrogen, took place with this body also with the greatest faci-
lity. Finely-divided platinum, silver or carbon, decompose it, but far less rapidly
than those substances which are themselves also decomposed. I will not here discuss
the general chemical reactions of this peroxide, but defer their consideration until I
can treat with advantage, in a more exact manner, of the general theory of this action.

The facts I have just mentioned gave a direction to my experiments, and instead
of the peroxide of hydrogen, the preparation and preservation of which involved
many difficulties, and with which it was inconvenient to work, I determined to use,
in the experiments I proposed, the peroxide of barium itself.

AT THE MOMENT OF CHEMICAL CHANGE. mil

Before the stndy of these decompositions was possible, it was necessary to have
some ready and accurate method of determining the amount of oxygen in the various
preparations of the peroxide, which could never be obtained absolutely pure and cor-
