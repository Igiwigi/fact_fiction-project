values estimated using these commonly used methods.

Also notable from the data is a substantial variation in zero-plane displacement, d, for the
different surfaces. Table 1 shows the different values of yo and d for the various rough surfaces
examined in this study, while the reader is referred to [10] for further details on the evaluation
of the aerodynamic parameters. It must be noted, when consulting table 1, that the height of the
roughness is fixed for all surfaces at H = 11.4 mm (which includes the connecting pins on the top
of the Lego bricks).

(b) Wind resource availability

The differences in yo and d for different surface morphologies have ramifications for estimating
the wind power output. The fact that yo changes dramatically with the local terrain means that the
shape of the velocity profile also changes, which affects the equivalent wind velocity experienced
by a wind turbine. This is defined as [31]

where N is the number of discretized levels within the rotor layer, Uj and A; are the wind speed
and fractional area for the ith level, respectively, and A is the total area of the rotor disc. Each
fractional area is assumed to be the sector of the rotor disc circle bounded by the midpoints
between the levels above and below the ith level, as shown in figure 4a. The magnitude of the
differences in Ueg that would be experienced by a typical turbine placed at different points in
