Mr. Gass10T, in a paper published in the year 1844+, has shown that the static
effects, or effects of tension, produced by a yoltaic battery, are in»some direct ratio
with the chemical energies of the substances of which the battery is composed ; in
other words, that in a voltaic series, whatever increases the decomposing power of
the battery when the terminals are united by an electrolyte, also increases the effects

. of tension produced by it, when its terminals are separated by a dielectric. In none of the above papers, and in no researches on electricity of which I am
aware, is there any experimental evidence that the polarization of the dielectric is
or may be chemical in its nature, that, assuming a dielectric to consist of two snb-
stances having antagonist chemical relations, as for instance, oxygen and hydrogen,
the particles of the oxygen would be determined in one direction, and those of the
hydrogen in the other; the only experimental result bearing on this point with
which I am acquainted, is the curious fact which was observed by Mr. Gass1ov and

some other electricians who experimented with him in the year 1838, viz. that when
two wires forming the terminals of a powerful battery were placed across each other,
and the voltaic are taken between them, the extremity of the wire proceeding from
the positive end of the battery was rendered incandescent, while the negative wire
remained comparatively cool; it was at that time believed that there was some effect
exhibited here ertra the voltaic circuit.
