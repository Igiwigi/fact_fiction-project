held a like opinion (/0e. cit. 1, 1828). It seems highly probable that this is to be explained
by the fact that the nerve-ganglia of this Planarian, and probably of all others where
such exist, lie within a vascular sinus, a part of the primitive yascular system, and in
continuation with it, the sinus giving off branches in which the nerve-branches lie. I
cannot agree with KepersTery in 8upposing that BLaxcnar's injection of the sinus
round the ganglia of Leptopland and its branches resulted from unskilful manipulation,
and does not represent the true state of the case (KErRsTEIN, loc. cit.p. 21). I had
only one spirit-specimen of Leptoplana available for examination; but/in this the ganglia
were $een on section to be surrounded by a space occupied by loose spongy tissue, very
little stained by carmine and exactly resembling that seen in the vessels of Pipalinm,
and the nerves occupied broad tracts of similar appearance; and on a vertical transverse
section being made of the body, the two canals filled with spongy tissue were cut across,
exactly resembling those of Bothriocephalus in structure, and coinciding in position with
the large pair of longitudinal body-nerves.
