314 MR. E. B. POULTON ON THE COLOUR-RELATION BETWEEN EXPOSED

surroundings. Furthermore, it will be shown that the colour-relation is due to larval
susceptibility during very many hours before pupation, so that, unless special precau-
tions are taken, the larvee may be disturbed or removed from one surface to another in
feeding, observing, &c., and the results are likely to be highly irregular, for the boxes
would always contain one colour which acts powerfully upon these two species, i.e.,
the green leaves of the food-plant.

Professor Mrtpona, in a paper communicated to the Zoological Society (“On a
certain Class of Cases of variable Protective Colouring in Insects,” ‘ Zool. Soc. Proc.,’
1873, p. 153) confirms Mr. T. W. Woop’s observations on the pupz of the Pieride,
for he states (p. 156), “I have observed a similar fact with respect to the pups of
Synchloé (Pieris) brassice and S. rape, specimens from a black fence being generally
darker than those found on walls.” Professor MELDoLA informs me that this con-
clusion was obtained from the comparison of large numbers of individuals.

The next observation of the correspondence between the colours of variable pups
and that of their surroundings is found in a paper by Mrs. M. E. BarBer, communi-
cated by Mr. Darwin to the Entomological Society of London (‘ Entom. Soc. Trans.,’
1874, p. 519). Mrs. Barser had experimented with the pupze of Papilio nireus,
common in most parts of the Cape Colony. The larva itself in this species has also
the power of colour adaptation to its surroundings, for Mrs. BARBER states that it
is dark-green when found feeding upon orange trees, and lighter green upon Vepris
lanceolatu. Tn the natural state the pupal colours are always similar to those of the
