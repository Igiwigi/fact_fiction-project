The mathematical modelling of waves in multi-
scale media is so incredibly fascinating and attractive—
no wonder that many researchers and_ industrial
scientists publish on this topic. Although some of
Author for correspondence: the problems may appear to be classical and well
studied, detailed mathematical analysis often brings new
results. The Helmholtz oscillator formulation, which is
widely regarded as a textbook problem, is in fact so
rich that an advanced asymptotic analysis will reveal
novel features in the structure of the scattered fields
for special classes of scatterers and incident waves.
