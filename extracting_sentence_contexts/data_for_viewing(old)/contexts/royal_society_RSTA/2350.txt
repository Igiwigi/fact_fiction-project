its effectiveness for parameter identification on
historic masonry structures. This study combines
a Bayesian framework with probabilistic structural
analyses: starting from the Bayesian finite element
model updating by using experimental data it
provides the definition of robust seismic fragility
curves for non-isolated masonry towers. A
comparison between this method and the standard
deterministic approach illustrates its benefits.
