circuit including the dorsal and possibly also the ventral nerve centres. The point will be apparent if
one remembers that the entire area in front of the postoral ciliated band (excepting only sucker and
stalk), together with the band itself and the various larval ciliated processes, is brought at metamorphosis
to the oral surface of the starfish within an area enclosed by the ring canal of the hydrocele. If
a circumoral nerve ring existed in the larva it could therefore be transferred to the adult as easily as the
larval cesophagus. However, as far as I have yet made out, the formation of the adult nerve ring in
A, rubens is independent of pre-existing specialised nerve centres or tracts. This independence must be
absolute in Bip. asterigera. At the same time we see in the Solaster larva (29, p. 47) a case where the
dorsal nerve centre, though imperfectly represented, is carried at metamorphosis into the area where the
nerve ring is developing, while in the Echinid larva, as MACBRIDE has shown (57), there is a definite nerve
centre dorsal to the mouth entrance, though it takes no part in the formation of the adult nervous system.
Parallel facts are to be found in the case of other Echinoderms, and if we take Balanoglossus into account
we shall probably be justified in concluding (1) that the bilateral ancestor had a circumoral nerve ring
or commissure with dorsal and ventral nerve centres; (2) that the various types of echinoderm larve
have developed only what they actually required in the way of a nervous system, and that the adult
circumoral nerve ring is now in some cases entirely, and in others almost entirely, an independent
formation ; (3) the phylogenetic derivation of this ring from the circumoral nervous circuit of the
ancestor is, in the absence of contrary evidence, a reasonable possibility. As regards the crinoids, if it
be correct (p. 255) to say that the stalk represents phylogenetically a preoral lobe which has become
twisted towards the right instead of towards the left side, we may perhaps find in the neuro-muscular
fibres of the anterior part of the ancestral larva a starting point for the remarkable development of the
apical entoneural nervous system which is characteristic of this class.

We must be careful to note that in A. rubens, at metamorphosis, the insertion of
