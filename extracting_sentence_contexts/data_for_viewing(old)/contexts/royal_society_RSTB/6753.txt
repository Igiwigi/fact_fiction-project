As Dr Leakey has pointed out, similar types of primitive hand axe have been known
to occur even with Acheulean cultures, and they are therefore not absolute evidence of
the Chellean age of these deposits. Nevertheless, the fact that such primitive types
were found, while more advanced ones were completely absent, is in itself some
evidence that they are of early age, for wherever Acheulian implements occurred they
did so in considerable quantity. It should also be remarked that deposits about 130 ft.
above the Kabua waterhole gravels bore implements of Acheulian stage 3 upon their
surface. Furthermore, no fauna of any kind was discovered in any of the deposits
which yielded Chellean implements, while, on the other hand, those which contained
Acheulian artifacts were usually highly fossiliferous. The appearance of this fauna,
which is of nilotic type, in beds with Acheulian implements dates the connexion of the
lake basin with the Nile fairly accurately. The importance of those deposits which are
unfossiliferous except for a few Chellean implements, lies in the fact that it is just such
an absence of fossils that would be expected in deposits laid down between the time
of the extinction of the Kaiso fauna and the arrival of the Nile fauna at the height of
the following lake maximum.

Towards the end of the Chellean the lake level again began to fall, though to what
extent is uncertain. The discovery of very late Chellean or very early Acheulian imple-
ments in beds about 100 ft. above the present shoreline shows that the lake must have
dropped to approximately that level.

That it again rose to another maximum in Acheulian times is shown by the large
number of Acheulian implements which are found washing out from deposits over-
lying those of the Chellean. The exact altitude to which this Acheulian lake attained
