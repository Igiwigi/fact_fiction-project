The uniformly small size of the pebbles, in spite of their great hardness, points, however,
to a distant origin and to their being river borne. It is more logical to assume that they
first reached the sea in Lower Calcareous Grit times, where all the evidence points to
river influence and in which they lie side by side with fruits of Carpolithes and drifted
logs, than to transfer the event to the Oxford Clay period, in which no such evidence
exists. The conclusion, then, to which the facts seem to point is that the sands of the Lower
Calcareous Grit, together with the small quartz and lydite pebbles, were brought by a
river from the south-east, which entered the sea somewhere south-east of Marcham. They were then distributed along the coast as submarine sandbanks by a long-shore
current, incorporating the remains of marine animals and gradually dropping their load
of heavier materials. IV.â€”Tue Berksxtre Oouire Pertop.*
