solution it gave a certain reading and that another solution containing, say, 30 per cent.
of CO-hemoglobin, gave a reading 12 divisions away from the oxyhzemoglobin reading,
then a 30 per cent. COHb solution would always give a reading 12 divisions removed
from the oxyhzemoglobin solution, and so for other strengths. Yet when we found an
apparently great change in our blood volumes we began to wonder whether we could
trust the instrument so far.

It is fair to the Hartridge technique to say that since returning from Peru we have
taken the instrument to bits at least three times, and in addition, by minor manipula-
tions, have shifted the zero (oxyhemoglobin) reading to different parts of the scale,
but we have always found our original assumption justified. Three calibration curves
are given in fig, 30. The fact that the framework of the instrument was made of
