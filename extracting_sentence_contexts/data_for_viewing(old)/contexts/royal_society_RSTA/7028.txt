do not provide any observable spectra. In the case of L,,-spectra of metals, the
intensity in the band drops suddenly from its maximum value; in the case of K-spectra,
the intensity falls more or less gradually and then drops suddenly at the emission
edge. As is shown in figure 4 the breadth of the emission edge depends on the tem-
perature; at liquid-air temperature it is less than about ;'5 eV, but rises at room
temperature to about 7 eV.

In the case of non-metals, there is a characteristic difference. The sharp fall in
intensity occurs, though in the case of sulphur in several stages. This large fall in
intensity, however, always occupies an energy range of at least 1 eV; it isnot sufficiently
sharp to show the (L,—L,) doubling. Also, on the short wave-length side of this
‘false’ emission edge, other comparatively sharp features of the band are to be found.
These are weak, but they are in fact sharper than the false edge already mentioned.
Thus, in the case of Si, P and S a drop in intensity occurs sufficiently quickly to show
the (L,—Z,) separation with certainty. This characteristic, which the present work is
the first to establish, will be designated as the main ‘band end’; further band ends,
too weak to show (L,—L,) doubling seem always to appear at even shorter wave-
lengths. The band ends are by no means as sharp as the metal edges; they never
attain a breadth less than about } eV. Nor can this peculiarity be ascribed to tem-
perature. It is true that when an insulator is used as anticathode, the effective tem-
perature is somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, in the cases of P and S, ifthe temperature
had risen up to room temperature, a considerable evaporation of the material would
have taken place. Further, in the cases of B and Si, the conductivity is certainly good
enough to prevent any appreciable rise in temperature due to the electron bombard-
ment in the X-ray tube, and, in the case of Si, experiments at temperatures between
