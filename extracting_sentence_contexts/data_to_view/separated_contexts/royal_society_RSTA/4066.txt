There was
surfusion at this second freezing point, and therefore it is certain that a new solid
now began to form in the crucible. It was noticed that the alloy with 22Â°3 atoms of
aluminium solidified at an extremely constant temperature. This is in harmony with
the fact that we are now close to the eutectic angle. If we pass from C towards D by adding aluminium, the upper freezing point is at
first very transient, while the lower one, belonging to the same alloy, is a very
steady temperature. But as we approach D, near 28 atoms, the reverse is true.
