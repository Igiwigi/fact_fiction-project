TUBERCULAR SWELLINGS ON THE ROOTS OF VICIA FABA. 555

tubercles occur on water-cultures, and I have now shown that most satisfactory
results can be obtained by means of water-cultures. Tscurrct also states that they
are commoner on the roots of plants growing in poor soil (as regards nitrogen) than
on those in rich humus-soils, a statement I fail to confirm. Darkness, drought, and
other disturbing influences of the kind hinder the proper development of the
tubercles ; and the rule is that the tubercles flourish in proportion to the thriving
of the plant.

It is obvious, on a little reflection, that there would be nothing in these facts
which contradicts the explanation I have given. Since the gemmules stimulate the
protoplasm of the cells to greater activity—as indicated by the increased supplies of
starch and the hypertrophied growth—it is clear that the needs for the increased
activity will be satisfied only in proportion to the ability of the host-plant to furnish
supplies : darkness would cut off the supplies of carbo-hydrates, and drought those
of water and minerals, and thence the parasite and protoplasm in the tubercles suffer.
This can be directly shown in water-cultures, as well as in the case of plants growing
in the open. As regards the generalisation that the tubercles are commoner in soils
which are poor in nitrogenous substances, this might be because there is more oxygen
supplied to the very large active root-systems in such soils ; a view, moreover, which
is in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt to be more
abundant and larger on those parts of the roots which are nearer the surface of the
