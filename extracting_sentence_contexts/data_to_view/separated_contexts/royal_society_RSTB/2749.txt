Rogers used a current with the secondary coil at 25 millims. Racorzi* has
stated that in order to obtain evidence of peripheral nerve-end paralysis in cobraism,
one must avoid the administration both of large rapidly fatal doses and of too small
doses. In fact, there must be a moderately large dose in circulation, and it must be
allowed a sufficient time to act. One of us has recently shown that the phrenic
nerve-ends remain fully sensitive (@) in animals which have been poisoned by large
intravenous doses of Cobra venom, and (b) in those which have been killed by
subcutaneous doses not greatly exceeding the minimum lethal. It was at the same
time shown that the phrenic nerve-ends can be paralysed by giving lethal doses and
then maintaining life by means of artificial respiration.
