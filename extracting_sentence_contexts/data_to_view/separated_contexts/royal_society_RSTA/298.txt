The circadian and homeostatic processes were
formalized phenomenologically in the two-process model of sleep regulation
51,52]. According to this model, a homeostatic process (process S; relaxation
oscillator) and a circadian process (process C) interact to generate sleep-awake
patterns (on a time scale of hours to days in humans and minutes in rodents). In recent years, more and more facts about the underlying neurophysiological
mechanisms have been uncovered by experimental work [53]. Based on these
findings, several attempts have been made to develop mathematical models
of the neural dynamics underlying sleep regulation. There the activity of the
specific neural populations involved in sleep regulation is modelled by coupled
nonlinear ordinary differential equations that can produce limit cycles, show
1ysteresis effects and undergo bifurcations.
