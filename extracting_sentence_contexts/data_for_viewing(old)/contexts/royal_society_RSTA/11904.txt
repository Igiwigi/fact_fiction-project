In the absence of more exact knowledge of the wave-lengths of the radiations
producing the rings, it is not yet possible to determine if they are represented by
dark lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum, but it can already be stated that, if present
at all, they are among the feeble lines.

Comparison with Prominence Spectrum.

A point of some importance is the apparent absence of the 1474 K ring from the
spectra of the chromosphere and prominences. A. similar absence of 1474 K from
the prominence spectrum was noted by Respreut in the eclipse of 1871. I am not
aware of any observation in which the form of a prominence has been observed in
1474 light. All these facts seem to indicate that when the 1474 is observed at the
sunâ€™s limb without an eclipse, the spectrum of the corona itself is under examination,
under the same conditions as those recorded in the eclipse photographs.

Of the other coronal rings photographed in 1893, those at wave lengths 4217 and
4280 are approximately coincident with feeble prominence radiations, but since the
other coronal rings are not represented in the prominences, the coincidences may be
regarded as accidental.

Although H and K are by far the most intense of the radiations of the prominences,
on no occasion have they been photographed as rings in the spectrum of the corona
with the prismatic cameras. They have, however, been occasionally recorded as
