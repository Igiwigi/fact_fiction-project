As an example, I may cite the pit at Thorington Hall,
Wherstead, which I visited, in company with Mr. Morr, in May last. The flints
(both ordinary specimens and implements) found in the bone-bed there have a
whitish, cream-coloured surface. The evidence which enables an expert in the
flints of various beds and horizons, which he is continually handling, to distinguish the
exact locality and horizon from which each comes, is not easy to describe in words,
It is not, in fact, possible to enable a reader to recognise such characters by
description ; specimens must be seen and compared. Mr. Morr has this experience
and capacity, so also have the members of the Committee of the East Anglian
Prehistoric Society who drew up the report accepting Mr. Morr’s conclusions. To
some extent, I have this knowledge myself, and I do not hesitate to associate
certain of Mr. Morr’s worked flints with the unworked flints occurring in the
bone-bed at the localities of Bolton and Laughlin’s pit, and at the Thorington Hall
pit, where they were obtained by workmen employed to dig for them in the
basement bed of the Red Crag.
