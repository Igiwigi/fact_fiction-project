ment, only about 10!°bitss~’ are deposited in the retina.
Because of a limited number of axons in the optic nerves
(approx. 1 million axons in each) only 10° bits s~' leave the
retina and only 10* make it to layer IV of V1. These data clearly
leave the impression that visual cortex receives a very com-
pressed representation of the world, a subject of more than
passing interest to those interested in the processing of visual
information [26]. Parenthetically, it should be noted that esti-
mates of the bandwidth of conscious awareness itself
(i.e. what we ‘see’) are in the range of 100 bits s | or less [25].

Reinforcing this impression of the brain’s ‘isolation’ is the
fact that the number of synapses in the lateral geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus and in layer IV of primary visual
cortex devoted to incoming visual information is less than
10% of the total number of synapses in both locations [27].
Various proposals have been made concerning the interpret-
ation of these anatomical data [28,29] but the fact remains
that the brain must interpret, respond to and even predict
environmental demands from seemingly impoverished
data. An explanation for its success in doing so must lie in
significant measure with intrinsic brain processes that link
representations residing broadly within brain systems to
incoming sensory information [30].
