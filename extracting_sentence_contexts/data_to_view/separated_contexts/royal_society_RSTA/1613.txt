Theorem 4.7. Suppose that condition (A) is satisfied and that A(A) < }. Then for every i€ J, uj isa
point of global bifurcation in R x Ha for the equation f(A, u) =0 and, in fact, C; has at least one of the
following properties.

(a) C; 0 [R x {0}] = {(4i,0)} and sup p(C;) = oe.
(b) C0 [8 x (0}] AB where Yj =[B\{uj}] UZ, 00). Remark 4.8. By theorems 3.3 and 3.9 of [30], case (b) does not occur for C, and C; = {(A, uy):
2 > A(A)} where 1 +> u,, is continuous from [A(A), co) into Ha with uy(4) =0 and u,(x) > 0 for
x €[0,1) for all A > A(A).
