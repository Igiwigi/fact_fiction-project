boreal forests and tundra. Figure 2b shows the change in M12 from 2000 to 2050 for a range of
emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5; IPCC [102]). For the more optimistic scenario (RCP4.5) the
changes in biome mean M12 are relatively small (â€”3.6 to +2.7 ppb), and biome mean M12 values
decline by 2050 in the temperate and boreal biomes, which had the highest M12 values in 2000,
while mean M12 values for tropical, subtropical and montane biomes tend to increase. For the
more pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5) increases of over 10 ppb in M12 were found in forests and
grasslands, and in the region covering part of India, the Himalayas and western China. These are
all regions identified as having high N deposition by 2030 [103], which highlights the need for
improved understanding of O3-N interactions in unmanaged systems [24].

Importantly, these risk assessments conducted for agriculture, forests and grasslands suggest
that policies represented by the more optimistic scenarios do not always lead to a reduction in the
spatial extent of O3 risk. In fact, for some regions, particularly in Asia, the extent and magnitude
of risks are likely to increase in the future [24,93]. Coupled with these increases in O3 risk are
changes in other stress factors such as enhanced N deposition [103], climate change and elevated
COz [102], which modelling suggests can have substantial impacts on modifying the sensitivity
of vegetation to O3 damage.

5. Future ozone trends and implications for vegetation

There are essentially two options available to reduce the damage to vegetation resulting from
elevated O3, the first is to reduce the concentrations of O3 pollution in the atmosphere via


mitigation, i.e. a reduction in O3 precursor emissions, and the second is to develop adaptation
