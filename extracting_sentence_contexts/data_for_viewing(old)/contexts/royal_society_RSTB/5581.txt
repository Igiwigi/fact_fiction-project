muscle (BiscHorr, 1842, 6; GmcEnBAuR, 1892; Eprn, 1915; Grosser, 1918;
Corner, 1923; ANDERSEN, 1927). Which of these opinions is correct it is difficult to
state.

Tt has been shown already in discussing the migration of sperms that the uterine
tube of the rabbit is completely ciliated and that all cilia beat toward the uterus. It
is also well established that the walls of the tube are provided with muscles and are
actively mobile (GUTHMANN, 1922; SECKINGER, 1923, 1924; SecKINGER and CorNER.
1923; Seckincer and Snyper, 1924, 1926), showing especially segmentation (Kox,
1925, a, 1925, b; von Mixuticz-RapEcKI, 1926) and, notwithstanding the declaration
of von Mrxuticz-RapeckI to the contrary, abundant peristalsis and occasional anti-
peristalsis (Kox, 1925, a, 1925, b, 1926; Wuxstman, 1926, a, 1926, b). Kox (1927, a)
has recently shown good reason to assume a reflex innervation in the tubes. The fact
that in some mammals, such as the mouse and the rat, the tubes are partly devoid of
cilia makes it highly probable, as already pointed out by Soporra (1914), that peristalsis
at least is one effective factor in moving the eggs. But proof of this kind affords no
ground on which to deny the participation of cilia in the process.

Tt has been claimed by a number of workers (KeHrER, 1863 ; Hem, 1893 ; Hormerer,
1893 ; von Mixuticz-RapEckI, 1926) that the ciliary beat of the tube is not sufficiently
strong to move the eggs of the rabbit. It is true that material such as grains of car-
mine and the like, if placed on the ciliated surface of an opened uterine tube, will often
remain motionless where they were placed, even though the subjacent cilia are in full
activity. The mammalian egg and other such objects might be expected to fare in a
similar manner. This is not because these bodies are too heavy, but because they are
