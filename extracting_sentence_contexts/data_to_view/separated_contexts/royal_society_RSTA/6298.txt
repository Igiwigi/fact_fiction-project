These electrons can then transfer into the Fermi level of noble-metal
nanoparticles and return to Vo states, strengthening the CE contribution in the Raman signal. Formation of surface Vo sites under UVC-light irradiation (4 =254nm) was later confirmed via
time-resolved atomic force microscopy [16]. The proposed mechanism based on Vo was also
supported by the fact that PIERS is a transient effect and the enhanced signals decreased within a
range of 30-60 min upon exposure to air, which was attributed to the loss of surface vacancies [17]. The use of PIERS as a sensing technique has been reviewed recently [18]. As it has been pointed
out, different operation procedures have been followed, either ex situ—with irradiation of the
substrate before or after deposition of the target molecule—or in situ, with irradiation during
the Raman analysis.
