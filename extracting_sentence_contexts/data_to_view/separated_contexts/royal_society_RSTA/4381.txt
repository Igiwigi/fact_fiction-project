The standard is black; filled symbols have 3% Mg; unfilled symbols have
6% Mg; blue symbols are calcined at 550째C and washed; red symbols are calcined at 550째C and unwashed; green symbols are
calcined at 800째C. Hence, it is proposed that Mg ions have a poisoning effect on the intrinsic activity of Co metal
sites and the degree of poisoning depends on the concentration of Mg ions close to the Co sites. The decrease in activity with increasing Mg incorporation into Co3O4 appears not to be simply
due to the total amount of Mg present in the sample, exemplified by the fact that AW6 has almost
twice the total amount of Mg as AW2 but approximately 150% of the activity at 210째C. Poisoning by Ca has been observed previously with the reduction in activity being attributed
to electronic effects causing a decrease in surface hydrogen concentrations and increased CO
adsorption and dissociation [22]. Another study investigating the poisoning effect of alkali and
alkaline earth metals in the context of impurity elements in biomass-derived syngas implied that
Mg had a poisoning effect but that it was less than for Ca.
