Ro! Mr. Kiser makes on this occasion the just remark that on this base we ought to obtain probabilities
inferior to the reality, in consequence of the fact that the couples married in the year of the census
unduly enlarge the numerator. He therefore undertakes to correct the figures in an approximate
way. Thus, he obtains the following corrected probabilities: 15-19, 41°3 (instead of 264) ; 20-24,
, 51-9 (43°) ; 25-29, 43° (39°7); 30-34, 36° (349); 35-39, 30° (29°6); 40-44, 18:1 (179); 45-49,
: 33 (32).
