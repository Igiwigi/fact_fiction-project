unfolding consists in grabbing a protein with the probe, pulling from it at constant velocity :8
and measuring the force required to unfold it. Early experiments by the group of Hermann :3
Gaub revealed that certain protein domains, such as the immunoglobulin-like (I) domains of â€˜Ss
titin formed by f sheets, unfolded in an abrupt manner in a reversible processes that was
described with just two states: the native, folded state and the unfolded state [21]. Being a
thermally activated process, unfolding forces depended on the pulling rate, actually on the
rate of force increase or loading rate (figure 5). The Bell-Evans model allows us to model this
process and characterize the energy barrier in terms of a distance to the transition state (x,) and
