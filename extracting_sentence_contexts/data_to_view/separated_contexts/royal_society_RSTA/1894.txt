where Y% is the potential at the bottom boundary and Ap is the Debye length. Figure 6 shows that the numerical results of the concentration and potential distributions along
the Y axis are consistent with the analysis. In figure 6b, the potentials at location close to y=
100 Ibu from simulation and analysis different slightly, which due to the fact that in the analytical
solution, it is assumed a boundary at y = +00.

4. Simulation of the simplified reactive plasma flow in a cylinders packed bed

(a) Simulations and results

With all the validated 2D LB model components discussed previously, we developed a numerical
model to study a (simplified) weakly ionized plasma flow in a packed bed reactor. The bed
consist of a regular array of cylinders (which appear to be spheres in 2D) and it is simulated
to study the reactant consumption rate, q, under different control parameters.
