Bto affect it earlier, for, if another finger or toe be excited, the movement is at once
elicited from it, in accordance with the rule of spatial monotony. Among the deep
reflexes a good example of monotony of repetition is contraction of the median part of
the gracilis muscle, which occurs each time one of the two tendons of the tibialis
anticus muscle is nipped above the annular ligament (Cat).

The reflex movements elicitable from the Mammalian spinal cord after cross-
section are often extremely brief—surprisingly so ; in fact, as Fick* has pointed out
in dealing with the dorsal nerves of the Frog, often like simple wotor twitches. The

movements have seemed to me most brief when least vigorous and most limited in
extent, more so in the Monkey in its early condition subsequent to cord-section than
in the Cat and Dog under similar conditions. Stimuli that at first elicit only a
single movement of a single joint later elicit frequently a short sequence of move-
ments about a series of joints; the capacity for developing a sequence is much
