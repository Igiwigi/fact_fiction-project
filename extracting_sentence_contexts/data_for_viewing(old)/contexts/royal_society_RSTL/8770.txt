No other explanation appears to hold good. The conditions were exactly those which
have been described as favourable to acoustic opacity ; the sea was calm, there was no
wind, and an August 8w was $hining with its full power, and, having evaporated the
clouds, must have been raising vapour from the sea.

During the experiment I particularly noticed the echoes. Except the first and only
pistol, none of the reports were attended with echoes or reverberatiom. But in most
cases, though not in all, after calling T could hear the ring of my voice for ten or
eleven seconds; and on one or two occasions when there were boats within half a mile
of us, I could distinctly hear the echoes from them. Without attempting to explain the
reverberation and echoes which have been observed, I will merely call attention to
the fact that in no case have I heard any attending the reports of the rockets, although
they seem to have been invariable with the guns and pistols. This fact suggests that
these echoes are in some way connected with the direction given to the sound. They
are caused by the voice, trumpets, and the siren, all of which give direction to the
sound ; but I am not aware that they have ever been observed in the case of a sound
which has no direction of greatest intensity.

Ara6o's Zrperiments.

These observations in Tynn Deeps were the last T made in 1874. In the spring of
this year my attention was called to a phenomenon recorded by ARaGo, which was
noticed during the celebrated experiments on the velocity of sound made by HUMBOLDT,
Ara6o, Proxy, Gavy-Lus84C, and others, on the nights of the 21st and 22nd of June,
