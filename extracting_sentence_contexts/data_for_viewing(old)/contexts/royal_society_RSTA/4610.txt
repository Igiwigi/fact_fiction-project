shows the maximum wave height as a function of distance averaged along concentric circles
around the point of impact. The wave attenuates quickly with an attenuation factor q=1.2,
resulting in maximum wave heights along the coast similar to the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku
tsunamis. For comparison of the results, we have included data from other studies rescaled to
the Eltanin event in the figure. There appears to be an overall agreement that waves attenuate
in the far field proportional to r~! to r~!, which is also in accordance with empirical estimates
from Glasstone & Dolan [27]. The main difference in the predicted wave amplitudes results from


deviations between the assumptions on the initial wave heights. While Weiss et al. [48] predict
wave heights of the order of a couple of hundred metres in the near field, Shuvalov & Gresonde
[39] determined wave heights of up to 1000 m close to the point of impact. These large differences
most likely result from the fact that waves close to the point of impact are highly nonlinear, break
and form bores, which makes it difficult to quantify the process. Such turbulent behaviour cannot
be resolved sufficiently by existing hydrocode simulations and more appropriate modelling tools
are required to quantify wave behaviour near to intermediate distance (10-100 km) from the point
of impact.

5. Conclusion

Meteorite impacts pose a natural threat to society. If such an event occurs in a marine : >
environment, the generation of tsunami waves would enhance the consequences by enlarging =
the affected area in comparison with similar size impacts on land. The question of whether the :s
magnitude of impact-generated tsunami waves exceeds the devastation due to any other natural LS
catastrophy such that traces of palaeo-events could be recognized in the geological record remains : <
