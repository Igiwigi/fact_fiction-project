Introduction.

Is the © Concluding Remarks” appended to Part II. of my © Researches on the Fora-
minifera ” (Philosophical Transactions for 1856, p. 565), I pointed out that the System
of Classification of that group which had been erected by M. D'OrB16Gxy on the exclu-
8ive basis of plan of growth, was inconsistent with the facts disclosed by a careful study
of the organization of the five typical Genera described in my first and second Memoirs :
since it had the effect of bringing together Genera whose strongly marked physiological
MUifferences required that they should be separated by the widest possible interval ; whilst
it ranked under different Orders generic types which exhibit the closest physiological
relationship. And I then laid it down as a fundamental principle, © that physiological
conformity in the condition of each individual segment, as indicated by the structure of
its shelly investment, is a character of primary importance ; whilst the plan of growth,
that is, the mode of increase in the number of chambers, is a character of subordinate
importance.” And in the © Concluding Summary ” appended to Part IV. (Philosophical
Transactions, 1860, p. 569), I further expanded this doctrine, by showing that all the
{ypes which I had described might be ranged in two parallel Series: one of them cha-
racterized by that peculiar texture of the Shell which had been appropriately designated
