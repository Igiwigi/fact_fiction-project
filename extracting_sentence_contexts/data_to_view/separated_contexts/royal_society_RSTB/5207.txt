Conversely the mucous
membranes of the mouth and pharynx and the skin were but little coloured by an
arterial injection, though deeply tinted by the injection mass within the “ fine vessels.’ Cleared specimens show even more definitely that whereas the blood vessels form rich
capillary plexuses within the skeletal muscles, the “ fine ’’ vessels do not, but only pass
through them here and there, as relatively large trunks, to form capillary plexuses else-
where, particularly in the connective tissues underlying exposed surfaces such as the
skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth and pharynx. The interest of this difference in distribution lies in the fact that a want of penetration
into the skeletal muscles is one of the characteristics of the lymphatic system of verte-
brates in general. * This suggests a relationship between the “ fine ” vessels and the
lymphatics, which is borne out (as detailed below) by other and more cogent considera-

tions.
