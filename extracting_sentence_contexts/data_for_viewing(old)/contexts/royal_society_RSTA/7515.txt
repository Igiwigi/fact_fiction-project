large number of occasions when the gradient was very small. It was found, in this
range of distance, that the gradient was positive for 404 min. with an average value of
+570 V/m. and negative for 190 min. with an average value of —880 V/m.; the time
average value, including periods of both signs, was +110 V/m. The results of these
computations are given in Table VI, and the mean value of the gradient is plotted
against distance in fig. 2. It will be noted that, at all distances, negative gradients
tend to be of greater magnitude than positive gradients; this fact, indeed, makes the
average value of the gradient, at distances between 10 and 15 km., negative although
periods of positive gradient are more frequent.
