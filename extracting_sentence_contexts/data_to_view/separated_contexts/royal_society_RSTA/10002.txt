Its object was to enable a constant current to be maintained through
the calorimeter, independent of variations in the earth’s magnetic field. Latimer CLaRK,{i in determining the E.M.F. of his standard cell in 1872, used a bifilar electro-
dynamometer with circular fixed and moving coils, each arranged in the Helmholtz fashion. The fixed
coils were of large size relative to the suspended ones, a fact which considerably simplified the calculation
of the torque per unit current. ‘The instrument had been constructed for the Electrical Standards
