MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZX. 699

tried the effects of stimulating the conyex, or external, surface of Sarsia, in consequence
of its having been suggested to me that, as this is the surface which is naturally the
most liable to come in contact with foreign bodies during the natural swimming-
motions of the animal, it is to be expected that this part of the animal should receive
a nerve-supply from the marginal ganglia. But although this is what we might
reasonably expect to be the case, as a matter of fact it is not 80. Even strong
faradaic stimulation applied to any part of the external surface of the nectocalyx fails
to produce the slightest response, provided the current employed is not s0 strong as to
cause escape into the internal surface. That the responses are due to snch an escape
of the current when over-strong currents are used, may be proved by using weaker
currents and progressively pushing the needle-point terminals further and further into
the gelatinous substance of the nectocalyx. According to the strength of the current
employed, @ point will sooner or later be reached at which the escape finds its way to
the internal surface, and therenpon causes the bell to contract.

In these experiments it is desirable to use electrical or chemical stimulation, becausc,
when the animal is suspended in water, it is impossible to stimulate the external surface
of the bell mechanically without causing the whole animal to move slightly through
