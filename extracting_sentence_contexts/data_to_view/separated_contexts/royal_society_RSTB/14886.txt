Most research on other sensory modalities has focused
[81], even if its onset determines for how long V1 itself is on how vision affects auditory processing. Visual effects have
required for visual decision making [41]. In fact, while several been described for the auditory cortex in primates [96,97], fer-
earlier studies suggested that the first tens of milliseconds of rets [98,99], as well as rodents [37,46,100-102]. These influences
V1 sensory-evoked activity were required to enable decision have been generally found to be weaker compared to auditory
making [84,85], this was recently extended to up to 200 ms, or responses in V1 [46,100], suggesting that there is an asymmetry
more precisely until the onset of the late, report-related bump between the two sensory systems. Analogously, asymmetries
in activity [41].
