The one
a mechanical viscosity arising from the molar motion of the fluid, the other a physical
property of the fluid. It is worth while to point out that, although the conditions
under which the first of these, the mechanical viscosity, can exist depend primarily on
the physical viscosity, the actual magnitudes of these viscosities are independent, or
are only connected in a secondary manner. This is shown by a very sbriking but
little noticed fact. When the motion of the fluid is such that the resistance is as the
