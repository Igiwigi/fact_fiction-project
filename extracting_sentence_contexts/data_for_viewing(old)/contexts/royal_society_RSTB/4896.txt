continuous, the deaths are spread over the whole curve of increase, and p, must naturally
be smaller to give the same total of species extinct.

In sections 3, 4, and 5 of the table similar comparisons are made for successively
increased severity of the destruction of species. In section 5, with 100 cataclysms each
killing-out one-third of the then existing species, the total number of species killed-out
would be over 700,000, the free doubling-period would be lowered to 1-3 million years,
and the present rate of production of specific mutations would be raised to 1 in some 12
years. -

But unfortunately, as already stated, there seems no basis at present for estimating
even roughly the total number of extinct species, so as to estimate whereabouts on the
table the truth in fact lies. That line of approach, at present at all events, is not possible.
But another and more hopeful line is afforded by the second column—the chance of a
species surviving. We know that the chance of a species surviving from the origin of
the flowering plants to the present time must be infinitesimally small, for no species
has so survived. On the other hand, we know that a species may survive through very
long periods of geological time. Hence we might reasonably conjecture that py is too
large in sections 2 and 3 of the table, and possibly too small in section 5. The con-
jecture seems to be confirmed by utilising some valuable data given by Mrs. CLEMENT
Rez in Chapter XIV of * Age and Area’ (p. 144) and reproduced below.

Taking, e.g., the lowest figure showing 10 per cent. of survivals from the base of the
Pliocene to the present time—it is founded on a single local deposit only and obviously
too much weight must not be attached to it—can we use it to suggest a value for pr $
