Plate 14, fig. 31, shows a later stage where the first segmentation nucleus is
lready formed. A delicate nuclear wall can be clearly seen, and also remains of
Bho achromatic spindle. A number of larger and smaller granules, presumably of
‘Gucleolar origin, are to be found scattered around the nucleus, although the nuclear
Gall has been already formed. These have been cast out of the fertilized nucleus,
Sut they do not return to the daughter nuclei (¢/ ZIMMERMANN, 30) but disappear in
“Bhe protoplasm.
= The first two segmentation nuclei when newly formed are very small and have the
asual character of young daughter nuclei (fig. 31); but almost immediately they
degin to swell very considerably, For a time this swelling is due mainly to vacuo-
Bation, but later on they take up metaplasmic substance, just as the oosphere nucleus
“Boes during maturation. In fact they pass through exactly similar stages. The

mentation nuclei may reach to one-third the size of the unfertilized female nucleus.
8 The two first segmentation nuclei while lying free in the protoplasm of the egg,

soon begin to divide. Fig. 25 shows this process just beginning. The chromosomes
of both nuclei are already differentiated, but the spindles are not yet formed. The
metaplasm in the form of a lightly-staining granular substance fills the nuclear
cavities. Fig. 26 represents a later stage of one of these nuclei. The chromosomes
are here seen on the spindle. The latter is surrounded by a clear space crossed by
bands of protoplasm.

The division of the first two nuclei seems always to take place simultaneously
