pointed out by W. Krauss,” dissection alone cannot adequately unravel the nerve-
courses even in peripheral nerves. By using, however, the physiological laws of isolated
conduction in nerve-fibres (MiLLER), and of degeneration of nerve-cell processes
(Water), the difficulties of the nerve-plexuses and nerve-inosculations can be com-
pletely set aside. This being done, the nerve-elements in the limb become the best
guides available for the tracing of segmental architecture. That was the view of
Goopsrr, and I share it for the following reasons. The nerve-cells are among the earliest
cells in the body, to cease the exercise of reproductive activity, and especially is this true
of the cells of the spinal ganglia and of the primary motor neurons of the spinal cord.
Neither are these cells in any sense vagrant. Remaining from a very early period
securely anchored in a spot of known metameric orientation, their cell-processes,
i.e., nerve-fibres, radiate out into the rest of the metamere, whose various elements
they have to bring into relationship with themselves as central station. In fact, they
follow up the extension of the metamere, not by the process in virtue of which the
other tissue of the metamere extends—namely, by cell-division, but by individual
growth and increase of the length of the already existing cell-branches. This power
of comparatively unlimited increase in individual size by elongation of cell-processes,
