27. This principle will, if we mistake not; be found to
afford at least a plausible explanation of most, if not all the
phznomena above described, without the necessity of calling
in any additional hypothesis, or new doctrine in| magnetism. For the other principle we shall have occasion to employ,
that magnetic bodies differ exceedingly, both in ssceptibility.
of this quality and in the degree of the pertinacity with which
they retain it (which may be called their retentive power), is
not an hypothesis, but an acknowledged fact. 1t is only in
the mode of its extension to new cases of magnetics that we
can be led into any fallacies. Whether these two qualities
(susceptibility and retentive power) be, or be not mutually
dependent, this is not the place to enquire. Probably they
are not 80, at least directly : and the new facts almost con-
vert this probability into certainty ; at all events, at present
we $hall for greater generality suppose them independent.

observed the following facts, which set the principle stated in the text in a very
clear light.
