Mendeleevâ€™s table after the discovery of the noble gases. Once the noble gases were discovered they were assigned to a ninth group which Mendeleev
designated as group zero (figure 2) [4]. There are some distinct advantages to these short-form tables, most notably the fact that the
group number coincides with the highest oxidation number. As time progressed, the short-form
was gradually abandoned in favour of an 18-column representation [5]. The latter representation
is usually attributed to Deming although his original version (figure 3) [6] was rather different
from the one that is so commonplace today (figure 4).
