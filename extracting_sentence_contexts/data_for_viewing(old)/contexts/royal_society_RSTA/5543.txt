suggested that a complete MF analysis of heartbeat dynamics should incorporate inhomogeneous 1S

point-process models [27,38].

The results show that synchronized changes in brain and heartbeat dynamics occur in the
MF domain for the CPT phase, demonstrating that changes in the functional BHI within the MF
domain occur in response to certain sympathovagal changes. This is particularly evident for the
second-order MF cumulant C2, and for the first two indices of the non-Gaussian expansion (i.e.
LQ1 and LQ2), suggesting that major differences are associated with the nonlinear dynamics
features of HRV and EEG parameter dynamics. This hypothesis is further supported by the
fact that the first-order MF cumulant (C1), which stems from linear behaviour in the time
domain, detected few significant BHI differences associated with HRV linear dynamics frequency
quantifiers. Of note, first and third non-Gaussian MF indexes (i.e. LQ1 and LQ3) show differences
in the RR- and HR-variance. This might be due to the nonlinear relation between RR and HR,
whose effects on HRV power and variance have been previously characterized [49,50]. More
specifically, LQ1 is associated with the quantification of general departure from Gaussianity and
LQ? is associated with the asymmetry of the distribution. As a consequence, we suggest that the

non-Gaussian features of EEG- and HRV-derived series should be considered when investigating 8
BHI dynamics. : 4

In previous studies, we proved that a strong sympathovagal elicitation as the CPT generally 1
leads to less pronounced MF behaviour separately in the EEG and HRV time series [27,28], as : Ss
