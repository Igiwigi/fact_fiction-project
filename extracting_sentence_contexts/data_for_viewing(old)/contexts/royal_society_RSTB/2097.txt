Some difference of opinion exists on the question how far the stomata of aquatics
are affected by withering. Thus, ScHWENDENERt considered the stomata to be
immovable. Kontt took the opposite view that most water plants have completely
movable stomata. More recently he§ has stated that Salvinia is the only aquatic
plant with motionless stomata.

HapertAnpr|| finds a certain amount of closure, but he thinks Kout’s statement
too sweeping. Sraux{ describes certain plants as having non-shutting stomata. In
face of a good deal of divergence of evidence it seems worth while giving an analysis
of a few experiments on aquatic and marsh plants,

It will be seen that I find movement in many of the stomata, but that I confirm
the main fact—that aquatics, as a class, do not close their stomata to the degree
observable in average land plants,

The following tables give the change in the hygroscope readings after various
“periods of withering,” that is, after the leaves had been cut from the plants and
allowed to lie on the laboratory table for the specified times.
