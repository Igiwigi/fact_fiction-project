The computation of this correction 2a is given in Appendix II; its value, if both
the bearing surface and the knife-edge had been of steel, is shown to be less than 0-54
for any radius of knife-edge between 2-5 and 25y. This corresponds with a correction
to the measured value of g amounting to not more than 5 parts in 10 millions, but since,
in the actual pendulum used, no definite information was available regarding the
elastic constants of the chromium plated planes supported by the steel knife-edge, the
calculated values are not very reliable. The calculated correction, however, is small,
and since the modulus of rigidity of the chromium plating is almost certainly greater
than that of steel, the true value of the correction is probably still smaller, and might
in fact have been neglected in computing the final value of g.

The actual radii of the knife-edges were measured by an adaptation of the method
described by Schmerwitz (1932). The knife-edge was mounted horizontally on a bracket
attached to a horizontal spindle which could be smoothly rotated in a bearing and
the angle of rotation could be measured by means of a micrometer attached to the
end of a 10 in. arm fixed radially to the spindle.
