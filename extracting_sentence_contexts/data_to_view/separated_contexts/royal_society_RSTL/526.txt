That this is the true explanation, appears also, from the result
of adding to the gas a proportion of common air. Thus, when,
at the temperature of 55*, 20 measures of carbonic acid are
agitated with 10 of water, at least 10 measures of gas are taken
up; but, from a mixture of 20 measures of carbonic acid with
10 of common air, 10 parts of water take only 6 of carbonic
acid, or 4, less than in the former instance. An analogous fact was observed by Dr. BRownR166,* who
remarked that gas does not escape from the water which it
impregnates, unless the water be in contact with air : for, when
the Pouhon water was excluded from air, but, at the same time,
liberty was given for its gas to arise into an empty bladder, the
gas did not spontaneously separate from the water ; but, on
the contrary, remained united with it, when exposed to the
greatest heat of our climate. When the impregnated water, he
observes, is thus excluded from air, the gas will escape very
slowly, at any temperature less than 110* of FAHRENHEIT, al-
though such heat be sufficient for the distillation of water ; nor
can it be wholly expelled by a heat of 160? or 170?, continued
two hours.
