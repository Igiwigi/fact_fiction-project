A pile 80 formed has given constant and
distinet signs of a current directed in the muscle from the tendon to the musele. With regard to the intensity, I must add that the 8igns have always been weaker,
from the pile composed of recti femoris, than those from the pile of half legs or gas-
trocnemii muscles. It is very natural that the canse of this difference should be owing to the fact of
the muscular current circulating in a contrary direction to the other. And, in truth,
if the disposition of the elements which compose these piles be eyer $0 little changed,
s0 that the tendon of one of these elements be made to repose upon or near to the
interior of the muscle, the signs of eyery current become very weak or cease alto-
gether (fig. 10.). I have prepared a number of anterior cubital mnscles, or muscles of the fore-arm
of frogs, which likewise have at their extremities, near the carpus, a very distinet
tendinous band.
