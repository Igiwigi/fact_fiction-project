All three isomers are now known. The first of the above formule is that of ethylated
acetone described above, which readily forms a crystalline compound with sodium bi-
sulphite. The second is that of dimethylated acetone, which we believe to be identical
with the body obtained by Firri6 ® in distilling lead acetate, and to which he gave the
name ethyl acetone. Both bodies form crystalline compounds with sodium bisulphite.
The boiling-point of dimethylated acetone is 93%5 C. Frov states that ethyl acetone
boils between 90* and 95%, The only discrepancy between the two compounds is in
their specific grayities, which are as follow :—
Dimethylated acetone - ©8099 at 13*®C.
Ethyl acetone 11 401. |, (oo £842) at 1990;

This discrepancy may perhaps be explained by the fact that Frev1G's ketone yielded
on analysis 0-6 per cent. too much carbon, and 0-4 per cent. too little hydrogen, which
would indicate that it till contained dumasin, from which it had been approximately
separated by fractional distillation.

The name which Frrr1G has applied to his ketone of the above composition implies
that he regarded it as ethylated acetone, but the boiling-point of the latter (101* C.)
precludes this supposition (sce remarks about these boiling-points below).

The third of the above formulee is that of FrevxD'sF ethyl-propionyl prepared by the
