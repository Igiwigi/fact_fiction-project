posterior cardinal veins, or of the ventral ontgrowths from the superficial ossifications
whioh are so conspicnous uo feature i Bagarivs and Glyptosternum, and fo a less
extent in Ahysis also. The stem and ascending process of the post-temporal are very similar to those of
Akysis, "he inner surface of the stem forms the outer boundary, and the reourved
distal portion of the modified transverse process the inner and anterior walls, of the
sockut for the head of the clavicle (eZ). There is no trace of sn inferior lirab, in fact,
this process seams, as it were, to haye been crowded out by the abutment of the
anterior margin of the transyerse process against the posterior and opisthotic plates
of the exovcipital. The air-bladder differs in no essential feature from that of .dhysis, and, as in the
latter Siluvoid, is completely constricted into two small laterally placed air-sacs,
which oceupy the concavities of the modified transverse processes of the fourth)
vertebra (fig. 30, a.8.),* ‘There is no communication between the two sacs, neither is

5 the degenerate condition of its dorsal wall, and the apparent atrophy of the sinus
= endolympliaticns, there is also an extremely close resemblance between the two
yenera, and this agreement furtlier éxtends in almost every detail to the condition of
the Weberian ossicles.
