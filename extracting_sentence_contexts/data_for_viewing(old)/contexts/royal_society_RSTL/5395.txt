be drawn to any third point on the circle, if one of these parabolic arcs touches the
logarithmic ellipse or the logarithmic hyperbola, the other will pass through a fixed
point on the surface of the paraboloid.

6. If on the paraboloid we describe a circle whose radius is /d*+7?, and if from
the extremities of any diameter of this circle we draw parabolic arcs touching the
logarithmic ellipse or the Jogarithmic hyperbola, these tangent parabolic arcs will
meet on the circle.

These theorems will suffice. There would be little difficulty in extending the list.
In fact nearly all the projective properties of right lines and conic sections on a plane
may be transformed into analogous properties of great circles and spherical conic
sections on the surface of a sphere, and of parabolic arcs and logarithmic sections on
the surface of a paraboloid.

LXXXIX. There is a particular class of plane curves, of which the Jemniscate of
BerxoULLi is an example, to which the principles established in the foregoing pages
may be applied with much elegance.

Definition —This entire class of curves may be defined by the following property.
The square of the rectangle under the radii vectores drawn from. the foci to any
