Similarly, if the
speaker negates (51), as in (54), they are negating Sam’s disap-
pointment, not the underlying fact of his smoking. Also,
attempts to carry on the discourse by directly addressing the
factive meaning are considered unacceptable to speakers. Therefore, the factive meaning of regret is encoded as a presup-
position because it projects out of questions and negation.

(53) Does Sam regret having smoked?
a. No, he isn’t disappointed that he smoked. (Assertion)

b. *No, he didn’t smoke. (Presupposition)
(54) Sam doesn’t regret having smoked.

a. He enjoyed smoking a lot. (Assertion)

b. *He didn’t smoke at all! (Presupposition)

A different case comes from the treatment of the verb
acquiesce in (55), which also has at least two components to
its meaning: an acceptance meaning and a reluctance mean-
