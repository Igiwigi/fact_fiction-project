optical bearing, it is convenient to assume that the matter and the ether in contact
with it move together. This is the working hypothesis made by H. Herrz in his
recent treatment of the electrodynamics of moving bodies; it is, in fact, what we
tacitly assume in a straightforward and consistent working out of MAXweELt’s
principles without any plainly-expressed statement on the question of the relative
motion of matter and ether ; for the part played in Maxwett’s theory by matter is
merely (and, of course, roughly) formularised by supposing that it causes the etherial
constants to take different values, whilst introducing new properties, that of dissipating
energy being the most prominent and important. We may, therefore, think of merely
one medium, the most of which is uniform (the ether), whilst certain portions (matter
as well) have different powers of supporting electric displacement and magnetic indue-
tion from the rest, as well as a host of additional properties; and of these we can
include the power of supporting conduction current with dissipation of energy according
to Jouur’s law, the change from isotropy to eolotropy in respect to the distribution
of the several fluxes, the presence of intrinsic sources of energy, &c.*
