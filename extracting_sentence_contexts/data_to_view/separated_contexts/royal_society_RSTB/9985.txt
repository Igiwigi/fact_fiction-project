We examined the combined effects increasing distance. By accommodation, we mean _ the


accommodative response of the eyes and extra-retinal signals
used to measure that response. Some previous studies of stereoscopic depth constancy
have manipulated vergence and vertical-disparity signals and
most showed that both signals are in fact used [21,22,24â€”26]. To the best of our knowledge, only one has presented appropri-
ate accommodation signals and it showed that there was
indeed an effect of the accommodative stimulus [23]. None
examined the effect of the spatial frequency of depth varia-
tion on depth constancy in combination with the effect of
viewing distance.
