Within this, more restricted, set-up we will tackle
the calculation of the energy density of the vacuum fluctuations of a quantized scalar field
in FLRW space-time. For the sake of completeness, we admit the presence of a non-minimal
coupling & of Â¢ to gravity, despite it is not mandatory for renormalizability in this case. Since
there are no self couplings in our calculation, there are no ZPE loops beyond one, and hence
the one-loop contribution that we are addressing here, Vzpgp =f vy, is in fact the full ZPE
result. The calculation entails renormalization subtleties since we meet, of course, UV-divergent
integrals. As noted, conventional approaches such as e.g. the MS scheme, lead to the very
same conflictive terms ~m* as those previously met in Minkowski space.
