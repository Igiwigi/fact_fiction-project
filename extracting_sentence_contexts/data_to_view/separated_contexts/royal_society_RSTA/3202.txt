Discussion

The possibility of a metastable vacuum of the standard model can have drastic consequences
when the current understanding of the cosmological evolution of the universe is included in the
picture: in the early universe where the gravitational dynamics are large a fatal transition to the
true vacuum can occur when the scale of inflation is high. The gravitational dynamics during
cosmological inflation is not the only dangerous epoch but also during the reheating phase after
inflation the instability can materialize. It is an observable fact that currently the Higgs field sits firmly in the electroweak vacuum. Since it is unlikely that in the case when the vacuum decay is triggered in the early universe the
current situation would follow, we can conclude that some stabilizing mechanism, potentially


new physics, must exist in order to stabilize the electroweak vacuum if the scale of inflation is
high. In this manner the standard model vacuum instability in combination with cosmology leads
to an indirect probe of beyond the standard model physics.
