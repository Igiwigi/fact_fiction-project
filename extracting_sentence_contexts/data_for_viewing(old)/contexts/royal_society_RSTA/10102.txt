Similar experiments were made with iron. This could not be introduced in the
same way as the copper, for the metal appeared to become passive in contact with the
strong nitrate solution and refused to dissolve. Two solutions were prepared by
adding 1 gramme of crystallised ferric nitrate to 60 grammes of silver and adding
sulphuretted hydrogen as before. The first solution gave the perfectly normal electro-

chemical equivalent
1°11825 (67d),

and the second, to which much more hydrogen sulphide was added, gave the value
1°11834 (74),

also substantially normal, The ferric nitrate was strongly acid, and this fact must
be taken into account in discussing the above result, but it is clear that the
extraordinarily high electrochemical equivalent of the mother-liquors cannot be
attributed to the presence either of iron or of copper. Addition of ferric nitrate to
the mother-liquor produced no marked change in the electrochemical equivalent, the
value obtained being 1:12141 (27b) and 1:12055 (30c) before and 1°12171 (74d) after
the addition of 1 gramme of ferric nitrate to about 400 cub. centims. of 15 per cent,

mother-liquor.

The abnormally high deposits obtained with the silver voltameter have usually
been attributed to anodic impurities. Such impurities would normally be oxidised
