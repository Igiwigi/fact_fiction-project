(1) First-set grafts

The graft ranking. Evidence that the ranking of the graft series according to speed of
their breakdown is unlikely to have been biased, or at any rate biased positively, to any
significant degree by the cell populations of the grafts is provided by the fact that the
12-day grafts (on which the ranking was based almost entirely) yielded no significant
regression, while the 8-day grafts did. Sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin were
used to decide the ranking, so that the pyronin cells were indistinguishable from the
lymphocytes. Analysis of variance.
