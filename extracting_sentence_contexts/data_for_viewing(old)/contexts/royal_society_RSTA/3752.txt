the energies in table 4. The results in figure 10 indicate that the statistical EGME model does a
reasonable job predicting the competition between reaction and relaxation within ‘system’ atoms.
The agreement is particularly good at the lower energies, and slightly worse at higher energies.
This is perhaps not an entirely unexpected result, since it is probably the case that non-statistical
ballistic effects (which have a more accurate physical treatment in the MD simulations) are more
important at higher energies.

The agreement between the MD and EGME results, while not perfect, is certainly surprising
considering the number of approximations involved in formulating the EGME model, including:
(i) the statistical approximation that is the basis for microcanonical transition-state theory, which
neglects ballistic dynamical effects, and assumes that energy within the system is distributed
ergodically; (ii) the fact that the boundary chosen to divide the system and the bath cuts across
covalent bonds within the diamond slab; (iii) the fact that the energy transfer function F(E < E’)
was fitted to a correlation function obtained from linear response theory using MD results from
a single equilibrium NVE simulation, (iv) the approximate nature of the energy transfer function
F(E <E’), which is unable to capture the finer dynamical structure of the correlation function
obtained from MD simulations; and (v) the assumption that the rate at which the bath removes
energy from the system is independent of where precisely that energy is located—i.e. the system
is homogeneously coupled to the bath phonon modes.


6. Conclusion

In this work, we have carried out a detailed study of etching kinetics at the diamond surface
under typical CVD conditions using MD simulations, and also a statistical EGME model. The aim
