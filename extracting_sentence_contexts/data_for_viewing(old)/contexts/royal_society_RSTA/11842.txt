3 2 crystals there is a plane of chemical weakness parallel to the basal plane (OR., 100).
S This i is shown by the frequency of a pearly lustre on that face, due to the development
= of films of diaspore within the crystal, and sometimes also by a tendency of the crystal
Eto break up parallel to this plane. Now the presence of this plane of chemical weak-
3 ness is very strikingly exhibited by some Burmese rubies.
& Fig. 18 represents a much-altered ruby crystal, magnified four diameters. The
% basal plane has been attacked irregularly, and the deep holes @ and b show how
3 $ capriciously such erosive action sometimes goes on ; at ¢ we have a rhombohedral face
undergoing the kind of exfoliation, of which we are about to speak as characteristic
A of those planes of the crystal, but at its upper part, d, we see that the crystal is made
up near the much-weathered basal plane of alternate layers of corundum and diaspore.
The same fact is still better shown on the fractured surface f. It is this alternation
of diaspore layers which gives the pearly lustre so often exhibited on the basal plane
of corunduin crystals,

When, in consequence of pressure, gliding planes (similar to those produced in
calcite) have been formed in corundum, chemical action tends to take place along
these gliding or secondary twinning planes.

In rubies embedded in the limestone, the faces parallel to the rhombohedron are
