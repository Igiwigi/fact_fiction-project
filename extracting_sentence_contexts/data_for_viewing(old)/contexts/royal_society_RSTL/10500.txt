The contradictory behaviour of the sulphate to water (99) was now easily exp!
The insoluble erystals, which from the brillianey of their phosphorescent spectrum
had at first mistaken for the nearly pure sulphate of z, were merely calcic or stronti
sulphate contaminated with perhaps nob more than the one ten-thousandth park of
sulphate which it had carried down with them on crystallising.

116. In the corresponding yttrium research I was aided materially by the fact that
the sought-for earth did not give an absorption spectrum (42). This enabled me to
throw out a large number of obscurely known elements, and I therefore early
endeavoured to ascertain whether the supposed new earth, , did or did not give an
absorption spectrum. At firsb I could nob decide one way or the other. I frequently
obtained a good orange-band spectrum when the solutions gave no trace of absorption
spectrum, whilst on other occasions the 80lution showed good didymium and other
bands. Gradually, however, it was noticed that whenever the didymium absorption
bands were strong the orange-band spectrum was also particularly brilliant. More-
over, amongst the earths enumerated in par. 113 as mixed with lime in the quesb
for x, I have mentioned that some of them gave the orange-band spectrum with
increased intensity ; the earths of the cerium gronp were the most noteworthy, and
these considerations made it probable that here would be found the location of &.
