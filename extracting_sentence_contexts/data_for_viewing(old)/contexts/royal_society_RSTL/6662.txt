possibly about ten or twelve years old. But apparently the most frequent arrangement
in the adult is that the crista incisiva is prolonged backwards xo as to articulate with the
maxillaries behind the anterior palatine canal; and in that case, as the maxillary margin
of the vomer falls short of the canal, the process in question does not. exist.

At an early age the vomer begins to lose its characteristic form and its individuality ;
and the sphenoidal spongy bones lose theirs eyen s0oner. In consequence of this, the
ordinary descriptions, however faithfully they may give an account of the appearances
in adult skulls, are imperfect as descriptions of these separate bones. The fact is that
the maturity of a skull does not correspond with the period of most perfect development
of the individual bones of which it is composed. This is recognized by us when we
resort to young skulls for specimens of disarticulated bones, and would be acknowledged

Still more readily in describing an elephant's skull or a whale's; but, with regard to
he bones in question, the period of this most characteristic condition is s0 early that it
Saas escaped due attention, and the natural result has followed, that the adult appear-
Snces have not been properly understood.
S The alterations which the sphenoidal spongy bones undergo take place in connexion
Frith the increased hollowing out of the sphenoidal sinuses. As these sinuses dilate, the
vuperior plates of the spongy bones are pressed against the body of the presphenoid,
-Zyhich also becomes narrowed and deepened, until, instead of a thick bone in the middle
