BIONOMICS AND REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES OF THE FORAMINIFERA. 247

a
3 shallow water dredging, or littoral gathering, where the genus Discorbina is
; represented by a wide range of species. If we look at the pair in which the

disparity of size is most striking, it will be seen at once that it is, if I may say so,
absurd to imagine that a process of “ copulation”! is taking place between the fully
developed adult organism, on the one hand, and the tiny and very elementarily
developed individual which is adherent to its aperture in this specimen. Whilst the
adult (I allow myself this term and also the term “juvenile” for purposes of
definition and demonstration) possesses the full complement of chamberlets which
is normal to the species, the juvenile cannot by any means be discovered to consist
=, of more than one very elementary chamberlet, in point of fact, a primordial
&  chamber.2 From this point the figures (which, like all other figures illustrating
8 this paper, are drawn from actual specimens and photographs) show a gradual
8  progressional development of the attached juvenile, the size of the adult remaining
> constant. I may call attention to the fact that (though this species is a very common
Q one, occurring often in relatively enormous numbers in a dredging or a shore-

§ gathering), whether it is found perfect, that is to say, with its base closed in, and
S> delicately striated (which is one of the distinguishing marks of the species), or
ep whether the base is broken away, indicating, in my opinion, that it has been
‘3 =“ encysted” or attached—(not adherent)—or whether the neat hole occurs in the
Ss _cbase as in figs. 13 and 14, showing the contained young, or revealing a quite empty
& outer case from which the young have escaped (as in figs. 23 and 24), the size of the
2 species is (within narrow limits) constant, and though it is the commonest incident
2 of one’s search, when systematising a gathering, to find in the finest siftings
= relatively microscopic specimens of forms which one has found large and adult in
= the coarser siftings, so far as an experience of over twenty years has enabled me
£ to observe, the tiny undeveloped individuals which I am referring to as “ juveniles,”
g which might presumably be found seeking their more fully developed “ mates,”
& have never been observed—which I think I am justified in saying would have been
3 the case if these associated pairs represented a syngamy of any kind. It would
S therefore appear that (as I believe to be the case) the ‘‘ budded off” individual is
& seldom or never cast loose from its parent until it has attained a practical equality
Qin size, and degree of development.
