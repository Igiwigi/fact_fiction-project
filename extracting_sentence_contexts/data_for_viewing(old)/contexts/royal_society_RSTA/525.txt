of fully ionized plasma at multi-million degrees. In a recent historical note, Peter & Dwivedi
[11] assign the merit to Alfvén [12], who summarized six arguments that support the corona
being heated to such high temperatures. Since then, solar physics research has sought to identify
the physical mechanism(s) that might balance the thermal conduction, radiation and solar wind
losses, first quantified by Withbroe & Noyes [2]. Researchers in the field agree upon the fact that
the origin for such temperatures is of a magnetic nature and that the energy source lies in the
solar surface plasma motions. This available energy is then transported to the upper layers of the
solar atmosphere where it gets dissipated. The exact physical processes and their contribution to
the heating of the plasma remain largely unknown or unquantified [8].

A number of mechanisms are believed to contribute to the heating: the direct dissipation of
magnetic energy by processes such as magnetic reconnection [13], current cascades [14], viscous
turbulence [15] or magnetic field braiding [16]; the dissipation of magnetic wave energy stored,

transported and transferred to small scales by waves [17-21]; or the mass flow cycle between : =
chromosphere and corona [22] are some suggested mechanisms. There is ample evidence for : yy
the occurrence of magnetic reconnection processes [23]; magnetic wave dynamics [24]; and 2
