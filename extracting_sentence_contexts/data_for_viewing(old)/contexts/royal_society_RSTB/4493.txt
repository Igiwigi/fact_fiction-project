They are said to be 17 in number and without ribs
or diapophyses. :

The Ribs (figs. 40, 44).—In all but those of the
second and third vertebre the ribs are two-headed,
the tubercular process extending about 4 mm. or
5 mm. beyond the capitulum. All the ribs have
suffered some displacement, and are now folded back
against the sides of the vertebral column, round
which they curl to cross one another below on the
ventral surface. This singular disposition has been
noticed already by Case in his specimens. It is Fic. 44.—R. &., ribs crossing each other

be implied by this. The tuberculum lies close to (All from specimen 1; x 4.)
the transverse process, usually just beneath it ;
the capitulum against the side of the centrum which offers no definite facet for its
articulation. Where the rib bends away from the capitulum it is compressed from
side to side, so that a transverse section is about twice as high (2 mm.) as broad
