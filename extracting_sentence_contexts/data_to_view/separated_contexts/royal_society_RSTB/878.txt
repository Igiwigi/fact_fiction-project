In some places the teeth have been

forcibly broken away, leaving a portion of the fang still cemented to the parapet. One of the fangs shows a slight depression at the lower part, apparently indicating
absorption by the pressure of a young tooth, such as takes place in Iguana and other
‘ Lizards. Asa matter of fact the dentition of this specimen agrees so closely with
| that of Iguana that the above description would answer equally well for the one or
| the other, the only differences between the two being that the teeth of the present
_ specimen are proportionately larger and fewer in number, there being only twelve on
_ each side, while Iguana has double that number, and the crowns are less pointed and
Sthave no median ridge. Allusion has already been made to the ridges along the
‘palate, and to the probability of some of them at least having supported teeth. There will be occasion to speak of this again when considering the affinities of this
unique Reptile.

i The extreme development of horns on this Elgin skull reminds one forcibly of the
‘8 Australian Moloch and the American Phrynosoma, but although the Elgin Reptile
undoubtedly possesses several important Lacertilian characters, and apparently finds
Zits nearest living allies in that group, yet it presents peculiarities of structure which
Bprevents its being referred to the Lacertilia.
