736 MR, G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZE.

VI. POISONS.

The Jast subject of which I shall treat in the present communication is the effects
of various muscle- and nerve-poisons on the locomotor system of Meduse. In my former
paper I dealt briefly with this subject; but, having this year bestowed a considerable
amount of additional labour upon it, I shall now disenss it at 8omeyhat greater length.
The subject appears to me one of considerable importance, seeing that the effects of the
muscle- and nerve-poisons have never, as yet, been systematically tried on'the Medusw—
animals that present us with the earliest appearance both of muscle and of nerve, I make
this remark in order to excuse myself for burdening this already over-lengthy paper with
a number of additional facts, which will be of interest only to the physiologist.

$ 1. Chloroform.—My observations with regard to the distribution of neryes in Sarsia
led me to investigate the order in which these connexions are destroyed, or temporarily
impaired, by anzesthetics. The results, I think, are worth recording. In Sarsia, then,
the following phases always mark the progress of anzesthesia by chloroform &e, ;—
1. Spontaneity ceases, as described in my former paper. 2. On now nipping a tentacle,
pulling the polypite, or irritating the bell, a single locomotor contraction is given in
answer to eyery stimulation. (In the unanesthesiated animal a serves of 8nch contrac-
tions would be the result of snch stimulation.) 3. After locomotor contractions can no
longer be elicited by stimuli, nipping a tentacle or the margin of the bell has the effect
of causing the polypite to contract, 4. After stimulation of any part of the nectocalyx
(including tentacles) fails to produce response in any part of the organism, the polypite
