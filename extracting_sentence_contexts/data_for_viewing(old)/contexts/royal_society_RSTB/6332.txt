Formation of buds—There is no post-abdomen so that the synoicid type of budding
is precluded. At the same time the stolonic blood vessel is small and insignificant
and most unlikely to form a budding stolon. A few zooids were discovered, two of
which are figured, that indicate a process of budding similar to that of Diazona,
even though there has been an extreme reduction in body-size from that genus,
fig. 7.

The thoracic region is absorbed, large trophocytes accumulate in the oesophageal
and abdominal regions, a series of constrictions divide the posterior part into three
or four masses, the most posterior mass containing the heart and stomach, the others
sections of the oesophagus and intestine.

This number would account for the fact that the zooids of a colony are usually
raised from the general surface in closely united clusters of three or four.

Sections of the strobilating zooids show that there is an active proliferation of
epicardial cells as in Diazona and synoicids, and also that the epidermal constrictions
are to be associated with a change from a cubical to a columnar type of epithelium.
The inner tissues are merely passively cut through.
