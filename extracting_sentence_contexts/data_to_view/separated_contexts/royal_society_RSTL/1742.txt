VII, also
by the simple process, produced, in a long wire whose mag-
netisgm had been totally destroyed by heating to redness, a
lifting power of 186 grains; and the first 5 blows, in ex-


developement of magnetical properties in Steel and iron, &c. 21g

periment No. XIII, on'a- new wire by the compound process,
occasioned in-this wire, of only 145 grains weight, a lifting
power of 265 grains.

3. The increased magnetic energy developed by the use
of larger bars of iron (a fact indeed which it was reasonable
to expect). is quite satisfactory in all-the comparative experi-
ments. The long wire St ii, by the small apparatus was made
to lift between 326 and 389 grains, being the highest effect
produced on: it [Experiment No. VII] ; but on applying it to
the large apparatus, its lifting power was at length aug-
mented to 662 grains. [Experiment XVI.] And by the small
apparatus, the highest power that could be given to the wire
Sti, was a capability of lifting a weight of $345 grains [Ex-
periments II, III, IV,7] ; but on using the large apparatus,

_ the same wire [Experiment XIV.] was eventually made to

lift 669 grains, being above four times its own weight.
