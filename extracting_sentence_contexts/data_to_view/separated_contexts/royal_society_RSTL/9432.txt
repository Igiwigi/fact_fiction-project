But the healing process rapidly
continuing, adherence rapidly extended along the whole line of incision, and generally
in from twelve to twenty hours this adherence was complete. By observing carefully,
however, there might still be seen a cicatrix marking out the line of previous incision,
though in the course of next, day this too disappeared, leaving no trace behind of the
previous injury. It is an unfortunate circumstance that I found it impossible to procure any micro-
scopical preparations of these lines of incision, owing to the fact that all the hardening
and staining reagents immediately caused the newly-healed muscle-fibres again to
rupture. After many trials T was therefore at last obliged to satisfy myself with an
examination of the newly-healed tissues in their fresh state. I was particularly

through narrow necks of tissue depended for its re-establishment upon the regeneration
