The addition of the superphosphate to the ammonia-salts increased the average
amount of produce by more than one-third, the annual yield of nitrogen by about one-
fifth, and that of the mineral matter taken up about in the proportion of from two to
three. Not only was there very considerable increase in the amount taken up of those
constituents which were supplied by the © superphosphate ” (lime, some magnesia,
phosphorie acid, and sulphuric acid), but there was also a considerably larger amount, of
both potass and silica, to say nothing of soda and chlorine, taken up, though neither
of these was supplied. There is in these facts clear evidence of the defective-supply
of minerals on plot 5 compared with plot 4-2; but, inasgmuch as the amounts of

8everal of the mineral constituents taken up declined in the later years in about the
game proportion on plot 4-2 as on plot 5, and the quantity of potass (which was not
supplied) did 80 even in a much greater degree, it is obvious that there was still very
considerable deficiency of some of the mineral constituents required. The following Table (LXXVIL., pp.
