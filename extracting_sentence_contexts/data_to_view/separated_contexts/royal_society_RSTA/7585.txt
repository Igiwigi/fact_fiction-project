If we increase the number of observations,

n, the bias tends to zero, which justifies the terms “‘ almost unbiassed ” or “ con-
sistent ’’ estimate attached to (14).

(c) Estimation by Unique Estimate and by Interval

In the preceding pages we have described briefly three of the several important
principles advanced for the calculation of estimates. All of them represent attempts
to solve the problem which might be called the problem of a unique estimate of an
unknown parameter which reduces to determining a function of the observations,
the value of which presumably does not differ very much from that of the estimated
parameter. We shall now call attention to the fact that apart from the problem of a unique
estimate, the requirements of practical statistical work brought to the front another
problem which we shall call the problem of estimation by interval. Denote generally by 6 the parameter to be estimated and by T its estimate, deduced
from some principle or another. Whatever the principle, it is obviously impossible
to assume that in any particular case T is exactly equal to 8.
