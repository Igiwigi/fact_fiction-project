The lengthy exposure required for good hair photographs is an indication
that only a fraction of the hair substance is in a true, or approximately true, crystalline
state, and what we know of “ amorphous ” X-ray halos would lead us to expect a diffuse
reflection of the kind observed. Amorphous halos tend to reveal the ‘* most probable ”’
inter- or intra-molecular distances in a non-crystalline system ; and the non-crystalline
fraction of the hair substance, being built of combinations of «-amino acids which must
have certain relatively small spacings in common, would naturally yield such a halo. In addition, the effect will be further enhanced by a certain proportion of matter, in
heterogeneous orientation, corresponding to the aligned crystallites which give rise to
the «-photograph described above. ‘That there actually is some crystalline protein in
random orientation is shown by the fact that in several of the photographs obtained a
weak ‘‘ powder ring” can be traced passing through (001).
