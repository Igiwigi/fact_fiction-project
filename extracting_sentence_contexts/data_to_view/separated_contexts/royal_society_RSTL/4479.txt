Were it, for example, a hydride of silver which was thus decomposed and water
formed and not simply oxygen, the experiment would have attracted no attention. On the view TI have given, the formation of the oxygen itself is as truly a chemical
synthesis as the formation of water, and may be substituted for it in a chemical
change. This supplies an explanation of these facts at once adequate and imple;
the oxide of silver in this experiment being reduced by the oxygen of the peroxide
of hydrogen, just as in other cases it might be by hydrogen; the formation of
the silyer from the particles of which it is composed being the corresponding fact
in the decomposition of the oxide of silyer to the formation of water in the peroxide,
80 that we may represent the change thus :â€”

t=+=+, =
HO O O Ag Agtz=HO+0,+Ag. wlll Zee If

No one can be more sensible than I am of the wide interval which exists between
such a mode of representing a chemical change and an ascertained fact.
