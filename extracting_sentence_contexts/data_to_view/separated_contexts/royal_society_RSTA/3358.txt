Consequently, if we
write the wavefunctions of the states |y(I”)) in the unpertubed energy eigenbasis

WX) = (xlW(P)),

we expect that these will converge to Kronecker delta functions as |(I")) changes into the
corresponding unperturbed eigenstate |a); this means that the state |y(I")) will be localized for
small I”. In the previous section, we saw that, in the large I" limit, these states are delocalized, so
we expect that there will be a value I, where transition between these two behaviours occurs. In
fact, if we write the Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of Ho, we get

H=-)°Eala)(al — > (alVia’)Ia) (a. (4.1)

This is related to the Anderson model that describes a particle hopping on a lattice while under
the effect of a disordered potential. This model is known to enter a localized phase when the
disordered term dominates the hopping term. In equation (4.1), the unperturbed energies {E,} are
the equivalent of a disordered potential, while the values I (a|V|a’) are the hopping coefficients
for the particle.
