The point is that one linkage adds two constraints,
but the other linkage is formed by the correct orientation of this new square (as anticipated in the analysis of the rods shown in
figure 2), which means adding just one new constraint. Thus the number of additional degrees of freedom and constraints are
the same, and thus we will retain F â€” C = 4 for whatever size we now make the structure. (Online version in colour.)

Figure 7. Demonstration of the fact that a two-dimensional network of triangles connected within hexagonal rings has lines
of RUM wave vectors. We start with the arrangement labelled 1. With six triangles and six linkages, we have 18 d.f. and 12
constraints.
