grounds, as the horizontal links respond to the linear vertical deformation of the transverse links,
which have a small contrast in length dictated by A. A small vertical deformation therefore
does not produce a large extension in the horizontal links. Also, as the anisotropy parameter
a increases, figure 7 shows that the magnitude of @ increases. This result is due to the fact that
increasing a corresponds to a softening of the lateral links in the medium, enabling the horizontal
links to undergo greater axial deformations.

It can also be clearly seen from figure 7 that for all admissible speeds of bridge crack failure the
parameter a is less than 1. As a consequence, if the horizontal links inside the chain are assumed
to have the same strength as the vertical links, all admissible bridge crack regimes are realizable
in the structures considered.

Here, our conclusions are based on the fact that all links in the structure possess the same
strength. The results leading to these evaluations use the solution from [36], which gives
the profile of the chain during steady bridge failure regimes. These profiles are obtained
independently of any information on the behaviour of vertical odd-numbered links and
horizontal links through, for instance, 6 and w, respectively. Of course, it is immediately clear
that in all cases considered, assuming that the horizontal links have a much lower strength
than the even-numbered vertical links would reduce the possibilities for potential steady
bridge crack regimes to exist. Figures 5-7 then become essential in identifying the existence
of the emerging failure regimes when stable bridge crack regimes are no longer supported by
the system.
