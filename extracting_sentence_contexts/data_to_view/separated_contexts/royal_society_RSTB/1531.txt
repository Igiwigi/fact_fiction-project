In the deeper part of the stroma, the cells forming the walls of the hypertrophied
vessels become again of normal size and consistency, and the stroma tissue is also
reduced in bulk, assuming again the conditions which are found during the resting
stage. With regard to the leucocytes, I have no further evidence to offer ; 1 would merely
say that the opinion I have already expressed with regard to their presence during
the menstruation of S. entellus, is confirmed by the observations I have made on
M. rhesus. If MercuntKorr’s conclusions are to be relied upon, the presence of
leucocytes in such large numbers in the vessels of the mucosa during menstruation, is
evidence of a noxious material therein, while the fact that diapedesis does not occur,
shows that the irritant does not extend to the surrounding tissue. Menstruation,
then, cannot be considered to be an inflammatory process. The considerable flow of blood from the ruptured vessels during menstruation would
seem to get rid completely of this irritant, and this is itself sufficient to explain the
disappearance of the comparatively few leucocytes which are left after denudation
has taken place.
