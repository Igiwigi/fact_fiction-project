There is
a good blood supply, and the general impression gained is certainly that of an excretory
organ. Suggested functions of this gland are that it is salivary or else excretory. The fact that
its products will inevitably be carried by ciliary action on the mantle into the waste
canals for speedy removal really disposes of the first suggestion. Stenta thought the
gland was excretory, partly, however, because he considered that pericardial glands were
not present in the Pinnidae. White (1942) has since reported their presence in some,
though absence in other, species of Pinna.
