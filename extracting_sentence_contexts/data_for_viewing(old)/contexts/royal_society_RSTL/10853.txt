effects of hysteresis were absent. In that case it would be a matter of indifference
whether stress were applied before magnetising force, or magnetising force before
stress. Hysteresis affects both experiments, though quite differently, but by
examining the two sets of curves together we can see the general relations of mag-
netic susceptibility to stress in the features which are exhibited by both. From the
two together we may confidently conclude that the influence of pull on magnetism |
is positive until the magnetisation is 80 much raised as to bring about the Vir
reversal ; that this positive effect is slight at low magnetisations, and increases greatly
80 as to pass a maximum before reversal ; that the amount of this positive effect;
depends on the amount of stress applied, passing a maximum whose position varies in
the way stated above; that the value of the magnetisation at which the VILLARI
reversal occurs depends on the value of the stress, being lower the greater the stress.”
In fact, if we deal only with very small stresses it is doubtful whether any reversal
of the positive effect of stress would be reached even at the highesb attainable value of
the magnetisation.

$ 96. Residual Effects of Stress Changes occurring when the Wire is free from
Magnetism.—During the progress of some experiments of the same type as those jusb
recorded, but preliminary to them, a very curious phenomenon was noticed, which
gave a fresh and interesting example of the presence of hysteresis in a somewhab
occult form. |

If we take an iron wire which has already been stretched beyond its original limit of
elasticity, and which has, therefore, reached a table state as regards any subsequent
applications of lesser pull, we may load and unload and magnetise i as we please, but
