The real importance of the accuracy of G is arguably that it can be taken as a
measure, in popular culture, of how well we understand our most familiar force: the discrepant
results may signify some new physics, or they may demonstrate that we do not understand the
metrology of measuring weak forces. Owing to the lack of theoretical understanding of gravity,
as alluded to earlier, there is an abundance of respectable theories that predict violations of
the inverse square law or violations of the universality of free fall. In fact, a growing view is
that G is not truly universal and may depend on matter density on astrophysical scales, for
example. A misunderstanding of the metrology of weak force physics may in turn imply that
the experimental tests that have established the inverse square law and the universality of free
fall thus far are flawed in some subtle fashion. This makes for a potentially exciting situation and
perhaps explains the general interest shown in our apparently mundane and painstaking work
onG.
