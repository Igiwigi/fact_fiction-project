and calculating from the second and fifth values of corresponding co-ordinates in the
above list, we find, .
k = 0°847, h = 133 mm.

The calculated height is therefore 13°3 against the measured value 13°2, so that the
result is accurate to | part in 130. With y = 8°6, we find by calculation, « = 2°38
against the observed value 2°35. The other values are reproduced with similar
accuracy, and we conclude that the undistorted curve is strictly parabolic, and that
the probability distribution of intensity is correct for the case of the Hydrogen lines
in the ordinary discharge. The intensity at a distance \X—), from the maximum at A,
is proportional to exp —k* (A—),)? where * is some constant. The plate to which the
above typical calculation relates is, in fact, much smaller than the others, so that the
accuracy there obtained is a minimum. It is much greater in the calculations from the
other plates, and we may, therefore, conclude that calculated distances are only
subject to a possible error of about 1 part in 100 at most, and an error even less if
the mean of several calculations is taken. The material is, therefore, at hand for
a very accurate determination of the separation in H, and Hg.

The actual plates were taken slightly out of focus, in order to remove the trouble
caused by the grain of the plate. The exactness of the parabolic forms which the
