power, being as essentially a vital organ as the heart or lungs, as will more
fully appear, I think, from the review of facts which I now beg leave to submit
to the Society.

For the last fifteen years I have been engaged in an experimental inquiry
relating to the laws of the vital functions; and have from time to time laid
the results before the Royal Society in six papers, which the Society has done

from which I never deviated, has been to repeat each experiment till no doubt
respecting the result remained in the mind of any one present ; and it is satis-
factory to me to be enabled to state, that, although many of these experiments
have been repeated by the physiologists both of this country and the continent,
they have in no instance been found inaccurate. I have always abstained
