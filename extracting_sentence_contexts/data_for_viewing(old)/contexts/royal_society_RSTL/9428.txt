The first rift in the discharge, following the first onthurst, is zometimes distinguishable even as far as
the positive terminal ; and perhaps in those cases indicates a real cessation of the discharge. 'This is
corroborated by the fact that a similar interruption is then perceptible in the glow surrounding the
negative terminal ; but after this the negative glow retains its unbroken character throughout the entire

discharge.

usually followed by an apparently complete cessation of discharge ; ib then recom-
menced, and continued to exhibit during its entire period of existence variations of a
very irregular kind. It is, in fact, probable that during the period subsequent to the
first outburst and the momentary cessation of discharge that often follows it, the state
of the tube is much the same as it would be during a continuous discharge, in
consequence of the absence of any regularity of pulsation. The tube is always
conducting a discharge, although perhaps the consequent disturbance is more violent
in one part than in another. There is no alternation of a sharply-defined discharge and
electrical emptiness. So important is the distinction between what may be called
regularly fluctuating and periodically intermittent discharges, that in the case of
J fairly rapid coil discharge it is frequently found that, while the striz in the main
Emninosity give but very slight traces of sensitiveness, the faint ghostly striz which
=Ere een to project far beyond the end of the positive column proper show very great
Sensitiveness (see Plate 16, fig. 6).* And the experiments above referred to with
De revolving mirror show that this faint column of luminosity is due solely to the first
