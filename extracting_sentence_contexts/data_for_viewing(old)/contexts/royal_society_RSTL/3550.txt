expressions are obtained by PoxTiicouLan#, will show the convenience of using the
coefficients {c;, c;} instead of [c; &] (in PoxTEcouLant's notation (c;, c)).

[It will be observed that the formulz for (:)', 7, / at the end of the last article,
do not agree with those of PoxTECOULANT (p. 330) for the variations of the corre-
sponding quantities s, w, @. 'The reason of this is as follows :—In PoxTEcouLanT's
notation © expresses the same as - in this paper, and « the same as y. But @ (the
longitude of the perihelion) is not the same as ; the former being measured entirely
in the plane of the orbit from a radius vector, fied in that planeF, and assumed as
the origin of longitudes. Consequently z, in PoxTEcouLaxT (which we will call s, for
distinction), is not the same as (z) in the present paper. In fact, if we equate the
expressions for the mean anomaly in the two notations, we have

4—o=(:;)—7;
also it is evident that if we put for the angle between the node and the origin from
which @ is measured, we have dB= = cos ud, and 7=»+B+2, $0 that
da=du+(1—cos:)dv.

If then it were allowable to consider R as capable of being expressed as a function of
» and +, instead of @ and (z), and if we represented by (R) the expression for R 80
transformed, we should have
