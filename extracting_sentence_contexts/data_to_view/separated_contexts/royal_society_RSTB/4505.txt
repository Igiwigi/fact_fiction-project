The prototype of the worker can be explained as
having arisen as a mutation of the nymph stage, and characterised by the absence of
wing rudiments, and the possession of a markedly larger head and jaws than those of
the race from which it sprang, Natural selection would then come into play and
favour the increased development of useful characters, and the degeneration of
certain others, along lines already suggested by WrIsMANN (loc. cit.). It is probable
that the soldier caste similarly arose by a further mutation or series of mutations. The fact that transitional forms, intermediate in character between the soldier,
worker, and winged castes, are practically unknown argues in favour of these
mutations being inherited according to the laws of Mendelian segregation. I hope
to show in this essay that such an interpretation appears to offer a more consistent
explanation of the varied phenomena associated with Termite polymorphism than any
hypothesis hitherto put forward. The presence of worker-like individuals in Archotermopsis has a direct bianiny upon
the origin of the worker castes among Termites.
