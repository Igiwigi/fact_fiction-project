Table I. shows at once how variable an element P is. It is at least doubtful
whether even seven years are sufficient to give an annual inequality which can be
relied on as fully representative in its details. There is unquestionably a well-marked
minimum near midsummer. There seems also to be a second minimum in January,
but whether this would be shown—or if shown would be as prominent—if we had
70 years instead of 7 is open to doubt. The fact that the largest mean monthly
value did not occur in January in any one of the seven years, whilst occurring
four times in December, is so far confirmatory. In November, December, and
January, however, fog is a very uncertain while very important influence. During
thick fog in winter P is usually abnormally high, 400 to 600 volts—or practically
double the ordinary gradient—being not infrequently met with. Thus in winter the
mean value of P varies much from day to day even in fair weather. For instance, in
December, 1898, the last three of the selected days gave a mean value for P of
380 volts, whilst the corresponding mean from the first seven days only slightly
exceeded 100 volts. So, again, in January, 1899, the mean values of P from the
first five and the last five of the selected days were roughly 160 and 400 volts
respectively.. The figures in Table I. itself, e.g., those for December in the years
1899 and 1901, afford examples almost as striking.
