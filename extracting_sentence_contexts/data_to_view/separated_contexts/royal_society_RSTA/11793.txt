It will te seen that
this curve is in remarkably close agreement with the original asymmetrical frequency-
curve, an agreement quite as close as we could reasonably expect from the com-

parative smallness of the number of individuals dealt with, and the resulting fact
that the observation-curve can at best only be an approximation to the true
resultant.

2nd Solution—Precisely similar calculations were undertaken for the value
py = — 6'724, and it will, accordingly, be sufficient to cite the final conclusions
here. Quadratic for y: y* — 3412y — 6°724 = 0.
