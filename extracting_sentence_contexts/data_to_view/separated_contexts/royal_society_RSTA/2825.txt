The aim here is to explore how hyperthermals kill plants and animals, both in the
sea and on land, using the Permian—Triassic mass extinction as the exemplar event, because it has
been most studied, but it provides models applicable to all hyperthermal-driven crises on Earth. The idea that large igneous province (LIP) volcanism might have caused mass extinctions
emerged through the 1980s and 1990s, when Rampino & Stothers [1] and Courtillot [2
documented the coincidence of timing between phases of LIP volcanism and mass extinctions. The link between volcanism and killing had in fact been noted earlier, when Vogt [3] suggested

that the eruption of the Deccan Traps in India had triggered the Cretaceous—Palaeogene mass : =
extinction (KPgME) by poisoning life with trace metals. Other killing agencies explored in those : a

The debate became mainstream following the publication of the classic Alvarez paper in 1980 [5], : XS

Whereas some argued that asteroid impact was the main driver of mass extinctions, and that : =
such impacts even followed a regular periodicity [6], that view has been largely abandoned :$

through lack of evidence [7]. In a recent review of mass extinctions, Bond & Grasby [8] identify
five major global extinction events and 12 other mass extinctions through the past 500 Myr.
