102. The equations of the cuspidal curve are in the first insance obtained in the form

| L, M, 3N |=0.
| 1220, L, —4M |
Consider the two equations
1? —12z0M=0,
LM+ 9:wN =0,
each of the fourth order, but which are satisfied by zw=0, L=0; that is, by
(w=0, y*=0), (z=0, 4*+4xw=0). The line (w=0, y=0) however presents itself in
the intersection of the two surfaces, not twice only, but 4 times. To show this, observe
that the line in question is a nodal line on the surface 1:—12:0M=—0; in fact, attending
ouly to the terms of the second order in y, w, we find
{(4a+12c2)—144exz—1440d2w—24dzzyw=0,

giving the two sheets
{(4r+12c2Y—144cr2—1446d2*}w —24dxzy=0 and w=0;
in regard to the last-mentioned sheet the form in the vicinity thereof is given by w=Ay?,

viz, we have approximately L=y*, M=2dy, and thence y*—122. Ay*. 24xy=0, that is,
