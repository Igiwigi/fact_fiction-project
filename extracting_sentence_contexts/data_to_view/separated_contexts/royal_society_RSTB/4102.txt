of the roots of the plexus, the importance of the procedure in the operation when
excision was practised lies in the fact that both fifth and sixth roots were divided. In an older patient, in whom partial recovery had occurred, it might be expected that
section of the fifth and sixth roots would cause an addition to the paralysis, but
hitherto I have in these older cases confined the operative intervention to removal of
compressing scars. Of the many excisions in infants, however, none have shown
increase of the distribution of the paralysis after the operation, although that has
involved the excision of the segment of junction of the fifth and sixth nerves.
