They are undoubtedly the casts of acerate and brifid siliceous spicules, and they are
sufficiently numerous to show that the silica derived from the solution of the contained
spicules can have produced the colloid material of which the rock principally consists. There can be no doubt that this malm rock is derived from the spicules of siliceous
8ponges. Messrs. Way and Paixe first called attention to the fact that the Farnbam malm
and firestone contain a large amount, varying from 25 to 75 per cent., of soluble
silica, but they do not appear to have noticed the peculiar globular form in which the
silica has been deposited, and* they deny its organic origin. Selborne, Hampshire.â€” The malm rock is well shown in the quarries at this village,
where a section of 15 feet (4:5 m.) is exposed ; also in road-cuttings and on the
surfaces of the adjoining fields.
