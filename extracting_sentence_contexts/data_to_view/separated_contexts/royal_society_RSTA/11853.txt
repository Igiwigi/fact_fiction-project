And this applies more forcibly to the lowest
line, the density 0°0456. On endeavouring to apply the thermodynamic equation to the line p = 0°180, it
appeared that it was less agreeable with the experiments. The reason of this is
probably to be found in the inapplicability of the formula to serve as the equation of
the gas at high pressures, It is, in fact, based upon ReGNavuut’s observations. Nor
