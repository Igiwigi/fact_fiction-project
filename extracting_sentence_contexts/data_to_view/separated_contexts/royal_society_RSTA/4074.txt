The nonlinear behaviour
is attributed to a combination of matrix microdamage and fibre splitting. The latter appears to
be a minor cause contributing less to the modulus versus strain variations. The stress-strain
response, as shown in figure 14a, exhibits a higher degree of linearity in the weft direction due
to the fact that loading occurs directly on the fibre tows situated in the outermost surface. The
warp direction shows more of a progression in failure of the material as shown in figure 14b and
deviations from linearity occur relatively early in the loading regime. However, due to the fact
that different fibre tows will have different stresses at the same externally applied displacement
indicates that the carbon may fail earlier than the glass and the failure envelope is progressive due
to the hybrid materials before two-piece failure.
