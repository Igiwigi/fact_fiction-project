But there are other forms of the additional assumption which are equally effective
and in some respects more general than that just given. We may, for instance, assume
definite expressions for the potential and kinetic energies of electromagnetic origin in
the system and combine these with the assumption that the dynamical processes
operative in the field are governed by the same general laws as are the processes in a
similar mechanical system. This form of the argument proves ultimately to be
consistent with the first as regards the expression for the effective mechanical force on
a moving element of charge, but it has the advantage of being expressed in more
general terms, thus carrying with it the possibility of fitting better with any modifi-
cation that it may subsequently be thought desirable to make in our general
conception of the theory. It need not be presumed that this form of the argument is
any less general than the first on account of the fact that it apparently involves more
than one assumption, for this increase in number is counterbalanced by the fact that
the dynamical argument ultimately reduces the two fundamental equations to one,
FarapbAy’s relation being derived simultaneously as a consequence of AMPERE’s.

The general dynamical argument was first formulated by Maxwe tf for the case
of the field surrounding a system of linear currents. His analysis was subsequently
extended to cover the moré general case, firstly by von Hetmuorrz{ and Lorentz,§
later by Larmor,|| Macponatp,{ ApraHam,** and others. In the later investigations
the whole subject is regarded from the point of view of the theory of electrons, where-
in every manifestation of the field is regarded as arising in the aggregate disposition
or motion of electronic charges; even in the former investigations, although they are
apparently of a more general character, certain assumptions are involved which render
