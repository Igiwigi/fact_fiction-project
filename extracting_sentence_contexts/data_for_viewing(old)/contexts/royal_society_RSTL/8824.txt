This peculiar configuration of the enamel-organ has relation to the partial disposition
of the enamel upon the tooth ; thus the tooth of the sharp-nosed eel (fig. 10) has a
sharp conical cap of enamel upon its sxummit, the enamel being absent, or s0 thin that I

cannot be sure of its existence, upon the sides of the tooth®*.

We may thus say that we have exemplified within the boundaries of a single tooth-
8c a functional and a rudimentary enamel-organ ; and it is interesting to observe that
the appearance of the rudimentary or lower portion of the enamelorgan closely
resembles that of the entire rudimentary enamel-organ of the armadillo, which I have
elsewhere described (Quart. Journ. Micros. Sci. 1874).

The fact that the development of the © enamel-cells ” bears a direct relation to the
thickness of the enamel to be formed also lends support to the view (which on other
grounds I am strongly inclined to support) that the enamel is formed by the direct con-
version of the enamel-cells into the hard tissue.

It is difficult otherwise to account for the contrast presented by the length of the
cells in the different parts of the enamel-organ ; and T may add that the aggregate
length of the cells and the enamel cap already formed in fig. 8 jus makes up the
thickness of the enamel cap upon an average completed tooth.

* The existence of terminal caps of enamel, a character upon which alone Professor Owrn has founded his
fossil genus © Ganacrodus,” is apparently by no means uncommon ; I have found them in the eel, the perch,
the newt, and the salamander; and as they are very easily lost in making sections, it is probable that they are
