It thus remains clearly proved that the passage of the electric current through a
mized nerve modifies the excitability of this nerve in a very different manner, accord-
ing to its direction : the nerve traversed by the direct current loses its excitability
much more rapidly than that which is traversed by the inverse current. T ought here
to add, that hitherto we have no experiment proving that a nerve snhjected to
the passage of the inverse current loses its excitability otherwise than it would
have done if merely left to itself. I return to the exposition of facts. Out of ten
frogs submitted to the experiment above described, frequently eight at least present
the following phenomenon :—On breaking the circait after the current has circulated
twenty-five or thirty minutes, the inverse limb alone contracts ; but this contraction
does not cease immediately after the eircuit is broken. The inverse limb continues
to be contracted, exhibits, that is to say, symnptoms of fefanus.
