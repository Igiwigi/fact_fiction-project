plants, and in all fairness, it is not hard to understand why.
To begin with, plants have no ‘nerves’ to speak of. Also,
‘neurobiology’ and ‘behaviour’ are words that are (until very
recently) invariably associated with animals. The situation
was further compounded when plant neurobiology enthu-
siasts began to use terms like ‘intelligence’, ‘mind’, ‘memory’,
‘cognition’ and ‘brain’, in the context of plant biology. The
debates about the use of these words as applied to plants
became as heated as scientific debates can be, and perhaps a
little more than that. Human emotions, though ostensibly not
actually running the scientific show, do strongly influence
the debate for sure. The arguments that the phrase ‘plant neu-
robiology’ helped initiate are perfect examples of this fact. Just
to give you a taste of how the discourse is taking place, on the
advocate’s side, there are published papers like ‘The mind of
plants: thinking the unthinkable’ [62] and ‘Plants learn and
remember: let’s get used to it.’ [63]. On the detractor’s side,
there are titles like ‘Plant neurobiology: no brain, no gain?’
[64] as well as the (rather unkind) ‘Plant neurobiology: intelli-
gent plants or stupid studies?’ [65]. Even in light of all the
disagreements that plant neurobiology as a field of study

triggers in its detractors, the undeniable reality is that plants
do display behaviour. They also seem to be able to display
phenomena very much like memory and learning, and without
