portion of waters attracted by the poxitive surface; at the/same
time that the other constituent part; the hydrogene is repelled
by-it; and the opposite process takes place at the negative -$ur-
face ; and in the middle or neutral point of the circuit, whether
there be a series of decompositions and recompositions, or
whether'the particles from the extreme points only are active,
there must be anew combination of the repelled matter : and
the case is analogous to'that of two,portions of muriate-of soda
Separated by. distilled water ; muviatic acid is repelled from the
negative side, and -soda from the positive/side, ahd mubiate of
Soda is composed in the middle yessel.

These facts seem fully to invalidate the \conjectures of M.
RiTtTER, and 'some other philosophers, with regard to the
elementary nature -of water, and perfectly to confirm the
great discovery of Mr. CAVENDISH.

M. RiTTER conceived that he had procured oxygene from
water without hydrogene, by making sulphuric acid the me-
dium of communication at the negative surface;-butin this case,
