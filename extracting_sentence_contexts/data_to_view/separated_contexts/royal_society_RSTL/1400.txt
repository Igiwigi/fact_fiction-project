I may further add, - that SPaLLanzant's experiments of
diffusing the luminous liquor of the medusa in water, milk,
and other fluids, are in direct contradiction of his own theory,
as is also the extinction of the Jight of these mixtures by the
application of a high degree of heat. If the light emitted by animals were derived from their
food, or the air they respire, as supposed by CarRraporr, the
phenomenon should be increased or diminished, according to
the quantity of food or air, that the creatures consume ; but
we do not find this to be the case; for in those situations
where they are sometimes found to be most luminous, they
are deprived, in a great measure, of these assumed sources of
their light. In fact, the luminous exhibitions of living animals are not
only independent of all foreign light, but are frequently des-
troyed by the latter. I have always found the shining of the
medusz to cease upon the rising of the moon, or at the ap-
proach of day ; and when out of the sea, I never could excite
them to throw out light until they had been kept for some time
in the dark ; all the luminous insects likewise secrete them-
selves as much as possible during the day time, and go abroad
only at night. I have, it is true, found that the scolopendra
electrica will not shine unless it has been previously exposed
to solar light; but I have observed that it shone as brilliantly
_ and as frequently, after being kept a short time in a light
