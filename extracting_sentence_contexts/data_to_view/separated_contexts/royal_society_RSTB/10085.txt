A star represents difference significant at p < .05,
FWER corrected, two-tailed. (ii) DA response to positive (green trace, N = 238) and negative (red trace, N = 216) RPEs with BET greater than or equal to 0.9. A star
fepresents difference significant at p < .05, FWER corrected, two-tailed.

coordinates with radius 5 mm and sampled into the space of the (n) BOLD analysis
functional images. These coordinates were the peak-activation
coordinates in L/R caudate, L/R ventral striatum/putamen for
fictive error and RPE from [25]. A time series was formed for
each ROI by averaging the functional images over this mask. Subjects were selected sequentially and assigned an ROI so
that the proportions of the four ROIs represented were the
same as in the DA subjects (see the electronic supplementary
material).
