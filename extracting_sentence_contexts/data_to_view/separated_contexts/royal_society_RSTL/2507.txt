Occasionally, at the admitted limit hours of the diurnal oscil-
lations of the barometer, I made a few observations ; but they were of little further
value than to show that the maxima and minima, on consecutive days, did not occur
at the same exact period of time. In 1830, however, with two of ExcLerieLD's baro-
meters, which admitted of the adjustment of the lower level of the mercury to the
1000th of an inch, I made obseryations every quarter of an hour, and sometimes every
five minutes, during the whole of the year at the limit hours of the diurnal maximum
and minimum A.M. and P.M. and maximum P.M. tides, Messrs. WALKER and Jervis
had in use G1LBeRT's barometers, and did not obserye for the exact limit hours. Messrs. BovsscauLT and Rivero, in addressing HumBoLpT from South America,
state that their labours had verified the fact established by HumBorpr, that the mer-
cury between the tropics attains its maximum between 8 and 10 a.m., then descends
till near 4 y.., and is at the minimum between 3 and 5 p.m. : then it ascends till 11
at night, without reaching however the same height at which it was at 9 in the morn-
ing, and finally re-descends till 4 in the morning. It will be seen how closely these
limit hours hold good in Dukhun as well as in America ; and Mr. Hupsox has de-
termined that they hold good in London : but I have on record instances of the
barometer rising until 10> 45> a.m., falling until 6 y.w., and rising until 12 at night;
but the instances are rare: and even the tremendous storms preceding and closing
the monsoons in India only modify and do not interrupt the tides*. HumBorLpr ob-
serves, that in Macao, in 1814, there were frequent tempests, and twenty-six stormy
days, and yet there was not a single instance of the tides being interverted.
