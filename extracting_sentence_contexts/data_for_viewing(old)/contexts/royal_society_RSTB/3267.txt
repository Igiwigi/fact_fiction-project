higher than on the previous day. No positive pressure was shown by any branch, the
positive pressures in the table being merely the starting pressures of the manometers.

These results conclusively show that no continuous network of water columns
existed in this poplar tree at a time when transpiration was active, although
different results might be obtained when all the vessels were completely filled with
water and transpiration reduced to a minimum. In fact, CLaRK* states that when
manometers are attached to the Maple in spring the formation of each new boring
causes the pressure to fall temporarily to zero in widely distant manometers. Such a
condition is, however, of very rare occurrence, and probably never occurs in any plant
when transpiration is active.
