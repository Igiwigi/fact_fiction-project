When we take into conside-
ration all these sources of error, the numerous instances of perfect agreement with,
as contrasted with the few examples of slight deviation from, the general law of the
heat of sabstitution being equal for the same bases, appear to be sufficient fully to
establish its accuracy. It may be here observed that the accuracy of this principle will not be in any way
affected whatever views may be adopted, as to the exact changes which occur when
one Ã¾base displaces another. Whether we consider the final result to arise from the
simple substitution of one base into the position occupied by another, or from a series
of distinct chemical changes, each producing a certain thermal effect, the general
facts now established will not be the less rigorously true. The separation of most, of the bases in a solid form, will of course tend to produce
heat, and as this will vary with different precipitates, the numbers for the insoluble
bases cannot be exactly compared with one another. The amount of the latent heat
due to precipitation is unknown, but it must be the same whenever the same preci-
pitate is formed, The correction for this cause will, therefore, be a constant quantity
for the salts of the same base, and if applied, could not affect the equality of the
foregoing groups of numbers.
