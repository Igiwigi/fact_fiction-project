apparently composed entirely of basalts with the exception of that area immediately
south of the fault which truncates the southern end of Lorienatom. There one finds a
porphyritic-felspar basalt overlying rhyolites, the whole series dipping W. 20째 N. at
10-20째. This rhyolite had not the appearance of a dyke, but its field relationships were

somewhat obscured and it is probable that this is what it was, for otherwise one has the
locally anomalous position of the basalts being younger than the rhyolites.

At the old administrative post of Kakalai just west of Kangmanang the river has cut
into porphyritic-felspar basalts revealing the fact that they and the interbedded tuffs
are cut by numerous small reversed faults. The photograph (fig. 21, Plate 27) was
taken looking south-east. It therefore seems that if the flexions and faults have the
normal strike found in the area, i.e. about 15째 E. of N., then they are really even more
pronounced than is shown in the observed section where the hade of the faults appears
to be 30째. The nature of these faults and the associated flexures seems to indicate that
the region has been subjected to pressure acting in an east-west direction.

Just to the east of Kakalai lies Kangmanang (Conical Hill), which is shown by
Arambourg as having a capping of rhyolites. It is abruptly truncated on its eastern
side by a fault scarp, and from a distance it seems that the main mass of the hill, like
the surrounding country, is made up of basalts.
