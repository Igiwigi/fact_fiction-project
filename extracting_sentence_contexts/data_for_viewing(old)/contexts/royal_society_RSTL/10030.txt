Upon the view put forth above that a series of 8ubstances are formed between the
muscle protoplasm and the final explosive substance, it follows that the chemical
combinations which are formed in the lower part of this series possess less explosive

energy, are less excitable, and less compact than the combinations which oceur in the
higher part of the series. Finally, I cannot help being struck with the fact that
alkaline substances snch as sodium hydrate or sodium carbonate increase the execita-
bility, increase the tonicity and increase the force of the contractions in weakly- -beating
hearts ; while, on the other hand, such 8nbstances as lactic acid diminish the excitability,
diminish the tonicity and diminish the force of the contractions of the cardiac musde.
Whether the resemblance in these two cases is purely fictitious, or whether the trophic
action of the vagus nerve is connected with some such action of acids and alkalies I
cannob 8ay, and only put forward the resemblance in the hope that a possible clue
nay thus be ſound to the chemical action of the vagus upon the musecular s8ubstance of
Stthe heart.
