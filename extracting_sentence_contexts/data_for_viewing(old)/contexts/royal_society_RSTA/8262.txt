* Formerly I estimated 9 =1, Actual solution of the equation for @ shows it to be much less than
unity. In my previous analysis of the BaLMer maximum I found x= 7. In the present analysis I
take g 2-5 times larger, Py comes out 5 times larger owing to 0 = 0-2, and I take + about 1 times larger,
giving a total factor 21 times larger. Hence xy = 148.

is that the decreased ionization consequent on increased pressure may be more than
compensated by the increased ionization consequent on increased temperature, so that
on balance the temperature of maximum may be decreased and not increased, as
observed. Mathematical analysis confirms Miss PAYNE’s conjecture. We have in fact
an interesting application of the solution to ScuwarzscutLp’s problem.

The temperature of maximum is determined by the equation Py) = [ K,], where
6 varies only slowly with T,,,,. and K, varies principally through its exponential factor
containing T,,,.. What we actually observe is not, however, Tax, but (Ty)max., Where

(Tinax.)* = 3 (Trimax. (1 + 3 7);

and 7 is related to Py by an equation already given. Ignoring slowly varying factors,
we have in principle
