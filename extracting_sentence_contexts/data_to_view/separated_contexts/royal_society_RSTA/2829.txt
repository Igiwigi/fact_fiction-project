Hyperthermals have been identified as killers during many Phanerozoic events, especially
from the Permian, Mesozoic and Palaeogene. It is important, however, to consider each event
in the context of longer-term conditions. The fact that the Permian-Triassic was already a
hothouse world may have been significant. In fact, the PTME events exacerbated certain long-
term processes, as noted, including increasing temperatures, increasing aridification and reducing
atmospheric oxygen throughout the Permian, and continuing into the Triassic [16]. When
hyperthermals strike during ice-house conditions, the effects and impacts on life might be
different.
