Z of the given functions being multiplied by an appropriate other function of a given
b= degree i in z, the sum of the two products will express a corresponding residue. These

accordingly, with the exception of one arbitrary factor which enters into the solution,
the problem'is definite; and if it be farther agreed that the quantities entering into

F'and's, and also of the lowest nitmerical denomination, then the problem (save as to
the algebraical 8ign' of plus or minus) becomes absolutely determinate, and we can
