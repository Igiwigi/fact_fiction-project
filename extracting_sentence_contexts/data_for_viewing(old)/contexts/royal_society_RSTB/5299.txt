by way of the lymphatics (see below).

If there were a connection between the “ fine ”’ vessels and the veins, the close resem-
blance of the former to arteries would suggest that it would be of a capillary nature.
Double injections show clearly that there is no such connection, although the terminal
capillaries of the two systems are in close contact with one another (Plate 86, fig. 14).
From this preparation it is clear that the black injection introduced into the “fine”
vessels has penetrated into Kepillary network of relatively capacious vessels, which is
entirely separate from the more minute terminal capillary branches of the veins (white).

It may therefore safely be asserted that the “fine ’’ vessels do not pass into the
veins through a common capillary network as they should do were they functionally part
of the general arterial system. In fact, from a considerable number of injections both
single and double, I am confident that there is no direct connection between the “ fine ”
vessels and the veins, a conclusion to which I also came from the work I did on Lophius.

Relations between the “ fine”? vessels and the blood vascular system: arteries.—As I
have already pointed out there is every reason to consider that the “ fine ” vessels are

morphologically very closely related to the arterial system. This relationship is evident
in their structure and contents, as previously noted in Lophius (4, p. 41) and the
