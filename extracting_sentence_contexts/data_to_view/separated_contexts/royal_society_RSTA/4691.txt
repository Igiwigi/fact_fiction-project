The latter is the case for streets going around the inner
circle, i.e. the azimuthal component of the velocity appears faster than in figure 1a. Likewise, the
radial component of the velocity appears slower than in figure 1a. So far, everything has been fictitious in that no car in the city is actually driving faster than in
figure 1a. Here comes the trick: we turn the apparent velocity of cars on the computer screen into
an actual velocity distribution in the city. To do so, we have to ignore the fixed grid of streets and
rather consider an open area.
