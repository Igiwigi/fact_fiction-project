This combination of dimensions, Length? x Mass/Time, is called ‘action’ 3
and is the dimension of the Planck constant. Therefore what the Planck constant fixes is the size :
of a (tiny) region in the space of the possible values that the variables of any system can take. nee)

Now, the major physical characterization of quantum theory is that the volume of the region R :
where the system happens to be cannot be smaller that 27h: [4

Vol(R) = 27h, Q1) 38

per each degree of freedom. This is the most general and most important physical fact at the core a)
of quantum theory. This implies that the number of possible values that any variable distinguishing points within
the region R of phase space, and which can be determined without altering the fact that the system
is in the region R itself, is at most
Ne Vol(R)
~ 2nh

(2.2)

which is a finite number. That is, this variable can take discrete values only.
