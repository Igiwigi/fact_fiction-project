evaporation will be greatest on that ball which is nearest to the lamp; therefore this
ball will be driven away until the force on the other becomes equal, after which the
balls will come to rest, unless momentum carries them further. On the other hand,
when a piece of ice is brought near, the temperature of the pith will be reduced, and it
will condense the vapour and be drawn towards the ice.‚Äù

It is not my intention to recapitulate the arguments I have already brought forward
against these three explanations. They are all fully given in my above-quoted lecture
before the Physical Society. I hall, however, adduce a few experiments which have
been devised specially with the view of putting one or other of these theories to the
test. In giving what I conceive to be reasonable arguments against the explanations
which have already been proposed, I do not, however, wish to insist upon any theory
of my own to take their place. Any theory will account for s0me facts ; but only the
true explanation will eatisfy al/ the conditions of the problem, and this cannot be said
of either of the theories I have already discussed.

118. The pendulum-apparatus, described and figured in paragraph 99, was specially
devised to bear upon the air-current and the electrical theory. On referring to the
description of the experiments tried with it (Tables I. & IT.), it is seen that in air the
ignited spiral produced attraction, whilst in a vacuum the same source of radiation gave
