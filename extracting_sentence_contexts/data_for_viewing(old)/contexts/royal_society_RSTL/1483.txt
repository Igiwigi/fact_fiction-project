of exactness.

Before we can enter into particulars, it will be necessary to
give the series of observations upon which my computations
have been founded. It is not sufficient to extract only those
parts of them which have served for calculating the period ;
as the value of astronomical observations consists in having
them entire ; every circumstance, as it occurred, is of conse-

quence, and facts being stubborn things, we cannot decide
upon them properly till they have been entirely laid open to
our view, and sufficiently scrutinized. For this purpose the
observations are all extracted from the journal, in the regular
order in which they were made; and here I must remark, that
I purposely avoided any calculations, or even surmises, of the
length of a rotation, while the observations were making ; in
order to be perfectly free from every bias that might mislead
the eye. In this I succeeded 5so well, that, when I began to
calculate, I mistook not less than 4 hours and + in the first
8upposition I made; which, happening to agree extraordinarily
well with four of the most pointed observations, it misled me
so far, that I was very near rejecting the whole series as in-
