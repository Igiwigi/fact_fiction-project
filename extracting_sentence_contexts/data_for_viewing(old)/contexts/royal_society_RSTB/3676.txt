on in the gut still remains to be gone through in the salivary glands. Before,
however, leaving the gut cycle it is necessary to consider two very important points :
(a) The meaning of certain curious multiple and non-flagellate forms found in the
gut from about the 5th to the 12th day; and (b) the question as to whether
conjugation has taken place at any period in the gut cycle just sketched.

(a) In live preparations of the gut there may occasionally be seen confused motile
forms with several flagella; others are somewhat amoeboid, and the flagella are
more or less adherent to the protoplasm; others have no flagella at all, and are
quiescent ; and still others are obviously wriggling masses of half-fused trypanosomes.
Figs. 21-24 give some of these forms as they appear in stained preparations. They
always lie right up against the peritrophic membrane. Now, there is little doubt from
the fact that these forms can be seen in live films to be caused by the fusion of soft,
rather unhealthy-looking trypanosomes under the unfavourable condition obtaining
on the slide, that many of these appearances are cases of degeneration. Nevertheless,
this is no proof that all the multiple individuals are degeneration products, to be
dismissed without further consideration, I have not been able to get any evidence
that the multiple forms play any progressive or essential part whatsoever in the
cycle. They must, however, always be borne in mind, as these appearances may
afford an unfortunate mask, obscuring the process of conjugation. Sometimes in live
films from the early days in the fly cycle, and occasionally also on films from the
monkey when these were prepared with a little water or with a 0Â°50-per-cent. salt
solution, trypanosomes were observed to come together from opposite sides in pairs
so as to overlap about one-third of the body length as in fig. 39a, which is from
a freehand sketch of live individuals. The junction seems superficially to be
