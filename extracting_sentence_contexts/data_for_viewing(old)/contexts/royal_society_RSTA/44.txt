differences between the results in the functional and MNI spaces. Specifically, in figure 5a,c, it
can be seen that the time-varying DMN degree follows the time-varying HR and PETCO2 power,
respectively. On the other hand, in figure 5b,d, the same relation is not as clear, which is reflected
on the obtained correlation coefficients (table 1).

In figure 5, we also present results obtained when using the wavelet transform, for the
frequency sub-bands within which the correlation between time-varying network degree and
band-limited signal power was found to be highest. In both functional and MNI spaces, the A4
level (0-0.25 Hz) yielded the highest correlations for the HR signal, whereas for the PETCO2
signal, the A2 level (0-0.08 Hz) yielded the highest correlations in the functional space, owing
to that resting PETCO) fluctuations exhibit most of their power below 0.05 Hz [32]. In the MNI
space, level A4 (0-0.02 Hz) yielded the stronger correlations for the PETCO) signal, possibly due
to the fact that registration of the BOLD time series to the MNI space essentially results in low pass
filtering. Overall, the correlations between time-varying degree and signal power were found to
be stronger for the time-varying band-limited power compared with total signal power (see also
tables 1 and 2).

The correlation coefficient values between time-varying DMN degree and the total/band-
limited power of the PETCO? and HR signals are given in table 1 for all subjects (mean + s.d.).
