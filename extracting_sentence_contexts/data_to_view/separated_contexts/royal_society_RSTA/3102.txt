According to § 7 the cross-section of the jet increases about 1 per cent. for every
10 cm, the pressure decreases. The cross-section ought, then, to be measured at mean
pressure, but is in fact determined at the commencement of the experiment. If the
liquid pressure has diminished h cm. during the experiment, the mean cross-section is

h
2000’

where A is the measured cross-section.
