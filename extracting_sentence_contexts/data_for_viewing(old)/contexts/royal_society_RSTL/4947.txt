the moment of deposition, or even during the first few minutes after submersion,
and before it has become expanded by imbibition of fluid ; although it may be removed
without much difficulty from the egg of the Newt, the yelk of which, in the vitelline
membrane, lies free and unattached in its interior. But some time after the expan-
sion has taken plac2 I have myself found that the frog's egg may be deprived of
a large portion of this covering, and yet produce an embryo equally well as if it
had remained protected. On the other hand, one most important function of this
investment seems to be indicated in the following facts. SPALLaNzani found that
ova of-the Frog deprived of their envelopes before contact with the male influence,
were not impregnated ; and further, that ova taken directly from the ovaria, are not
susceptible of impregnation.

A remarkable fact which I noticed, at a time when I was not fully aware of its
interest and importance, enables me to confirm this observation. I captured a pair
of frogs, the female of which, a short time after they were in my possession, had a
large hernia formed by a protrusion of part of the great oviduct through an acci-
dental wound in the posterior part of the right side of the body, and in consequence
of which she was unable to deposit her ova. This wound had been received before
the union of the sexes, but the hernia was formed afterwards, during the passing of
the ova from the ovaria. The result of this was, that when some of the ova had
passed into that part of the duct which protruded through the wound, the sac formed
by it was constricted, and became 80 enlarged by the expansion of the egg-envelopes,
that the remainder of the ova were prevented from entering it. On opening the ab-
domen of the frog after death, I found that a very large proportion of the ova which
had left the ovarium on that side of the body, were lying in the cavity of the perito-
