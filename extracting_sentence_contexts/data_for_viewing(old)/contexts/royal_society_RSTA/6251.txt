7). The main feature distinguishing Cluster 2 from Cluster 3 in terms of probabilities p; of non-
zero counts is that on most days Cluster 2, unlike Cluster 3, discusses COVID-19 also in personal
chats (question j = 6).

Figures 5 and 6 display the main characteristics of the inner clusters. We are interested in the
posterior distribution of the number of the inner clusters per outer cluster, as well as the inner
clustering within each outer cluster. To this end, we run the MCMC algorithm fixing the outer
cluster allocation to its Binder estimate, thus obtaining the conditional posterior distribution of the
inner clustering. The results reveal substantial variability in the distribution of non-zero counts
within outer Clusters 1 and 2 (see figure 5c). The majority of counts in outer Cluster 1 are zero,
leaving little variation in the counts for the inner clustering. As most individuals present zero
counts (for most processes) at an inner cluster level, it becomes difficult to detect specific patterns
as it is also evident from the fact that many co-clustering probabilities are in the range 0.3-0.6
