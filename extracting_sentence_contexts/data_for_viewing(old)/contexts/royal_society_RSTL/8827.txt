To confine the discussion for the present to the Elasmobranch Fishes, Professor Owrx,
as shown in the above quotation, holds that their teeth stop 'short at a © papillary ”
stage equivalent to that supposed by him to exist at an early stage of the formation of
a human tooth ; while against this we haye the opinion of Professor HuxLey, that © the
process seems to correspond with something more than the first and transitory papillary
stage of the development of the mammalian teeth.”

The application of modern methods of microscopic research has rendered it possible
to obtain sections showing the relation of the various structures over a far larger area
than was formerly practicable ; and the facts thus brought to light appear to me to be
of snfficient interest to merit careful description, although in many of the essential
points T have been anticipated by Professor HuxLey, as is shown by the extract here
8ubjoined.

* In the Skate, as is well known, the young teeth are developed in longitudinal rows
within a deep fold of the mucons membrane of the mouth, behind the jaw. $o far as
my examinations go, however, I find that this is not a mere simple fold, such as it has
been described to be, but its two walls behave just in the same manner as those of the
primitive dental groove in man—that is, they become closely united in lines perpendi-
cular to the direction of the jaw, s0 that partitions are formed between every two rows
of teeth ; transverse partitions again stretch between the separate teeth of each row, but
these did not appear to me to be complete, terminating by an arcuated border below.
