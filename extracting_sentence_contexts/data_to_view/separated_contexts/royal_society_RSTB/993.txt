On the Specific Gravity of the Venous Blood-plasma.

ne ett. which have been made in Sub-section 4, as to the difference
he effect of an increase of the venous pressure in a limb upon the venous
it limb, and the venous blood in other parts, also holds good in the case of
blood-plasma ; the venous blood-plasma of the system, as a whole, remains
in specific gravity, that of the obstructed limb rises in some. cases as much

s rise in specific gravity of the plasma of venous blood proves that the watery
» plasma has been chiefly removed during the passage through the limb.
1s in the normal state, so that the blood does not lose plasma as such during
from an artery to a vein, but something less than plasma. At the first
rise suggests that, since water has left the plasma, the limb must have become
s. Such, however, is not necessarily the case, and, in fact, the constancy of

in other parts of the body shows that the total amount that left the
the supply of the needs of the tissue was not excessive though each volume

os a larger quantity of water than an equal volume in any other part where
darn was shorter.*

, therefore, that the effect of increase of venous pressure in a limb for one
raise the specific gravity of the venous blood-plasma in the limb itself, but as
venous blood-plasma of other parts is concerned, it is without effect.

6. On the Specific Gravity of Voluntary Muscle. Hpuch as any fluid which passes out of the blood vessels must present itself, at
& for a time, in the muscles as part of the tissues surrounding the blood-vessels,
p was sought here as to the effect of venous pressure in a limb.
