Presupposition: Sanihas-smoked. Furthermore, we can demonstrate that the disappointment
meaning and factive meaning carried by regret reside on differ-
ent levels of meaning. Ifa speaker asks a yes/no question of (51),
as in (53), the speaker is asking about Sam’s disappointment,
not about the underlying fact of his smoking. Similarly, if the
speaker negates (51), as in (54), they are negating Sam’s disap-
pointment, not the underlying fact of his smoking. Also,
attempts to carry on the discourse by directly addressing the
factive meaning are considered unacceptable to speakers.
