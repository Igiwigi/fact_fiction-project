120 DR. A. D. IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS.

Near the apex of each testis lobe are groups of spermatogonia, and a little lower
down, one meets with compact masses of spermatocytes (primary and secondary) in
various phases of nuclear division. At the bases of each lobe, spermatids are evident
in large numbers; these cells are usually of rounded or slightly ameeboid
form. No mature spermatozoa were present in the vesicule seminales or vasa
deferentia. Although I have not had the opportunity of following the process of
spermatogenesis in any detail, an examination of thin sections, stained with iron-alum
hematoxylin, failed to reveal any indications of degeneration associated therewith.
I am, therefore, led to the conclusion, which is supported by other facts, that the
testes of the soldier are functional organs.

(b) The Winged Male.—In the fully chitinised winged male, the reproductive
system resembles that of the soldier so closely that any detailed description or figures
appear to be unnecessary. The testes are much enveloped in fat-body, and are con-
sequently rather difficult to detect ; on an average each testis measures 0°48-0°5 mm.
long and 0°32-0'4 mm. wide. The vas deferens is a slender duct varying in length
from about 0°8 to 1'°2 mm. ; the vesicule seminales did not contain any spermatozoa,
and form compact tubular glands measuring about 0°7 x 0°6 mm.

(c) The Nymphs.—The reproductive organs differ in no noticeable degree from
those of the winged males,
