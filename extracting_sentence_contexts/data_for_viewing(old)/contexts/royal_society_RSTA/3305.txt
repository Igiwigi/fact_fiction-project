The smallest cluster capable of forming cyclic structures is C3. Its well-known Almy-X 13g
emission spectrum was first recorded by Huggins in 1881, while investigating unknown cometary
emission features near 24675.6cm~! [3]. These so-called Swings emission bands [1] were first
reproduced in the laboratory by Herzberg [77]. Although the emitter was initially thought to
be CHp [77], the unambiguous assignment to linear C3 is due to Douglas [78] and Gausset
et al. [79,80], who performed spectroscopic investigations on discharges through !°C-substituted
methane and flash photolysis of diazomethane, respectively. From the high-resolution spectra,
Gausset et al. first emphasized the unusual low bending frequency of 1-C3(X1 EE ) with v2
63cm! as well as the strong RT vibronic interactions of the excited 1-C3(A!/7y). Such features are
responsible for the observed intricate vibrational spectrum [79,80]. Several gas-phase and matrix
studies of C3 have subsequently been devoted to its spectroscopic characterization, resulting in
the assignment of the most ground and upper state vibrational frequencies of the A!/7,-X! ze
band [81-85] and the discovery of a low-lying triplet electronic state manifold [86-88]. In fact, the
carbon trimer is perhaps one of the best characterized non-rigid triatomics in existence [2,89].

Cz has been observed in a wide range of astrophysical sources [90,91], including circumstellar
shells of carbon stars [4,92,93], interstellar molecular clouds [7,94-96] and comets [3,92]. Its mid-
IR spectrum (v3 antisymmetric stretching mode) was measured in the circumstellar envelope of
the C-rich star IRC+10216 by Hinkle et al. [4], and the far-IR one (vz) detected in the direction
of Sgr B2 by Cernicharo eft al. [92]. The abundance of C3 were determined in translucent clouds
by Maier et al. [95], Roueff et al. [96] and Oka et al. [90] through its Swings’ electronic transition.
As the most abundant small pure carbon molecule in the interstellar medium, C3 along with C2
are key to the formation of more complex carbon clusters, long-chain cyanopolyynes, carbon dust
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [1,2]. In addition to its astrophysical importance, it is the
predominant carbon cluster in equilibrium hot carbon vapour [2,42,44], hydrocarbon flames [1,2]
