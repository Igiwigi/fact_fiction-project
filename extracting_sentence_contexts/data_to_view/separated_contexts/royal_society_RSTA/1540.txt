: Whether & (x) be odd or even, the integral is necessarily an even function of y, for
it is unchanged when the sign of y is changed. In fact, for any ¢ (a) the integral

Fy)=[ ¥@)K(eyde

is necessarily even in y. Any number of solutions can be found as follows, involving both odd and even
functions of y :—

Let F, («) be any odd function of x giving a finite integral

where G, is even in y—and therefore over a wide range of forms of G, expressible as
a Neumann series—and a solution of the homogeneous equation
