Attention was called to the possibility that autumn rainfall was an important factor
in determining the wheat crop by Sir Naprer Suaw in 1905 (14). Suaw did not use the
method of correlation, but pointed out that in the twenty years 1885-1904, with two
exceptions, when the yield for Eastern England was above the average the previous
autumn rainfall was below the average and vice versa. In this set of 20 pairs of values
the correlation is actually — 0-629, a value which would only be exceeded by wncorre-
lated variates in 3 samples of 20 out of athousand. The particular meteorological variate.
autumn rainfall, was picked out of a table giving at least 36 meteorological quantities.
and the chance that all of these, if independent and in reality uncorrelated with the crop,
should give correlations between + 0-629, was therefore about 0-89. Such a system
would therefore be expected to yield so high a correlation only once in 9 trials, and the
fact that such a correlation occurred supplied some presumption that autumn rainfall
had in reality a perceptible influence on the crop.

In discussing the significance of this result SHaw (14, pp. 318-319) made the inter-
esting suggestion that the association observed might not be due wholly to the effects
of autumn weather, but possibly to dry autumns being frequently followed by a favourable
succession of weather in Spring and Summer.

“ He would like to say a word with respect of Mr. THomas’s suggestion that the
autumn rainfall was not the dominant factor in determining the subsequent yield
of wheat. What surprised him were not the exceptions, but the agreements.
Remembering that nine months had to run between the end of autumn and the
beginning of harvest, and considering the influence of the intervening rainfall. sun-
