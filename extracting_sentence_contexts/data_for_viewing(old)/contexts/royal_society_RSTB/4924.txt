GENERAL Discussion or ReEsutrts.

The above observations and experiments show that the silver fir Chermes causes
serious injury to the young tree, and it is especially during the first 15-20 years of its
life that the evil effects of the insectsâ€™ attack are most pronounced. This injury is
directly attributable to the interference with the normal conduction of water and
dissolved substances in the stem, in consequence of the partial replacement of the
xylem elements by abnormal parenchymatous cells, incapable of carrying out this
function satisfactorily. As a direct result of the reduced water supply to the terminal
portions of the shoots (7.e., in those regions below which abnormal tissue has been
developed), gradual withering of these, together with defoliation, is to be anticipated,
and this is precisely what is found in the case of heavily infested trees under natural
conditions. A second source of injury to the plant no doubt arises from the fact that
food substances are continually being removed from it by the insect, but this, in my
opinion, is probably the less important factor of the two, the inadequate supply of
water being the primary cause of injury.

The commencement of the attack at an early stage in the differentiation of the tissues
of the stem, before the first xylem and phloem have been laid down, is an important
point, as the normal development of the xylem in the young shoots is interfered with
in its inception, with a consequent initial handicap to all the young growth. This, as
time goes on, is gradually increased by the attacks of succeeding generations of stem-
feeding forms.

How numerous these Chermes can become in the case of D. niisslini, may be seen in
