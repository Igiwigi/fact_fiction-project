leaf-bases revealed all the stages, hitherto
unknown, in the leaf-trace sequence, while
the outermost petioles were identical in
structure with those of the type-specimen,
leaving no doubt whatever of a specific
identity. Between the petioles were nu-
merous adventitious roots. also previously
unknown.

While this improved acquaintance with
one of the first-known Zygopterids is
welcome in itself, the facts now brought
to light are of a very unexpected nature.
For, as I have ascertained beyond doubt.
