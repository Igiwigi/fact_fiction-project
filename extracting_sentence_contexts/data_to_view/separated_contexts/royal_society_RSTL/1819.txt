That successive arrivals of migrating birds are attributable
to the progressive developement of the generative system in
the male and female : that progressive developements are
wise provisions of nature ; that premature arrivals and de-
partures are frequently to be accounted for on tbe same
principle ; that the departure of the spring migrators is owing
to a change in the testes and ovaria, the very opposite to that
which took place in the spring ; that the departure of the
young birds is not guided by the parent, but the result of an
unknown principle. In the second part of this paper, some observations are
made on the winter birds of passage ; that they quit their

homes (this country) in spring, in quest of a country better
suited to their intended purpose than their own ; that they
are actuated by the same impulse in quitting this country, that
causes the spring birds to come to it, and that want of food
cannot be the inducement ; that the emigration of the winter
birds is less complete than that of the others (the spring mi-
grators) ; that some species breed here, especially the wild-
duck and wood-pigeon ; that the redwings and fieldfares are
the most regular and uniform in their appearance and disap-
pearance, and most probably never risk the trial of incubation
here ;* that they quit the country temporarily in severe and
long continued frost through want of food, and return to it
again at the approach of more temperate weather ; that the
arrival of water-birds forebodes the approach of intense frost,
the usual return of the winter-birds, a thaw ; that examina-
tions of the latter prove them to have taken long flights be-
fore their return, and sets the fact of temporary migration
beyond the reach of doubt. I have then made a digression, and introduced some obser-
vations on the singing of birds ; and in a third part, given
some additional particulars respecting the different sizes of
the generative organs of birds, as they appear at different
seasons of the year.
