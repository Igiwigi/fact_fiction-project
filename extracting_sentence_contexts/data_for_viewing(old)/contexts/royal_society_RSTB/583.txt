but Watiacer’s line is a broad one on a small scale map, and, though I have a
particular acquaintance with the geography here, and know the precise spot where
the plant was collected, I often cannot tabulate it ; I cannot say as to 1 Himalayan
plant specimen in 20, whether it was collected in WaxLAce Region I. or in WaLLAcE
Region III. There exists, no doubt, an unusually strongly marked natural line
between the high level Himalayan flora with Firs, Oaks, and Blackberries, and the
Indo-Malay tropical flora. I could assume as to many a Himalayan plant that in
character it was European, and tabulate it in Region I. accordingly. Each tabulation
of a specimen made in this manner will be illusory; the thing to be proved is
assumed, and we are in a complete circle; tabulators have, however, sometimes
allocated specimens in this way, and such additions only serve to mask the conclusions
that could have been drawn from the resulting numbers had they been omitted. But
further, this way of tabulating causes some of the most striking facts of geographic
distribution to disappear. I may have, for instance, a Himalayan pine to tabulate,
and, as I do not know exactly which side of Watace’s line it comes from, I place it
in Region I. But it perhaps was a specimen of Pinus longifolia from the tropical
zone. Or I may find a Bengal specimen of the common stag’s-horn moss, which we
have to go to the mountains of Scotland or of Wales to find; and, regarding this as
an alpine plant, I might refer it @ priori to Region I., whereas this identical series is
abundant in the subtropical zone in Bengal. |

This work of tabulating must not be done from @ priori assumptions of what the
results will be. Mr. Waxtace has not made this error ; his map at the beginning of
his book is really the result attained by all his work in the book ; in all this work,
before he had made his map, he referred the Mammalia to ordinary geographic areas
