From
the experimental side also, as will be seen, these differences are further brought out. Part I[].—Resvutts oF ABSINTHE STIMULATION. Having, in Parts I. and II., had the opportunity of briefly comparing the facts of the
functional and anatomical changes which result from a series of ablations of cerebral
