figure. It is yet more perfect than Mr. CarruTHERs' specimen, since its lower
extremity, a, exhibits much more markedly than his corresponding ones do the
elongated foliar cicatrices characteristic of the Lepidodendra. At the lower portion of
the branch, A, these leaf-scars have exactly the same form as those of LT. selaginoides
and L. elegans of LixDLEY and HuTron. After its first bifurcation, the two branches, |
B, B, till retain much of their Lepidodendroid features, though the leaf-scars
gradually become less elongated vertically. Towards the upper part of each of the |
branches, B, B, we discover the first traces of the tubercles characteristic of Halonia.
These become yet more conspicuous and numerous in the terminal branches, Q, Q,
where we also find that the foliar cicatrices are equilateral rhomboids, instead of the
vertically elongated scars seen at A; their vertical and transverse diameters being
now about equal. The difference between the two forms is shown to be due in this
instance, not only to differences between the several cortical layers, but to the fact that
these branches, like their parent stems, have grown more in length than in breadth,
This is proven by the circumstance that we can trace the gradations from the one
form to the other in the game continuous cortical surface. These Halonioid branches
are obviously identical with the Zalona tortuoss of LINDLEY and HUTTON.

* See memoir, Part II., p. 222, Phil. Trans., 1872. In the work referred to above, M. REexAVLY
endeavours to draw a distinetion between Halonic, which he believes to be the subterranean rhizomes, -
and those which he recognizes as branches of Lepidodendron. He includes in the former class, which
he thinks differs from his second one in the rarity with which dichotomous branching occurs in the
Halonice belonging to it, the well-known Halonia regularis. This distinetion is a purely imaginary
one. Halonia regularis dichotomises freely.â€”July 7th, 1883.
