If we take the means of the vertical columns, they are, in hundredths of feet,

'These are very nearly as the differences of the parallax. We shall find that the for-
mula 1:7 (p — P) when p is the parallax, and P is 57', will yery nearly giye this re-
sult. It gives, in fact,

—=31 —34 =17 oO +17 +34 +51 +68

Hence, applying these corrections with opposite signs to Table XVIIL., we obtain the
residual phenomenon as follows, in hundredths of feet.
