Figure 13. (a) Noise spectrum of the 8 March 2005 Mount St. Helens eruption. Broken line below is the noise spectrum prior to
eruption. Red is the large turbulence similarity noise spectrum. (6) Noise spectrum of the 6 August 2008 Tungurahua eruption.
Data are from [22,23].

result is shown in figure 13a. The broken line is the background noise spectrum prior to eruption.
Another example is the Tugurahua eruption on 6 February 2008. This is shown in figure 13b. The
agreement is good considering the fact that the temperature, the size, the exhaust velocity and
