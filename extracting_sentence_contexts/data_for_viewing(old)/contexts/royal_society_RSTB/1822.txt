edge of the plate itself are a number of fine radial strize ; somewhat finer strize also
run down on the inside of the central depression. At the bottom of the depres-
sion there is a fairly large oval aperture, in some cases cut into two D-shaped
apertures by a cross-bar of calcareous material. The plates vary a little in the
extent to which they overlap, some overlapping one another nearly up to the central
depression, others to a much less extent (see fig. 6). A study of the surface view
alone would lead one to believe that the coccoliths of C. pelagica have a simple plate-
like structure with a single central hollow, but an examination of separate coccoliths
from various aspects proves that they have a complicated structure built up on the
same type as that of the coccolith of C. leptopora.

Huxitey, Watiicu, Harcket, &c., have all studied in detail from the deep sea
deposits objects which they called coccoliths; these are, in point of fact, the con-
stituent plates of C. pelagica. Huxury, as is well known, compared the form of the
plates, to which he gave the special name of cyatholiths,* to two shallow watch-
glasses, placed one inside the other, with a pad of some substance, such as paraffin,
between. Watticu also compared them to a shirt-stud, but the first satisfactory
explanation of the structure of the plates (of C. pelagica) is that given by
Messrs. Dixon and Jotty (‘ Nature,’ September 10, 1897) in their description of the
coccoliths obtained by them in the waters of Dublin Bay, specimens of which they
have been good enough to give us for examination. We determine them to be
the coccoliths of C. pelagica. It is their interpretation, with some modifications,
that we believe to be the correct one. As they point out, owing to its small size,
its transparency and its complexity of structure, the coceolith (of C. pelagica) is a
very difficult object (though, of course, it is very much larger and more distinct than
