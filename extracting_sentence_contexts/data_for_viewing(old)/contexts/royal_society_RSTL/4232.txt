The numbers in this table present several subjects for our consideration.

First, it is to be remarked that the difference between the numbers of the second
and third columns corresponds to the number in the last column of the table on
page 30 (it is, in fact, the double of that number) ; but the exhibition of the numbers
in this form serves, in some instances, to point out their origin more distinctly. At
Limerick, for instance, it appears that a large tide produces less effect on the low
water than on the high water; and the reason evidently is, that the height of low
water there depends more upon the freshwater current of the river Shannon, than
upon. the state of the water in the sea, whereas the height of high water depends
mainly on the sea. The same explanation applies at New Ross and at Passage West.
It does not however apply to Mullaghmore, Port Rush, Ballycastle, or Glenarm ; nor,
with perfect certainty, to Carrowkeel. I must refer to Section X. and some of the
sncceeding sections, for a statement of the laws of the individual tides at these places ;
and sball only remark here, that much remains to be done with the theoretical treat-
ment of the motion of waves, before the tides on the north-eastern coast can be fully
explained.
