The majority of the tracheids were lying parallel
to the surface of the slide, either on their tangential or their radial faces, so that
this operation resulted in the partial or complete removal of one longitudinal wall,
leaving the opposite wall for observation. In order to measure the spiral inclination
of such a wall we require some co-ordinate axis to which to refer. This would be
furnished by the long axis of the cell were it not for the fact that the wall is not, in
general, bounded by parallel sides.* It was therefore found most convenient to
define the long axis of the cell at any point as the direction bisecting the acute angle
between the direction of the two limiting side walls. Tips of cells, bordered pits,
and parts containing obvious deformations were avoided. The inclination of the
fibrils in any cell was then found to be fairly constant over its whole wall surface
(radial or tangential) except perhaps at the tips, where some uncertainty occurred.
