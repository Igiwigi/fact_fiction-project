This contrasts with an earlier study in which
adult (more than P120) and old mice (more than P500)
were monocularly deprived for 7 days immediately after a
10-14 day period of DE; in these animals the observed OD
shift was mediated by an increase in non-deprived-eye
responses [35]. Notwithstanding the different sequences of
MD and DE, it is most likely that the differences in eye-
specific changes reflect mechanistic differences between the
response to MD itself and the recovery from MD [31]. This
hypothesis is based on the fact that the same sequence as
employed here (DE after MD) did cause a very pronounced

Figure 6. Density of perineuronal nets and of PV+- cells in different rearing
conditions. (a) Percentage of PV+ cells that are surrounded by PNNs are
plotted against rearing condition. Values are significantly higher in the nor-
mally reared (CTRL) and in the MD animals without subsequent dark
exposure (MD, DE—) than in the dark-reared animal (DE) and the MD
mice that had a week of dark exposure after re-opening of the deprived
eye (MD, DE+). (6) Density of PV+ cells for all rearing conditions, in
