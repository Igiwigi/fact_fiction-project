Farther on, in the region normally occupied by
green, the green dazzle-tint will be inoperative ; for those parts of the spectrum in
which a negative after-effect (fatigue effect) has been produced, seem to lose the power
of bringing out the corresponding positive after-effect (dazzle-tint) of that colour. Accordingly, the feeble traces of red which extend beyond E and 6 will excite only
the blue and violet dazzle-tints, and not the green, and will, therefore, appear
distinctly purple. As a matter of fact, with a very narrow slit the spectrum seems
for the first few moments to end between b and F in a purplish slate colour. But on
opening the slit the red asserts itself,

Fig. 9, which serves by contrast to bring out the colours of fig. 8, represents the
appearance of the spectrum towards the end of recovery from violet-blindness. The
positive after-effect has nearly passed off and the colours have their normal hue, but
the violet is still invisible.
