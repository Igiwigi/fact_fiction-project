They also engage in grooming
outcomes: more centrally located contest sites elicit greater frenzies after an intergroup conflict [54], presumably as a
effort from the resident group, leading to a higher probability stress-relieving coping strategy [55], which further implies a
of winning the encounter [13,14,18,33]. In contrast, red-tailed strong psychological cost to these encounters. The fact that
monkeys are no more aggressive in central home range areas C-peptide does not decline for winning or losing groups indi-
than in peripheral areas, indicating that the long-term value cates that the energetic cost of these encounters is likely to be
of a resource may be less important than its immediate minimal. Instead, winning groups experience energetic
value [17]. It is unclear why red-tailed monkeys exhibit this benefits that compensate for earlier deficits, and losing
pattern, and whether other species are as strongly influenced groups suffer no extraordinary costs.
