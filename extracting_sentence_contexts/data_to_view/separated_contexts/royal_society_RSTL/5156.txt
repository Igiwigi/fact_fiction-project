STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 127

Separated the one from the other, and are no longer to be recognized as distinct
parts. If accidentally broken across, we see that they have a hollow centre, in fact,
a lacuna; but when loose and entire, they appear as rounded dense masses, project-
ing from the surface of which we may not unfrequently detect a few short needle-
like processes. Lacunal cells of the Jatter kind are not, however, very easily de-
tached, for when they have advanced thus far in development, their union with ossified
intercolumnar tissue is too strong to admit of ready separation ; indeed, after this
period their separation is impossible. It has been stated that the granular cells of
cartilage previous to the formation of lacunal cells send out processes.
