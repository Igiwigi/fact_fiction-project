globules to appear in the growing oocyte and are formed in the ground cyto-
plasm in the vicinity of the Golgi elements, and possibly under their influence. The
M-yolk spheres, with the M-C-yolk formed around them, constitute the only other
deutoplasmic bodies I have observed in the oocytes I have worked on, which, it will
be remembered, were all under 8 mm. in diameter. I consider, for the reasons I
have given, that all the M-yolk spheres are formed by a direct transformation of mito-
chondria. I do not know whether, when the yolk is used up in embryogeny, the M-yolk
spheres disappear completely or transform back again into mitochondria. GATENBY
(12) finds that the latter is the case in Limnea stagnalis. He says :—‘* Careful examina-
tion of the mitochondria in the unsegmented egg and in the advanced differentiating
organ or germ-layer seems to establish the fact that the mitochondria shrink gradually
in size pari passu with the differentiating somatic or germ-cells during any stazes I
have examined.” If this is the case also in the bird the M-yolk spheres would be entitled
to be considered as living cell-bodies, and not as deutoplasmic globules. In any case
there are probably a large number of mitochondria which persist unchanged throughout
oogenesis and in the embryonic cells after segmentation. During oogenesis the amount
of mitochondria and Golgi T.1 in the oocyte increases enormously, and a considerable
