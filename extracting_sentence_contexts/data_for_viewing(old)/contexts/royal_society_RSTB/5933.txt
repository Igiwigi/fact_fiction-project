(8) Subsequent Phyllotaxis when I,a was a Leaf.

In all the seven experiments in which I,a was a complete leaf, except No. 1, it arose
almost simultaneously with I, and was joined to I, by its kathodic stipule in the manner
described in the previous section. The causes of the displacement of the centre of I,a
away from the wound and towards I, have already been discussed. I, appeared to
occupy approximately its normal position in the six experiments in which it was joined
to I,a so far as could be judged from its contacts with the older leaves P, and P,, though
it may sometimes have been very slightly displaced in the anodic direction by La.
The angle I,a-I, was therefore considerably less than the normal on account of the
displacement of I,a towards I,, its highest value being 113° (see Table I). In No. 1
indeed, I, was noticeably displaced in the anodic direction, and this was no doubt due
to the fact that in this experiment I,a arose before I, and occupied part of the area which
I, would normally have occupied. The angle I,a-I, in this experiment is thus slightly
larger than in the other six, but still considerably less than the normal.

I, appeared to be slightly displaced towards the wound in all seven experiments.
Its displacement is consistent with the working hypothesis, for there was a vacant space
on the kathodic side of the wound which would normally have given rise to the kathodic
half of I,, and this space was lower than the space which would normally have been
occupied by I;. I, therefore occupied this space. The angle I,—I,, recorded in Table I,
was therefore greater than the normal, except in No. 1, in which the displacement of I,
towards I; more than compensated for the displacement of I, towards the wound, and*
in No. 2 where this angle was normal. The position of I, was critical as it determined
whether the genetic spiral was reversed or not. In five experiments I, arose in approxi-
