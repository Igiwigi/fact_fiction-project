Haustoria are to be found throughout the diseased area, and nowhere else. They
are not developed by the quickly extending runners, but are abundantly formed by
the short branches occupied in filling up the intermediate lacunze between the cells,


UREDO DISPERSA, ERIKSS., AND THE “ MYCOPLASM” HYPOTHESIS. 39

They are put forth by these hyphe, generally from the extreme tip, into the cells
of the epidermis (figs, 4, 16, 20, 34, 37-39) and even into the guard cells or
companion cells of stomata (figs. 14 and 15), as well as into the chlorophyll-cells of
the mesophyll (figs. 12, 13, 30, 40-48, &c.) and into the cells bounding the vascular
bundles (figs. 16a, 31 and 33), but never into any element of the bundle itself. In fact
they accompany the filling up hyphe in all the extra-stelar tissues, but nowhere
else. In no case—a conclusion based on months of search for them—can they be
found beyond the limits mentioned. T have already said that “corpuscules” such as Errksson figures occur in the posi-
tions he indicates, both with and without the little protuberance which connects the
“ corpuscule” with the cell-wall.
