It is easy to see from the tables of RR, ZZ,

and od that the greatest stress-difference is either RR-ZZ or $9-ZZ. In the
sixteen cases tabulated, for which z > c¢/8, the first of these is the greatest stress-

difference, and in the twelve remaining cases the second is the greatest, although,
as a matter of fact, the two stress-differences, for these twelve cases, do not diverge
very much,
