Some Remarks on the Intellectual Faculties of the Negro.

The brain is undoubtedly the organ of the mind. It is the part of our body which
gives us the consciousness of our own existence, and through which we receive the
impressions made upon the external senses, conducted to the brain by the nerves.
Here the perceptions are compared and combined s0 as to produce ideas. In this
organ we think, reason, desire, and will. In short, the brain is the instrument by
which all the operations called intellectual are carried on. It is proved by facts and
observations that animals partake of feelings, sensations, and intellectual faculties in
a higher degree, and approach more nearly to mankind in proportion as their brain
resem√æles more the human brain. An intimate connexion between the structure of
the brain and the intellectual faculties in the animal kingdom cannot be doubted.
As the facts which we have advanced plainly prove that there are no well-marked
and essential differences between the brain of the Negro and European, we must con-
clude that no innate difference in the intellectual faculties can be admitted to exist
between them. This has been denied by philosophers*, naturalists+, and tra-
vellers, who assert that the Ethiopian race is naturally inferior to the European
in intellectual and moral powers. The data upon which such an opinion is based
are either erroneous suppositions and false deductions from anatomy and physiology,
or superficial observations on the intellectual and moral faculties of the Negroes,
made by partial or prejudiced travellers. Very little yalue can be attached to these
researches, when we consider that they have been made for the most part on poor
and unfortunate Negroes in the Colonies, who have been torn from their -native
country and their families, and carried into the West Indies, and doomed there to
a perpetual slavery and hard labour in the sugar plantations. Such is the nature
