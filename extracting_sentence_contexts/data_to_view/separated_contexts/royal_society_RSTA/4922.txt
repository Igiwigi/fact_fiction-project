For example, we show in
§5, for d=3 and any k > 10, that p = i (we restrict in that section to q prime). In §6 we prove, for
d=4and any k>9, that p= $ (again with q restricted to being prime). Isomorphic hyperelliptic curves

We took advantage, in tabulating zeta functions, and also in deriving the formulae described
below in §§5 and 6, of the fact that the same zeta functions in Hg arise repeatedly. For D(x) € Hya, let us denote its coefficients as cy = cy(D):

D(x) = ay ca_1xt-! ++++c1x +¢0. (4.1)

If d € Fy is non-zero, i.e. if p, the characteristic of F, does not divide d, then, on binomial expanding

We can choose u = —d~!cq_1 so as to make the coefficient of yal equal to zero. Furthermore, D(x)
is square-free if and only if D(x + u) is square-free.
