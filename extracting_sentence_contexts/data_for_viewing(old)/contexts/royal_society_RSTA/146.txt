the domain 2. The constant vectors Uj, are the projections of u*(x) onto the spatial eigenbasis.

Through analogous calculations to those in §3a, we find that coefficient vectors in the expansion

(3.25) evolve according to

dU;

an —pDU, + I. P(x) f («09 + 2 Px(09Us (t), : — f(u*(x), »} dx, k=0,1,2,....

(3.26)

The last term arises from the fact that u*(x) satisfies the partial differential equation (2.4), which
allows us to replace the relevant Laplacian term with —f(u*, x). The time derivative and diffusion
terms in (3.26) are linear, yet the reaction term is nonlinear. Furthermore, as the reaction term
involves all possible modes, the system (3.26) is infinite dimensional. We remark that, given
bounded initial data and sufficiently well-behaved f, (3.26) admits a strongly continuous solution
(see §4 of [37]).

For small enough time, we have that each ||U;(#)|| < 5, due to the initial condition (2.3). Then,
on the small timescales where the linear Turing modes dominate, it makes sense to consider
Ux(#) = 5U,(#) where U,(#) = O(1) in 5. We then have that

f («09 + s ,(x)Up(E), : =f («9 +5 )° On(x)O (8), :
