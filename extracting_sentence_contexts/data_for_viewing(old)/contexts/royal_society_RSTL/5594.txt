And let the vertices and faces of the first polyedron taken in any order be represented by
abede., KIM..,
and the vertices and faces of the second polyedron taken in a certain order be represented by
dVede. KW.
Then, forming the 8ubstitution 8ymbol
dVede.. K'L/W..abede.. KIM..,
which denotes that a' is to be written for a, Ãž! for 6... K' for K, &e., if, operating with this upon the symbol
8ystem of the first polyedron, we obtain the symbol system of the second polyedron, the second polyedron
will be syntypic with the first. It should be noticed, that there may be seyeral modes of arrangement of the
vertices and faces of the second polyedron, which will render it syntypic according to the foregoing definition
with the first polyedron, 5. e. the second polyedron may be syntypic in 8everal different ways with the first
polyedron. This is, in fact, the same as saying that a polyedron may be syntypic with itself in several
different ways. Suppose, next, that the number of yertices of the second polyedron is equal to the number
of faces of the first polyedron, and the number of faces of the second polyedron is equal to the number of
vertices of the first polyedron. And let the vertices and faces of the first polyedron in any order be repre-

if, operating with this upon the symbol system of the first polyedron, we obtain the symbol system of the
8econd polyedron, the second polyedron is said to be polar-syntypic with the firs; and, as in the case of
