ever, be determined by fixing with precision the ratio of the volumes of the carbonic
acid and oxygen produced. We have succeeded in devising a method by which this
analysis may be effected even with less than 0:5 cub. cent. of the mixed gases, but this
part of the investigation is still unfinished.

Atmospheric Air is the only gaseous mixture which we have exposed to the action of
the silent discharge. Like pure oxygen, it undergoes a diminution of volume ; but the
operation is more quickly terminated and the contraction is less than with that gas
alone, If, after the passage of the discharge, the vessel be set aside for some hours, the
contraction will be found to augment ; and if the gaseous mixture be now again exposed
to the action of the discharge, a further contraction will take place. On the other
hand, heat destroys a portion only of the contraction at first produced. All these
facts are easily explained from the simultaneous formation of ozone and one of the
higher oxides of nitrogen, and the marked influence of the latter, when formed, in
arresting the formation of the former. 'To the same cause we have sncceeded in
referring an apparently anomalous state of oxygen, produced by passing a stream of
strong electrical sparks, for ome minutes, through that gas containing a trace of nitrogen.
The oxygen becomes by this treatment incapable of contracting or of changing into
ozone under the action of the silent discharge, and only recovers its usual condition by
exposure to heat or by standing for some hours. If the nitrogen amounts to not more
than 345th of the entire volume, this condition cannot be produced more than two or
three times. At first we supposed it to be a new (passive) state of oxygen, but we have
now no hesitation in referring it to the presence of a trace of hyponitric acid gas pro-
duced by the electrical sparks.
