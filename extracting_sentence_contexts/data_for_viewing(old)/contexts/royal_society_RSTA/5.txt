(b) Guiding principles

Continuum mechanics is concerned with the motion of matter in the physical space and with the
forces corresponding to such motions. The classical theory is formulated in a three-dimensional
Euclidean space representing the physical space. At least since the middle of the twentieth
century, a fundamental object of continuum mechanics has been that of a material body which
represents the matter whose motion is studied. It has been recognized that, in general, bodies
need not have natural reference configurations in space, and, as such, they should be represented

mathematically as differentiable manifolds. The notion of a body point makes sense because of the : =
principle of material impenetrability which implies that the configurations of a body in space are : Sy
assumed to be embeddings. In fact, as early as [2], the configurations of a body in space were a
described as charts on the body manifold. We will refer to this point of view of continuum aed
mechanics as the Lagrangian approach. 22

A basic notion of force theory in continuum mechanics is the concept of the stress tensor. : Sg
The mathematical proof of existence of stress, the assumptions needed for the proof and the DNS
mathematical properties of the resulting stress object have been studied since the nineteenth : z
century, notably by Cauchy in the 1820s, by Piola in the 1840s, and are still the subject of research as)

(e.g. [2-10]. In the standard continuum mechanics literature, the existence of stress is proved on
the basis of what is referred to as Cauchy’s postulates, or mathematically equivalent assumptions.
A fundamental principle we apply in our formulation of the Lagrangian approach is the
representation of a mechanical system by its configuration space—the set of all admissible
