After a while, ie. at tsar = 20 hpf, see figure
4c, the exogenous SDFla starts to be produced by the sub-
strate, thereby initiating the mechanisms underlying the
directional migration of the aggregate. In particular, the pla-
code first remains fixed, while elongating along the stripe
of the chemical, see figure 4d. Both the PM agents at the lead-
ing edge of the proto-organ and the dPM individuals forming
the rosette body at its trailing edge in fact express the
migratory receptor Cxcr4 and extend towards the SDFla:
this results in a force balance that inhibits the overall move-
ment of the cluster, as also observed in [13]. At t2 =22 hpf,
see figure 4e, a second rosette-like cluster assembles, just
caudally to the first proto-neuromast. Soon after, see figure
4f , the primordium begins to actively migrate: dPM cells
forming the first rosette in fact undergo partial epithelializa-
tion, thereby not longer expressing Cxcr4 but its not-
migratory-related counterpart Cxcr7.
