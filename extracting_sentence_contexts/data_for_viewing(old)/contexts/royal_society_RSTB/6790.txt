Fic. 52. A purely schematic figure to show the type of variation in fen deposits found at different
levels and at different distances from the sea. It only shows the principles of arrangement of the
fen beds.

In a previous paper members of the Fenland Research Committee have accounted
for each of these by supposing a phase of land elevation following formation of the
peat. It now appears to the present authors that in some instances (e.g. between the
lower peat and deposition of the fen clay) the time available has been too short for
this, and they have assumed that land elevation responsible for the erosion was in
progress during the later stages of peat formation and did, in fact contribute to the
marked dryness of such stages. Direct evidence of the truth of this is hard to come by,
and Professor Swinnerton has assumed that the erosion through the two corresponding
coastal peats at Chapel Point was caused by the fact that the subsidence, in its early
stages, brought within reach of the tidal oscillation ground previously out of reach of
it. We find it difficult, however, to accept this hypothesis for the very wide area of the
fens in which these erosion phenomena are found.

Wetness and dryness

We have already noted that interpretation of Fenland history is complicated by the
fact that dryness and wetness of the surface is affected by the operation of at least
three major factorsâ€”climate, relative movement of land and sea, and the natural
