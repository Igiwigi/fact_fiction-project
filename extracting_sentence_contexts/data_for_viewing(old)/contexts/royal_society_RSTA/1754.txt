transformations of the governing equations. The stabilizing effect of radiation on the RTI has been
demonstrated on NIF in conditions relevant for young supernovae remnants [123,124]. This is the
culmination of a long thought research project [125-127]. Efforts are still underway to increase
the spatial resolution of the x-ray radiographs with point-projection short pulse wire backlighters
[128,129], with the aim of taking advantage of short pulse backlighter capabilities like the
advanced radiographic capability (ARC) laser system at the NIF [130] or Petawatt Aquitaine Laser
(PETAL) on LMJ [131]. These additional laser beamlines, based on OPCPA (Optical Parametric
Chirped Pulse Amplification) technology [132], are extremely useful for generating bright X-ray
sources [130] or protons beams [133] used, for example, to probe magnetized HED plasmas [134].

The plasma universe being magnetized and turbulent, one standing question remains as to
how to explain the level of the observed magnetic field in the interstellar and intracluster media
(ISM and ICM, respectively). In fact, the current strength of the magnetic fields exceeds by
many orders of magnitude their original seeds. Observations indicate that both the ISM and
the ICM are in a highly disturbed, turbulent state as a result of shocks and stirring by violent
astrophysical phenomena. Given this, the most widely invoked scenario for the generation of
cosmic magnetic fields is some form of turbulent dynamo [135]â€”a fast (exponential) amplification
of stochastic fields by the turbulent motions of the plasma. How the mechanism operates in
compressible plasmas and how the energy is distributed among velocity, magnetic field, and
density fluctuations, has only been studied theoretically and is not well understood. A series


of experiments have been fielded on small to large scale fields to evidence the generation
and amplification of magnetic fields [27,136-138]. The first laboratory evidence of dynamo
amplification in a subsonic turbulent plasma was acquired very recently [27,139]. In contrast,
