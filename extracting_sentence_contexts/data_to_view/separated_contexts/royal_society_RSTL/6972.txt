It is thus seen that corrosive sublimate, while increasing the changes which develope
carbonic acid, has an almost negative effect on those depending upon oxidation ; if
anything rather diminishing them than otherwise. Oxygen. Carbonie acid. | Nitrogen. | Total oxygen.

of corrosive sublimate on the animal body, which, as far as I am aware, has hitherto
escaped notice, namely, i7s cardiac action. As we have already seen, there exist in the
vegetable kingdom substances which, in consequence of their acting specially on the
heart and lungs, have acquired the title of cardiac and respiratory poisons; few are,
however, aware that in the mineral kingdom there are also substances to be met with,
the peculiar action of which on the animal body is such as to entitle them with equal
justice to the name of cardiac and respiratory poisons. GCorrosive sublimate is an
example of the former, protosulphate of iron of the latter.
