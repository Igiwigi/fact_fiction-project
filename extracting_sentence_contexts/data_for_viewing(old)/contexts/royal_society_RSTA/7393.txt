characteristics. If the train were produced from a lightning stroke at this end of the line of
force, the first whistler heard would have made altogether two journeys over the equator,
the second two further journeys, and so on. Hence one would expect the dispersions of the
successive whistlers to be in the ratios 2:4:6:8, etc. If, however, the stroke occurred at the
opposite end the first whistler of the train would be a short whistler, haying made only one
traverse of the path, the next would make altogether three traverses, and so on. In this case,
, etc. As described in ยง7 above, both

therefore, one would expect the ratios to be 1:3:
types of train have been observed and the dispersions are indeed in these ratios.

The variations of the occurrence of the two types of whistler (figures 10 and 11) seem
capable of simple explanation in this way. Thus the fact that fewer whistlers are heard during
the day than the night is ascribed to the action of absorption in the lower ionosphere, and
the asymmetry of the daily variation records about midnight to the circumstance that
thunderstorm activity is greatest in the late afternoon. Likewise the increase in the numbers
of the long whistlers from winter to summer agrees with the known seasonal variation of

thunderstorm activity, while the accompanying decrease in the numbers of short whistlers

is explained by the fact that the seasons alternate in the two hemispheres. We defer dis-
cussion of the effect of magnetic activity on the incidence of whistlers, here noting only that

since thunderstorms and magnetic activity are not related the effect must be one on the
