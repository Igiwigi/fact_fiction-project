S Pasteur, behaved very similarly to the last series. All that concerns us here is that
i; the whole of the five tubes infected with the swarming rodlets developed the gelati-
"e nous cushions within the fortnight, and were stiff throughout in from three to five
2 weeks. It remains to add that Tube XVII., designed to go into an atmosphere of
2 hydrogen, was inadvertently placed in air at 15° C. ; its behaviour was, accordingly,
< like that of the Tubes XIX. and XX. in every respect.

< On looking over the records of these two double series of cultures, in bouillon-sugar
6 and bouillon-Pasteur, several points of interest are noticeable, in addition to the proof
= much of greater nutritive value of these media.

-4 In the first place, it is evident once more that the organism is anaérobic in a high
"2 degree ; and I would call attention to the fact that the cushion—i.c., the gelatinous
2 coils—do not form until there is a large quantity of carbon dioxide in the liquids.
3 Even in the case of the tubes charged with hydrogen, and kept in an atmosphere of
'S that gas, the medium gradually became saturated with carbon dioxide in those cases
£ where a carbo-hydrate was present—a significant fact, I think, as indicating the source
2 of the carbon dioxide; and it is noticeable how much sooner the cushions were
developed in the tubes kept (in air) at 25° C. than in those at 15° C., a fact explicable
by the enhanced activity of the organism in its early stages. These tubes in air also
% show that, in its free stages, the organism can be aérobic, though the cultures in
3 carbon dioxide prove that oxygen is not necessary.

: T have other evidence, however, which goes to show, not only that the above
© conclusions are correct, but that the presence of the carbon dioxide is necessary for
