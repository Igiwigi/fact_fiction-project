Now that the mode of reproduction of the microspheri ic form
_is known (see Postscript 2) this view becomes untenable, unless it is supposed that
_ the bodies in question belong to yet another phase in the life-history. The more
probable view appears to be that they were not the spores of Polystomella at all, but
| pyere the products of some other organism which had entered the shell of the
_ Polystomella. This is supported by the fact that a considerable amount of proto-
occupied the central chambers of the specimen and showed no indication of
divided up into spores.â€”March 13, 1895. | The evidence afforded by the investigation of Polystomella may now be reviewed.
