I am
indebted to M. BarLarp of Bartges for almost the only definite statement I have been
able to obtain as to the constancy of the temperature of hot springs at different
seasons, He informs me (I translate from a memorandum made in his presence)
that he has made perhaps ten series of observations on all the springs of Bartges
between the months of June and September, and that he has not obseryed the tem-
perature to vary by one tenth of a degree of REaumur. This is a very inleresting
fact ; and it will be seen below that two experiments made by myself on the Douche
of Le Tambour at the interval of a fortnight, and with very great care, do not differ
by one tenth of a degree of Fanrexnim. TRrouUGnToON. Reduced.
