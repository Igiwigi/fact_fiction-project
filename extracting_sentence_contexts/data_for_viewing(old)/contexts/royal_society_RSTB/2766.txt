their breeds than with other rams (Harr, 1899) may perhaps be similarly
explained.

On the other hand, with Dorset Horns, Mr. Heave describes the ewes as being
less barren with Hampshire Down rams than with Dorset Horn rams. Referring
to a general instability of the reproductive system of Dorset Horn ewes, and
their need for some special stimulus, he appears to suggest that this is supplied
by the use of a Down ram. I think that it is more probable that what in these
cases is described as barrenness is in reality very early abortion, an unavoidable
element of error, which Mr, Hears recognises as present in his statistics for sheep
generally, (though he states that he believes the error is, as a rule, small) being in
the case of the Dorset sheep somewhat larger than elsewhere in the returns given.
That this is the true explanation is rendered the more probable by the facts also
recorded by Mr. Hrapr, ‘ thit, of all breeds, the Dorset Horns appear to be most
liable to abortion,” and further, that in some cases, ** Dorset Horn ewes which slip
lambs got by Dorset Horn rams will bear lambs got by Down rams.” I would suggest
that in this case the cause of abortion lies, not so much with the ewe, as in want of
vitality in the embryo, which when aborted early is absorbed in the uterus, escaping
the notice of the shepherd; and that where the Dorset Horn sheep have been served
by Down rams, there is less abortion as a result of increased vigour on the part of
the cross-bred young.
