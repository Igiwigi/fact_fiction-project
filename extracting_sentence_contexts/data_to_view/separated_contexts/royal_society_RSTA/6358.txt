This supports a conclusion that there are multiple drivers of
ecosystem respiration radiocarbon across the observed range of values with the majority of our
time series data driven by TD, soil temperature and NDVI (plant productivity), while the negative
excursions being best explained by changing moisture dynamics [87]. The interacting controls of warming and permafrost thaw in combination with soil drying
acting to increase old C loss was supported by the previous isotope partitioning study [29] as


well as the observation that the radiocarbon time series decline was greatest (most negative
slope) for the drying experiment as compared with the warming experiment and the thaw
gradient (table 1). This latter evidence is somewhat tempered by the fact that the drying
experiment time series was the shortest of all three sites, which can influence slope estimates,
and that the drying manipulation was stopped before the end of the time series. Nevertheless,
cold temperatures/freezing and soil saturation together acting to slow old C release are
protection mechanisms that could shift with warming and permafrost thaw. Widespread warming
and permafrost thaw is generally accepted for future climate scenarios as the world warms
[17,88-90], but future soil moisture/waterlogging projections are still divergent [91,92].
