Importantly, and as shown in the Results
section, the achieved power for the critical interaction of ‘Go
versus NoGo x non-veridical feature match x congruency x group’
in the ERP data was % = 0.637 ( f= 1.32) (refer to data analysis
of the N2 ERP component). Thus, the effect size observed in the
results is much stronger than that used to estimate necessary
sample size in our a priori calculations. In fact, the results show
that the assumption on which the effect size estimation is based
actually reflects a conservative estimate of effects. The empirical
data show that the obtained effect is much stronger. Matched controls were selected from the general population
and screened with a questionnaire to ensure they did not experi-
ence grapheme-colour synaesthesia.
