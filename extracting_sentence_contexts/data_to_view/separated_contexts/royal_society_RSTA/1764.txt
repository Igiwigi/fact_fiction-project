on each other, being connected by the equation given above, and there will be a
relation between the forms for two different theories. In fact if S and T are the
forms corresponding to any one mode of separation and if we write :

s=8+0

where U is any arbitrary vector function we shall have

where

TVe=iT— | div Udr,

and 8’ and T’ are appropriate forms for a new mode of separation. In this way, by
assigning convenient values for U, we might tentatively construct a number of
interesting formule. The last result also shows why it is that the particular form pee for the kinetic
energy is irrelevant to the general dynamical discussion of paragraph 7.
