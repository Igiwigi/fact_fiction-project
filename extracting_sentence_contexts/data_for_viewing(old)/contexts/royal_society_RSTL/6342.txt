In order to evaluate the expression for u, let p,, Ps «+ Pm Þe values of V which make
fr Fes ++ fn vanish. They may in fact be called roots of f\, fo, --f,,; but as these func-
tions are generally irrational, they cannot be replaced by the products of factors of the
form Y—p. In general there will be only one quantity p for each function F; because
if F be rationalized, it will give rise to a function of the degree m ; but although the
equation 80 formed will in general have m roots, (m—1) of them will in fact be extra-
neous to the particular equation rationalized, and belong one apiece to each of the
remaining equations of the system.
