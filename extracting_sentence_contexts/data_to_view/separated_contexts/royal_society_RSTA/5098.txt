§ In calculating the emissivity from the recorded deflections of the galvanometer,
the first process was to obtain the “corrected deflection”* of the galvanometer. s Secondly, a correction is applied to the numbers for the fact that the deflection
‘eproduced by the thermo-junction is not in simple proportion to the difference of
sp temperatures (defined by the air thermometer) between the two junctions.t Thus a
‘< series of numbers is obtained corresponding to the successive times noted, the
‘5 intervals being 5 minutes or 2} minutes, as has already been mentioned. From these
numbers I have calculated the value of the “emissivity,” or quantity of heat lost per
“5 Second, per square centimetre of surface, per degree centigrade of difference of
2 temperatures of surface and surroundings. @ Let c be the capacity for heat of the cooling globe, S the surface, and (v — %) the
} difference of temperatures of source and surroundings at any time ¢. Then in the

3 the coefficient e corresponds with the definition of “emissivity ” just given ; and this
formula is commonly taken to be a representation of the “law of cooling,” whether in
