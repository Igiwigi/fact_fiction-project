Gaussian beams not with a single point on the sphere but with a family of classical orbits on
a circle whose axis is specified by the point on the sphere, and whose radius is determined by
the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, known to be exact for harmonic oscillators. The structure of the


caustics of the ellipse family determine the structure of the Gaussian modes, and, in particular,
are circular and rectangular for LG and HG beams.

The families of ellipses in figure 6d-f, which semiclassically represent LG, HG and GG modes,
respectively, correspond to all of the classical orbits with this particular value of H and L,M or
XM + YM + ZL; in the original Hamiltonian phase space, these values are on tori, as discussed
in §2, and the ellipse families plotted are, in fact, projections of these tori onto two-dimensional
configuration space (Qy, Qy). The fact that they are tori is evident: the circularly symmetric case
of figure 6d is a projection down the torus axis, (¢) is a side view and (f) is a typical view without
any special symmetries.

A full discussion of separability of Gaussian wavepackets is beyond the scope of the present
article, and can be approached by a reformulation of the mechanical problem in terms of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. It has been proved [33,34] that there are three coordinate systems
in which the quantum two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is separable: plane polar =
coordinates (giving the LG modes), Cartesian coordinates (giving the HG modes) and elliptic : 35
coordinates, giving the Ince-Gaussian modes [35,36] (the latter is a family of coordinate systems,
parametrized by the inter-focal distance f, smoothly interpolating between polar and Cartesian mea)
coordinates), which are products of Ince polynomials [34,37] in elliptic coordinate variables.
The underlying classical dynamics of the Ince-Gaussian modes will be explored elsewhere; the a]
