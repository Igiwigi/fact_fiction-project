Relative numerousness discrimination [26] requires an ability
to make size difference judgements between two sets, such as
‘more than...,’ ‘less than...’ [37]. Numerical discrimination
has been considered a first and elementary level of numerical
comprehension, at the basis of natural and spontaneous
behaviours.

In one of the very first studies on number discrimination
learning in day-old domestic chicks [38], their capability to
amodally complete partially occluded objects [39] was
exploited as a strategy to control for continuous-quantity
cues. In fact, previous studies had shown that chicks percep-
tually completed the missing parts of objects, recognizing
partly occluded objects as the corresponding whole objects
[39]. This perceptive process had been previously described
in humans and it is known as ‘amodal completion’ [40].

Day-old chicks were trained, for food reinforcement, to
discriminate small sets of identical elements—1 versus 2,
2 versus 3—by pecking at a stimulus depicting a target
numerousness, while ignoring the other one [38]. For
example, a group of birds was trained to peck at the one-
element stimulus and to ignore the two-element stimulus;
and vice versa for the other group. During training, both in
