Thus it
stains with iodine, and when coloured with methyl violeb is not digsolved by
glycerine (Plate 68, fig. 6). It is also well brought out by HorMaNnN's blue, the
staining characters of which have already been sufficiently dwelb upon. That it is
not callus is clear from the fact that it does not dissolve in sulphurie acid. The
structure traversing the pit membrane is somewhat difficult to observe, both on
account of its very 8mall size and its want of definition. Indeed, it rather presents
the appearance of a small blue cloud between the ends of the deeply-stained and well-
defined processes.
