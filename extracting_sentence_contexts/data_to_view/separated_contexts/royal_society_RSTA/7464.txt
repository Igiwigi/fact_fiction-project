attitude it is possible to calculate the size which a nucleus must reach before it will be stable
and continue to grow in a solution of known supersaturation. A nucleus smaller than the
critical size would have a high solution pressure and would be more likely to dissolve than
to grow. This seems to be in qualitative accord with the demonstration by Hulett (1901)
that very small crystals of gypsum show enhanced apparent solubility in water and also
with the fact that slightly supersaturated solutions do not nucleate spontaneously. Calcula-
tions based on such considerations suggest that the barrier to nucleation would be so very
high as to cast doubt on the correctness of the assumptions. For instance, it has been shown
in this Department, by developing a treatment of the problem by Jones (1913), that in
potassium sulphate solution at a concentration 1-4 times the saturation value, the minimum
radius of a stable spherical crystal would be about 3-6 10-8 cm.
