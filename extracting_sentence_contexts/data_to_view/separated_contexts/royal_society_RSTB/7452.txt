The fate of this sample must therefore be examined in
more detail. We may first see if there was evidence that trapping in January had weakened the
unmarked voles and increased their subsequent death-rate. Conditions at the time were
not obviously severe and there was no abnormal death-rate in the traps on block Q, but
there was in fact a rather poor recovery of newly marked voles. This difference is not
statistically significant, however, and there is no evidence from other months that it might
have been expected. Indeed, the only other evidence—from the November sample—is
in the other direction.
