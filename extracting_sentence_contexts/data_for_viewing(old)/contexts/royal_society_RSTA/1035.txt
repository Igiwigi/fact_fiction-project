The core analytical approach to solving the problem that corresponds to the flow having the
specific form given by equations (2.2) and (2.3) is given below. It is important to bear in mind that,
for the fully nonlinear problem, other solutions might exist. We are only proving the existence and
uniqueness of flows given by (2.2) and (2.3).


Let us define the operator G: (L?(Q))? + (L?(@))* such that
n
G(T)T=2{(1+2R2 ITP)’ +R} T, (3.8)

which clearly is not linear, but it still has some useful properties that can help in our task of finding
a solution. In fact, it is easy to see that

Nn
|{(2+2R2IT?)" +R} T pq OF R9)ITlac@y, 6.9)
ie. G(\T|)T € (L2(2))?, and also
1
Rs ITIPacg) = I. {(1+2R2 ITP)" + Ro] T- Tax. (3.10)

Now, we take T, S € (L?(2))? (\(C1(2))* and let t > 0 to calculate the following:
[tsar + 1S/?)(T + tS) — G(IT*)T] - [(T + #8) — T] dx. (3.11)
Rearranging terms and dividing by 1/#? yields
I. ZIG(T + #S|?) — G(\TP)IT- Sdx + I. G(T + tS|?)S - Sdx, (3.12)
and by letting t > 0 we obtain
