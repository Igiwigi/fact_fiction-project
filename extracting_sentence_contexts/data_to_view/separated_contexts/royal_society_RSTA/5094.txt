A new design approach involving damage tolerant structural design and condition : =
monitoring, with specific applications to improved design of blades, is proposed in the paper : Ss

by McGugan et al. [42]. In recognition of the fact that large ‘perfect’ blades are not possible
to manufacture, that large blades with defects or damages are too costly to discard, and that
manual inspection may be too expensive for offshore wind turbines, the authors propose an
original design approach combining damage tolerant materials, built-in sensors to detect evolving
damage, non-destructive experimental tests to characterize damage, and detailed FE structural
models of damaged blades to estimate residual fatigue life and strength. Examples of levers for
obtaining high damage tolerant composite materials for blades are identified in crack bridging
provided by fibres connecting crack faces behind a crack tip, and high-energy absorbing interfaces
between layers. By the proposed approach the service life of blades may be decided based on
their damage state, with a potential for life extension beyond the original planned service life for
healthy blades.
