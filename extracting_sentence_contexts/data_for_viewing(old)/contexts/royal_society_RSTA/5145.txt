the blade tip in the flapwise direction for the jth blade is given by

fill) =2ATo(#) sin(go). (3.3)

In the mathematical framework adopted in this study, the active control forces have been
modelled as external modal loads applied to each blade. The principle of virtual work is used
again in order to include the effect of the controller into the Lagrangian formulation.

A numerical simulation is carried out to illustrate the capabilities of the active tendon
controller described above. The numerical model presented in §2 has been simulated using the
specifications of the NREL 5 MW baseline reference wind turbine [41]. It should be noted that,
although offshore dynamics are not included in this study, the control principles illustrated in
what follows are equally valid for both onshore and offshore systems. In fact, the numerical
results presented in the paper can readily be extended to offshore wind turbines. A linear
