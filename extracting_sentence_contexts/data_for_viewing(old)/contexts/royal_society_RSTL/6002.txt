or a total average of 35:97 oz. of carbonic acid, and 9:72 oz. of carbon in the twenty-four
hours.

I do not know how to compare these results with those given by previous observers.

since the degree of exertion and other circumstances are not, recorded by the latter,
and hence it is impossible to appreciate the state of the system to which they refer.

It is noticeable how great is the difference amongst men in the amount of carbon
which they expire—a fact which has been observed by all inquirers. 'Thus Professor
FRANKLAND and myself differed as 2 to 3, and yet we were nearly of the same age and
height, but differed greatly in weight and robustness of constitution. Each person als
differs much at various periods—a circumstance noticed by BaRrRaL. Mr. Mov, varied
as 10 to 11, and I at least as 11 to 12. Hence it is safer to adopt comparative rather than
absolute quantities in determining the quantity of carbonic acid exhaled per day by any
individual. Thus if the amount of carbonic acid exhaled in a state of quietude in the
day-time be determined by observations made at various periods of the day in relation
to the meal hours, the amount exhaled during six hours of the night may be determined
by allowing the amount of 3: hours of the day; and in reference to exercise, by allow-
ing 14 hour rest for one hour of walking at two miles per hour, and 24 hours of rest
for one hour of walking at three miles per hour.
