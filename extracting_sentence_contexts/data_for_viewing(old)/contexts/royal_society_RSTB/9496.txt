the weight to be assigned to the findings arising from the fin-
gerprint examination, (3) update the probabilities to get the
posterior probabilities and finally (4) make a decision consid-
ering the result of (3) and weighted balance between benefits
and costs associated with each decision. To the question of
whether or not it is appropriate for an expert to take respon-
sibility for that entire decision process, my position remains
unchanged [73]: the expert should only devote his or her tes-
timony to the strength to be attached to the forensic findings
and that value is best expressed using a likelihood ratio.
The questions of the relevant population—which impacts
on prior probabilities—and decision thresholds are outside
the expert’s province but rightly belong to the fact finder.

The topic of inference is fundamental to the issue. Most of the
research in the fingerprint field is empirical, whereas the nature
of the problem at first stance is logical, one of the reasonable
reasoning in the face of uncertainty. This issue is conceptual,
and it needs to be properly understood first before even starting
to think about empirical work/research to generate data that
could help translating the inferential concept into practice.

(b) Improving transparency

This is a call for greater candour in case files, report writing
