for example of the so-called alpha-dynamos, in many papers and books (see [34,35], and e.g.
[36,37] for references). Similarly, magnetic helicity is involved in the saturation (and possibly the


enhancement) mechanism of the large-scale dynamo when the magnetic field is strong enough to ls |
react on the velocity [38].

More specifically, the generation of magnetic fields by turbulent motions was described 3
analytically more than 50 years ago; it did emphasize the central role played by kinetic helicity in : =
the large-scale dynamo. Since helicity can be viewed as a specific combination of velocity shear [3
components, one that remains invariant in the inviscid case, one can remark that helical dynamos 13

in fact also cover the case of shear dynamos. When using a classical turbulence model (one similar
to what was described in the previous section, but Markovianized), one observes a substantially
different critical magnetic Reynolds number for the onset of dynamo action whether or not the
flow is helical [39], a result corroborated by DNS [40]. It has also been realized that, even in the
absence of helicity but with helicity fluctuations, a dynamo is still at play [41] although it needs a
larger separation of scales to be established.

In fact, the effect on large-scale properties of a turbulent flow in MHD in the helical case
was first unraveled with a study of statistical mechanics, taking into account all three invariants
(Kr, Hm, Hc) [42]. In that case, there are values of the Lagrange multipliers (corresponding to the

invariants) that lead to spectra peaking in the large scales, contrary to the pure hydrodynamic : =
fluid with helicity [43]. It is then not surprising that, in the nonlinear regime, it is now the 1B
