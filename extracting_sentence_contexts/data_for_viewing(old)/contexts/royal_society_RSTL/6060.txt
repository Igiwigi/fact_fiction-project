Hf temperature, T the temperature from absolute zero, e the expansibility by heat, p the
Sressure in pounds on the square foot, J the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit
Sn foot-pounds, and K the capacity for heat in pounds of water, of a cubic foot of the
Huid employed. He has also given a Table of theoretical results for the compression of
Water and mercury. The investigation being established on the basis of well-ascertained
-Srinciples and facts, the correctness of the Table could not be reasonably doubted.
Nevyertheless, believing that an experimental inquiry would be interesting if not im-
Fortant, I have ventured to offer the following to the notice of the Royal Society.
'> The only previous experiments on the subject of which I am aware are those of
al. Recxauir. To his memoir on the Compressibility of Liquids, he appends a notef
Sm the heat disengaged by the compression of water. The method employed by this
Helebrated physicist, though less delicate, is s8imilar to that which I have adopted. One
Set of the junctions of a thermo-electric pile was placed in a copper vessel filled with
Srater, to which a pressure of ten atmospheres could be instantaneously communicated
Py means of a reservoir of compressed air. The #;th of a degree Centigrade could be
Yletected by his thermo-multiplier. Nevertheless the conclusion arrived at was the
egative one, that * the heat disengaged by a sudden pressure of ten atmospheres on
Syater is unable to raise its temperature th of a degree Centigrade.”
