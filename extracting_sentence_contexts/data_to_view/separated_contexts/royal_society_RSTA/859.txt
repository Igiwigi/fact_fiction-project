Results are more inconsistent for water cycle extremes, as also previously 8 |
highlighted [8]. However, it is interesting to note that the analyses based on the HAPPI

simulations seem to show more frequently significant changes between the two warming levels, a
also for the water cycle extremes. This could be due to the fact that the larger number of ensemble 2
members per model allows for more robust statistics. On the other hand, it is also possible that 1g
the HAPPI-based ensemble underestimates inter-model uncertainty due to the smaller number of 1s

considered climate models (five) compared to those used in the ESR-CMIP5 estimates (26) and the
prescribed SST conditions (see also previous section). This could be in particular the case for the
estimates of changes in CDD, which are in part inconsistent (also in terms of sign) between the
ESR-CMIP5 and HAPPI estimates (figures 6 and 7), since drought projections are known to be
strongly model-dependent and to display large decadal variability [35].
