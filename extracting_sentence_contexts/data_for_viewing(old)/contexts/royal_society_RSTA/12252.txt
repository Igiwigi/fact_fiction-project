platinite of potassium and spread over a sized paper and dried. When light acts on
this mixture it reduces the iron salt to the ferrous state proportionately to the
intensity of the light and to the time during which it acts. When such an exposed
paper is placed on a hot solution of potassium oxalate (neutral) the salt reduces the
platinum salt, and metallic platinum (platinum black) is deposited. The black or
grey produced by this means is most suitable for measuring in the manner which will
subsequently be described.

The other desideratum is also found in this process. The prints are absolutely
permanent, and the records obtained by it can be referred to at any time, and
re-measured if necessary. Further, the paper keeps well before exposure, and after
exposure and before development. When kept dry in an air-tight box with calcium
chloride in contact with the air, in fact, it will keep unaltered in sensitiveness for
several months. As an example of this it may be mentioned that two pieces of paper
cut from the same sheet were each exposed to various and similar intensities of light
for equal times. One was developed on the potassium oxalate solution immediately
after exposure, and the other was not developed till about six weeks had elapsed ; on
measuring the greys on the two papers their darkness was found to be precisely the
same, and the unexposed parts equally white in the two cases.

It was, for these reasons, determined to use the platinum process for the experi-
ments detailed.
