Thus
in order to introduce the reduction factor of 2 by the occurrence of fictitious values
of the fecundity, we should have to suppose about 37 per cent. of fictitious values to
occur. This is, of course, a sort of average; many values will probably be only
partially fictitious, ze, will to some extent approximate to their real values. Considering the very artificial character of the thoroughbred brood-mare, and the
uncertainty of her treatment by breeders, this does not seem such an immense
percentage that it would force us to the conclusion that the law of ancestral heredity
cannot be true for the inheritance of fecundity. (ii.)
