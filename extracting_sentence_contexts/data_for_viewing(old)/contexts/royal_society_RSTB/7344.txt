TasLe 114. THE APPEARANCES OF THE BARS OF A GRATING

width of bars

stage appearance (cone units)
1 nodular 3-0
2 wavy 2-0
3 criss-cross 17
4 diamonds 15
5 fine horizontal lines 1-0
6 uniform 0-8

During these observations, another curious fact was noticed: when the correcting lens in
front of the observerâ€™s eye, was moved vertically or horizontally, the nodular or wavy
appearance also seemed to move across the pattern. When the movement of the lens was
parallel with the bars of the grating, the pattern appeared to move in the same direction
as the lens; when the movement of the lens was at right-angles to the bars, the pattern
appeared to move in the opposite direction to that of the lens. The cause of these move-
ments is not known.

(159) The perception of small coloured test objects

Attention has been directed previously to the fact that yellow and blue test objects in
close apposition, tend to decolorize one another. This was particularly noticed in the case
of a grating consisting of alternate blue and yellow bars, which were replaced by black
