For if we pub c*=#, and note that N varies as a, and that n' has the form (h—kz)/C",
we see that it would only be necessary to evaluate a series of integrals of the form

from zq to z, and the time scale is the same for all the planets. It is not at present
worth while to pursue this hypothetical case further. Now if we suppose the planet to raise frictional tides in the un, as well as the 8un
to raise tides in the planets, we easily see by a double application of (2) that

The tides raised in the planet by its satellites do not occur explicitly in this equation,
but they do occur implicitly, becanse 1, the planet's rotation, is affected by these tides.
