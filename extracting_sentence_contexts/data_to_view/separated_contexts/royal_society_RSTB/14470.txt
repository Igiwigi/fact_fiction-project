There has long been debate on the effectiveness of for contrasts between conditions where the impression of
binocular distance cues (e.g. vergence, vertical disparity) for stereopsis is present (stereoscopic images, monocular aper-
derivation of egocentric distance (see [82,83]). Even if these ture viewing of single pictures) and conditions where it is
cues were valid, disparity scaling by vergence (or vertical absent (binocular viewing of single pictures). The fact that
disparity) would likely only be effective within reach space the same parietal regions are activated under both binocular
(1-2 m; [38,83]). This implies that available visual information and monocular stereopsis provides neurophysiological sup-
restricts effective derivation of scaled intra- and inter-object dis- port to the view that the phenomenology of object solidity,
tances to a limited region of space near the observer. By contrast, tangibility and spatial separation that underlies our
tasks requiring judgements of egocentric distance to targets in impression of realness of a 3D scene derives from cortical
action space and beyond (greater than 2 m; e.g. blind walking mechanisms that are independent of the specific cues (e.g.
to previewed targets) are thought to rely on ground plane infor- binocular disparity) that activate them.
