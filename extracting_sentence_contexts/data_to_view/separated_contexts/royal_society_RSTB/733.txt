In other cases, when in the stages of early development in the fermenting vessels,
the lumps are softer and more viscous than when fully formed; and, in fact, every
transitional stage can be met with from the condition of a slimy, semi-fluid, soft jelly,
to that of a hard horny mass which breaks like glue or cartilage. These physical characteristics are dependent on the amount of water present
in the lumps. Obviously the specific gravity of the fresh pieces will vary according to the amount
of water present, also: I have not examined this point in much detail, but the
following facts may be noted. The lumps fall rapidly in alcohol, in distilled water,
and even in Pasrrur’s solution and other media of high specific gravity. Some idea
of the amount of water contained in the lumps may be derived from the following
observation :—On August 27th, I started a culture in a sterilised soda-water flask.
