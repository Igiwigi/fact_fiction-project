We also considered rates of laughter occurring in the
all-day recordings as a function of the amount of IDS and
whether the infant was alone during the 5 min segments as
indicated by the questionnaire items. Results for the second
half-year support the long-recognized fact that laughter is a
social phenomenon, with 6.6 times more laughter occurring
with IDS than without IDS, and 8.8 times more laughter
when infants were not alone than otherwise. At the
same time, also in the second half-year, even in segments
when someone was talking to an infant, the rate of laugh-
ter (0.098 per minute) was very small compared with
protophone rates (4.8 per minute).

endogenous nature of vocal development
The massive rate of protophone production as seen robustly
in a variety of circumstances in the present results as well
as prior studies cited above, along with the fact that proto-
phones are largely directed to nobody from the beginning
of human life and throughout the first year, compel us to
recognize that the activity is predominantly generated
endogenously. Laughter and cry/whimper, on the other
hand, are generated primarily in situations of either social
play or distress, but at rates that are much lower than for
protophones (figures 1 and 2). These more emotionally
grounded signals play the same kind of role in humans that
similar vocalizations play in other mammals and promi-
nently in the great apes.
