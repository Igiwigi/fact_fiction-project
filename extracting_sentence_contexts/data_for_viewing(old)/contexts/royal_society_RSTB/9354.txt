mechanism. In agreement, chronic inhibition of NO synthesis
has been reported to lead to an enhanced expression of COX2
in rat mesenteric arteries [85]. Therefore, another system in
addition to the brain the induced absence of NO simulated
by NOS inhibitor chronic treatment exhibit increase the
expression of COX2 with less amounts of NO [85].

Overexpression of nNOS elicits S-nitrosylation of COX2
and activation of prostaglandin formation [86]. On the con-
trary, a large number of reports support the idea that NO
can inactivate COX2 [87,88]. In several experimental
models, COX2 has been linked to anti-inflammatory and
neuroprotective properties [89,90]. In fact, prolonged overex-
pression of COX2 in the brain has been associated with the
delayed cell death that occurs after many types of brain
injuries [91]. These apparently contradictory results of NO
influence on COX2 expression may be related to the levels
of NO, the cell type and/or the state of activation of the
cells [83,92].

Another possibility would be COX2 expression regulation
of transcription, since COX2 end products can modulate gene
expression [93]. Berke et al. [94] and Gerfen [95] proposed
that COX2 mRNA induction in the striatum of hemi-Parkinso-
nian rat involves genetic adaptation mechanisms triggered by
