It follows immediately that the conic through five consecutive points meets the curve
again in a point which is found by joining the original point to its second tangential,
and taking the point where the joining line meets the curve again. We deduce hence

_ at once M. PLicker's determination of the points at which a conic can osculate a
cubic in six points. In fact, if the point just determined were to coincide with the
