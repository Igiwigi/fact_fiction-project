I say © generally,” because this experiment
was not invariably successful—any more, I may add, than was the first-mentioned and
almost identical experiment in which minimal stimulation was employed (see para-
graph g). Nevertheless, the exceptions were but slight, and always on the side of
somewhat fewer contractions occurring in a given time in response to the single shocks
than in response to faradaic stimulation. And as this is the direction in which we
should expect, from the principle of the summation of stimuli, that slight deviations
from the ordinary rule would occur, if they occurred at all, I do not think that the
fact of their occurrence tends to impair the confirmation which these experiments
certainly afford to the hypothesis we are considering. (z.) Indeed, it 8eems to me that this hypothesis is 80 fully substantiated by these
experiments, that I feel it is almost superfluous to adduce another experiment having
the same tendency.
