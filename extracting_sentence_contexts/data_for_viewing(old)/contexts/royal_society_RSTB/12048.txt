one can envision a critical temperature for repelling fluid mixtures beyond which the mixture would be homogeneous, while
the phases are separated for temperatures below the critical temperature. Such a model was conceived by Flory and Huggins
in the 1940s [160,161] to describe the behaviour of a mixture of polymers and has hence been used to predict the response of
various kinds of mixtures. When applied to protein gases on fluid membranes, curvature modifies the energy required to
place a protein molecule in a given membrane location (its chemical potential), which can lead to protein-rich curved
domains in conditions where a planar membrane would remain homogeneously mixed.
