where p,, A,, B,, and y, are constants. Then following Maxweti* p, would have
to satisfy an equation similar to, but not identical with, the “ stability’ equation
(C.s), arrived at in §6 of this paper. If we assume that the number of terms
in the summation is finite, we prescribe arbitrarily the form of the solutions of the
differential equations. On the other hand, if, following Maxweti, we regard

argument, we must take cognizance of the fact that 9, and c, are defined only for
a discrete set of values of x, viz., for orb (sad eet)

The writer has verified that by employing formule (3-1/2) and (3-2/2) and by
using solutions of the equations (A’.s) and (B’.s) one can obtain formule for ¢,
and c, which are real functions of ¢ containing 4n real arbitrary constants as required
by the theory of differential equations. The formule thus obtained are practically
of the form stated above.

The model of a ring adopted in §1 of this paper is precisely the same as that of
Maxwer. It was the inapplicability of the Gotpsproucu hypothesis, discussed
in §13, which forms Part II of this paper, which led the writer to the transformation
formule introduced in § 3.
