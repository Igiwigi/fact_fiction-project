It is only fair to state that WiLson describes experiments on the effect of reducing the pressure of

the hydrogen, which gave a much greater diminution in the leak than that observed by the writer (vide
H. A. WI1son, loc, cit., p. 266),


PRODUCED BY HOT PLATINUM IN DIFFERENT GASES. 51

the vessel, since this protracted increasing of the pressure in a vacuum was not
observed after a wire had been heated in other gases. Even if the above large
amount of gas has to be got rid of the rate of escape seems very slow; in fact, the
numbers show thai the law for the rate of diffusion of hydrogen through hot platinum
obtained by Rrcarpson, Nicot and ParNnevL* at pressures greater than 1 millim. does not hold at low pressures. It is probable that at these pressures it is necessary
to take external dissociation into account (vide loc, cit.).
