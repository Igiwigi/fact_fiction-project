A small thing will con-
ceal the decrement of thermal capacity, as will be judged from the succeeding experi-
ments. I may point out here that over and above the quantity of moisture (calculated
to besome 2 milligrammes) necessary to saturate the volume of 160 Â¢.c. of air at the
normal temperature, #,, the effect of moisture is to cause very serious error. Water,
in the form of a liquid, within the sphere must, in fact, be conceived as adding its
latent heat of vaporisation to intensify the error. For every milligramme of water
evaporating within, there will be thrown down externally a corresponding milligramme
of steam. I have already described the results of observations which showed that even
with the use of a much safer apparatus for effecting the compression of the gas,
a considerable weight of water was, in some way, taken up by the gas in its passage
through the pump ; so that it was found essential to re-dry the gas immediately before
its entrance into the sphere.
