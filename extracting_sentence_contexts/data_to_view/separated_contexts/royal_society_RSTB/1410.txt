The largest n
whorls preserved in any of our specimens is 8 (in C.N. 1898 kK, part of
represented in Plate 85, fig. 54) ; the total number was no doubt much great

The coherent portion of the bracts, forming the dise of previous memoirs,
for a distance about equal to the diameter of the axis. It then divided up |
free bracts, or “disc-rays.” The latter had a somewhat lanceolate form, bre
out for some distance from the base, and then tapering again towards the ap
leaving the axis the bracts take an obliquely upward course, curving rapidl
the apex of the strobilus, until their direction is nearly vertical (Plate 85
The free limbs of the bracts were of great length, as is shown by the fact
transverse sections we may find as many as six overlapping whorls, proving
extreme vertical length of the bracts must sometimes have been equal to al
internodes, giving an extreme absolute length of perhaps 12 millims. *

The number of bracts in a verticil could not be determined with certainty
rently it was about fourteen in some of the smaller specimens, and not
twenty in the larger. From the position of the overlapping tips it appears that the bracts of sui
whorls alternated with one another.
