The
rate of cleavage and development, being inversely proportional to the egg radius,
must therefore vary with the ratio of the volume to the external surface of the whole
and not with the ratio of volume to combined surfaces of the individual cells. Since the ratio (volume)/(external surface area) seems to determine developmental
rate, the controlling factor is probably the rate of gaseous exchange between the total
protoplasmic mass and the total external surface of the egg or embryo. If this be so, then in spite of the fact that the intercleavage intervals remain
virtually constant as the blastomeres decrease in size, there should be an increase in
