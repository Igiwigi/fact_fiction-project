prior to their coming under genetic control. Moreover, while as we shall see, some
kinds of innovations may well be cognitively demanding, a basic capacity to inno-
vate is almost certainly phylogenetically widespread, as it depends only on
reinforcement learning: on an agentâ€™s capacity to register the environmental
state it finds itself in; register the response it has produced in that state; and to
evaluate the outcome of that response [2]. If innovating would often be adaptive,
and if innovation often depends only on capacities that are ancient and wide-
spread, then what explains the scope and limits of innovation in the animal
lineages, and the apparently significant differences in innovation between differ-
ent lineages? Our lineage is an especially vivid illustration of these differences;
our lineage is an extreme outlier. But though humans are an outlier, that may
not be a deep feature of our evolutionary history. One notorious and puzzling
fact about hominin evolutionary history is that between about 3.4 Ma and
250 kya, the pace of technological change seems to have been very slow [3].
It increased quite sharply between about 250 kya and 50 kya, and has increased
further since then (very obviously in recent times) [4,5]. The accelerating pace
of hominin cultural evolution seems not to be driven by a matching change in
the biology of humans. Indeed, in general, the technical history of hominin inno-
vation, and hominin expansion into new habitats, does not map in any clean way
onto speciation events in our lineage, or onto obvious changes in hominin
morphology [6]. That is even true of brain size and change in brain size.
