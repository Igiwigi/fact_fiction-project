The
continuity of the fibres of the second external layer at the base with corresponding
internal fibres, is strictly analogous to the continuity of the external fibres with the
internal ones at the apexâ€”the only difference being that at the apex the external fibres,
in order to become internal, involute or turn in, whereas at the base the internal fibres,
in order to become external, evolute or turn out. That the same principle which turns
in the external fibres and secures their continuity with corresponding internal ones at
the apex, also turns out the internal fibres and renders them continuous with correspond-
ing external fibres at the base, is probable from the fact, that the borders formed by the
union of the external with the internal fibres at the base and at the apex are convex, and
identical as regards structure ; in other words, the fibres composing both borders advance
spirally, the external fibres winding from above downwards and bending oyer the circular
edge, forming the apicial orifice in a direction from without inwards (Plate XII. fig. 11, kt,
and Plate XVI. fig. 55, ef), the internal winding from below upwards and bending over
the convex border surrounding the auriculo-ventricular or basal orifice in a direction
from within outwards (Plate XII. fig.
