counterpart), these limits also apply to our model. They indicate that for mg ~120GeV and
my ~ 60 GeV (as predicted by our model), the limiting cross section is only a few times greater
than the predicted one, giving hope that detection could be possible with the Run 2 data.

There is also potential for indirect detection through the emission of gamma ray lines from
XxX — vy, from the diagram of figure 6b. Unlike the tree-level annihilation x x — tt which is p-
waved suppressed, this process is s-wave, with (av) = 4 x 10~°° cm? s~1. This is not far below the
most optimistic constraint ~10~°° cm? s~! (depending upon assumptions about the DM density
profile in the galactic centre) from Fermi/LAT [49].

For direct detection, the cross section is unobservably small unless we allow for a small VEV
(s) at zero temperature. Then singlet-Higgs mixing gives rise to the diagram of figure 6c. Current
bounds from direct searches limit the mixing angle at the level 6; < 0.04. In fact, some small
amount of mixing is required for successful baryogenesis in this model, since if s > —s is an exact
symmetry of the scalar potential, then the early universe will be equally populated by domains
with s >0 and s <0 during the EWPT, containing equal and opposite values of the BAU that
will eventually average to zero. Only very small (Planck-suppressed) mixing is needed to avoid
this problem: lifting the degeneracy between the s <0 and s>0 false vacua before the EWPT
will eliminate the higher energy phase as long as the domain walls separating the two phases
annihilate faster than the Hubble rate. Hence, we do not expect that relaxing this simplifying
approximation will change our quantitative estimates of the BAU.

The model described in §4 is one example showing that EWBG, far from being dead, can be
