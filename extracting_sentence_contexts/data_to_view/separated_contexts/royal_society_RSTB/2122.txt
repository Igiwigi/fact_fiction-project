A. MAacMUNN ON THE GASTRIC GLAND

of Aplysia, and I arrived at exactly the same conclusion as recent observers who
have worked at the same subject in other Mollusca, namely, that it is capable of
digesting fibrin in acid and alkaline solutions, and of changing starch into sugar. We have, in fact, peptic, tryptic, and amylolytic ferments present.*

I have not thought it necessary to describe in greater detail the other cell-
inclusions found in the above or other gastric glands, because FrEenzEt has, in his most
recent papers, done this so thoroughly that he has left little to be described. He,
however, draws, in my opinion, too hard and fast lines between the granular and
ferment cells. The Gastric Gland of Decapod Crustacea.—In those Decapod Crustacea which I
have examined I have found much less entero-chlorophyll or other pigment than
in the Mollusca.
