Introduction

We humans have the distinctive ability to form complex social interaction and
communication networks. These networks allow us to share information and
cooperate with each other, achieving more collectively than any single individ-
ual could by themselves. In fact, scientists argue that our ability to gather and
disseminate information about others is one of the reasons why we trust and
help each other: that is, reputational information promotes cooperation. Reputation is the information about someone’s past behaviour that we obtain
from direct observation, from centralized institutions (reputation systems), or via
social networks (gossip). In social dilemma situations where cooperation is indi-
vidually undesirable but collectively beneficial, reputation allows cooperation to
emerge via indirect reciprocity or reputation-based partner choice [1].
