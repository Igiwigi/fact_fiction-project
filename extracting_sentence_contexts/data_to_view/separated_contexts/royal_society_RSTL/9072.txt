Summation of stimuli also greatly increases the amplitude of the contractions; s0 that it
both deyelops in the tissue a state of expectancy and arouses it into a state of increased
activity, My results in this connexion differ from those of Dr. BowpiTcn in that (Â«) the
medusoid tissue has a shorter memory for the occurrence of a previous stimulation than
has the cardiac; and (6) in the medusoid tissue a stimulus which at the bottom of a stair-

contraction of very nearly maximum intensity. This latter fact proves that the stair-
case action is, at any rate in part, dependent on the process of stimulation as distin-
guished from that of contraction. Moreover, that the effect is one pervading the
whole extent of the irritable tisses, is proved by another fact, viz. that when at any
stage during the construction of a staircase the electrodes are snddenly shifted to any
other part of the irritable tissues, the next contraction will rank as the next step in
the staircase.
