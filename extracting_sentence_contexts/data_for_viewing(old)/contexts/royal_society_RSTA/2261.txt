It is now obvious that a system that is non-contextual (or contextual) in the counterfactual
sense is precisely a system for which there exists (respectively, does not exist) an identically
connected coupling. The two meanings coincide. One can even say that the notion of a coupling
is nothing but a rigorous mathematical meaning of the ‘counterfactual sense’. Instead of making
the assumption, some would say distinctly metaphysical in flavour, that a random variable has a
definite value even if unmeasured, one can state as a fact, with no assumptions involved, that one
can impose a joint distribution on (construct a coupling of) all random variables in the system.
And then one can ask whether among all such couplings one can find an identically connected


one. Counterfactual statements can be rigorously formalized, but most would agree that their
logical status is more involved than that of factual statements. ‘The system has a coupling with
properties X’ is more ‘ordinary’ a statement than ‘Had we measured A in another context its value
would have been x’. As stated in a Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article [38], ‘Philosophers,
linguists and psychologists remain fiercely divided on how to best understand counterfactuals’.
It is hard to be divided over the notion of a coupling.

5. Hidden variables with context-independent mapping

As mentioned in §2, several random variables are jointly distributed if and only if they are
functions of one and the same random variable. Thus, because in each content c all random
variables Ry (q € Qc) are jointly distributed in the operational sense (measured ‘together’), one
can define a random variable H; and functions fq (q € Qc) such that (2.2) holds. This is a context-
specific hidden-variable construction, and it is obviously nonrestrictive, applicable to any system. :
