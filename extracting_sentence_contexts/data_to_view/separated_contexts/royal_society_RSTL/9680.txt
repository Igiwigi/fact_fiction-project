The terms in ?? are obviously equivalent to a change in m, the phase of the oscilla-
Stion; but the amplitude L is unaffected. We might have arrived ab this conclusion
= about the amplitude if, in solving the differential equations, we had neglected in the
T olutions the terms depending on ??, as will be done in considering our equations
EZ E below. In those equations, however, we shall not find that the terms in t annihilate
E one another, and thus there will be a change of amplitude.

& That this conclusion concerning amplitude is correct, may be seen from the fact that
