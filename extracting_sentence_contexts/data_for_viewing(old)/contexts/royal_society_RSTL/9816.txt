2, Econint,—(A.) Section of external surface of 8hell,—If a cork-borer be applied to
the external snrface of the shell of an ZEchinus, and rotated there till the calcareous
substance of the hell is reached, and therefore a continuous circular section of the
overlying tissues effected, it is invariably found that the spines and pedicellarie within
the circular area are physiologically separated from the contiguous spines and pedicel-
lariz, as regards local reflex excitability. That is to ay, if any part of this circular
area be stimulated, all the spines and pedicellarie within that area immediately
respond to the stimulation in the ordinary way ; while none of the spines or pedicel-
lariz 8urrounding the area are affected. Similarly, if any part of the shell external to
the cirenmscribed area be stinulated, the spines and pedicellarize within the area are
nob affected. These facts prove that the function which is manifested by these
appendages, of localising and gathering round a seat of stimulation, is exclusively
dependent upon the external nerve plexus. Tt is needless to add that in this experi-
ment it does not signify of what size or shape or by what means the physiological
island is made, 80 long as the destruction of the nervous plexus by a closed curve of
injury is rendered complete. In order to ascertain whether, in the case of an unelosed
curve of injury, any irradiation of a stimulus would take place round the ends of the
curve, we made sundry kinds of section. Ib is, however, needless to describe these,
for they all showed that, after injury of a part of the plexus, there is no irradiation of
the stimulus round the ends of the injury. Thus, for instance, if a short straight line
of injury be made, by drawing the point of a scalpel over the shell, say along the
equator of the animal, and if a stimulus be afterwards applied ou either 8ide of that
line, even quite close to one of its ends, no effect will be exerted on the spines or
