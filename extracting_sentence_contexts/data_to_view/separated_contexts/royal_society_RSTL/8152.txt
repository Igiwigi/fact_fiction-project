Our history of what is known of this remarkable plant is not yet exhausted. On
examining the fine series of coal-plants in the Liverpool Museum, which owes 80 much
to the ever-vigilant energy of the Rey. H. H. Hic6xs, of Rainhill, I detected a series of
cortical impressions which evidently belonged to an arborescent tree, and which I at once
identified as having a probable relationship to my Dictyoxylons. On naming this cireum-
stance to Mr. CaRRUTHERs, he called my attention to the fact that a specimen similar
to the Liverpool ones had been described by the late Mr. Gove, of Glasgow, under
the generic name of Lyginodendron. Dr. BRYCE, of Glasgow, kindly furnished me with
Mr. Govnrr's memoir, which at once satisfied me that the Liverpool specimens were

< varied forms of the Lyginodendron Landsburghiz of the Scotch author. Mr. GouRL1g gave
