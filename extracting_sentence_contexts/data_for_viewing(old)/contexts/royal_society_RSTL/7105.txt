When the large capillaries of the papilla are distended with transparent Prussian-
blue injection, their walls are seen to be of extreme tenuity and transparency.  Con-
mected with the transparent tissue are numerous oval masses of germinal matter (nuclei),
Which are separated from one another by very short intervals. Some of these masses
qojoct slightly from the ifiner surface of the vessel into its interior, but the majority
Seem to be upon its external surface. Of an oval form, many of these latter gradually

per into thin fibres which are continuous with the tissue of which the vascular wall is
Eonstituted. The delicate membrane constituting the vascular wall exhibits longitudinal
Sriw, which are probably produced in its formation, and by its external surface is con-
Feeted with the delicate connective tissue which forms, as it were, the basis-substance
"af the papilla, and intervenes between all the important tissnes which are found in it.
his is proved by the fact that the vessel is moved when the transparent connective

'> The most interesting point I have observed in connexion with the anatomy of these
Fessels, is the existence of very fine nerve-fibres. These form a lax network around the
Sapillary. I have traced these fine fibres continuous with undoubted nerve-trunks in
Many instances, and have followed the latter into the trunks of dark-bordered fibres,
Zrom which the bundle in the papilla is derived. A similar arrangement of fine nerve-
Abres has been demonstrated in connexion with other capillary vessels of the frog.
Lhese fine nerve-fibres are very distinct in several of my specimens.
