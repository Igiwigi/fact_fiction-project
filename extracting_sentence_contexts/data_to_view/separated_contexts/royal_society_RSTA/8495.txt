We have stated the problem in its simplest
possible form: only one parameter is required, the middle point of the distribution.

By the method of moments, this should be given by the first moment, that is by the
mean of the observations: such would seem to be at least a good estimate. It is,
however, entirely valueless. he distribution of the mean of such samples is in fact the
same, identically, as that of a single observation. In taking the mean of 100 values of
x, we are no nearer obtaining the value of m than if we had chosen any value of « out
of the 100. The problem, however, is not in the least an impracticable one: clearly
from a large sample we ought to be able to estimate the centre of the distribution with
some precision ; the mean, however, is an entirely useless statistic for the purpose.
