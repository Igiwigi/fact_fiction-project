very slight step from Zamia to the method of fertilization in all Conifers hitherto
described (except Gingko), where fertilization is completely siphonogamic, the pollen
tube making its way through the neck of the archegonium and carrying the
generative cells directly to the oosphere. Taking this into consideration, and also
the fact that the fertilization of Conifers has been worked out in detail in such a
small number of cases, it is quite possible that antherozoids will be discovered in a
number of other forms. Even if Gingko remains the only representative of the
group, with actually motile antherozoids, it seems not improbable—unless we are to
suppose that disappearance of cilia has taken place co-temporaneously with the attain-
Rent of perfect siphonogamic fertilization—that cilia in a functionless condition, or,
és least, traces of them, will be observed in some of the generative cells of Conifers.
will be interesting to see if any trace of the structure called by WepBerR (42) a

fAter in the immotile cells of the Conifers. It is this important structure which
fives origin, as Betaserr (32-35) has shown, to the ciliary band in the Filicines,
Eauisetines, and Characee ; WEBBER (40, 41) also has described and figured most
@early the development of the ciliary band from it in Zamia, and Hirase and
eae (36) state that it performs the same function in the antherozoids of Cycas and :
