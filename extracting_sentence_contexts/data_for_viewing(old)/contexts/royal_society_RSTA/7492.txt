These two expressions, evaluated numerically by means of the X tables, are equal, and by
theorem 2, part IV, the eigang terms with corresponding eigang values can be equated
so that it follows

ABO(e) CO(d, m, +m) = ~ Y(f,d)/X(d, m, + my, e, c,m,) ALBCO(f)] O(d,m,+m,). (16)

But these coefficients are just the U(a,b,c,d|e, f) by the definition of the latter.

Values of these coefficients are given in table 2, where it will be seen that a numerical
check is provided by the fact that each subtable represents an orthogonal transformation
and so different columns are orthogonal.

The W coefficients are used in one of the most fundamental relations for the reduction of
Schr√©dinger matrix elements between vector-coupled functions. They were defined by
a formula involving a double summation of products of X coefficients, but it is simpler to
evaluate them by a modification of the relation in which they are used, and which was proved
to be a consequence of the definition. This is
