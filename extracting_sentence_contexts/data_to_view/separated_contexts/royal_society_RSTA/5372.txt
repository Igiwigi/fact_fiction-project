We are also inclined to think that a trace of acidity in the solutions is useful in
preventing the formation of the grey deposit ; on this point also we are continuing the
work.t The slight acidity in time corrects itself by its action on the zinc. The
important fact remains that the formation of this grey deposit must be, as far
as possible, prevented, and, if it does form, the deposit must be removed. The experience of Dr. Scuuster with regard to this grey deposit somewhat
resembles our own. He has kindly sent us the results of measurements of a set of
rather large cells prepared from commercial sulphate.
