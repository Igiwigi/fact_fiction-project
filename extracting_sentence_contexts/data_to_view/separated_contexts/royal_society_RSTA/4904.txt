It is an interesting thought to
consider that had a single wavelength really been involved as originally thought by Laue, then
Braggâ€™s Law shows that with a stationary crystal it is highly unlikely that it would have been
satisfied and X-ray diffraction would not have been discovered when it was. Laue would not
have received his Nobel Prize, nor probably would the Braggs in 1915! Now the reason why I have mentioned this early work of Laue is because in fact, to his credit,
he was not completely wrong in his assertion that secondary radiation was, or better could be,
involved. It is just that the techniques available at the time would not have enabled this to be
observed. An excellent account of the history of this period in the field of crystallography can be
read in the book by Authier [11].
