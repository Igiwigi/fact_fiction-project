For TM 50, the model and experiment substantially disagree, although the
observed diffusivity shows the same trends as the other experiments, increasing quickly at high
¢. These differences could suggest additional, or non-DLVO, interactions. The modified Carnahan-Starling equation proposed by Peppin, Elliot and Worster ([9, eqn 17]
matched asymptotic solution between Carnahan-Starling at low ¢ and molecular dynamics
simulations at high ¢) does also turn back upwards at large volume fractions, and in fact diverges
near random close packing (¢ = 0.64). However, if this compressibility factor, Zp, is used in place
of equation (2.15), there is no noticeable difference in the response below about ¢ = 0.60, as
demonstrated by the dashed line in figure 8a. It cannot account for the observed increase in the
effective diffusivity of the colloidal particles in the range of ¢ = 0.4 to 0.6.
