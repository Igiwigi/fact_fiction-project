Confirmation of the accuracy of GraHAm’s views as to the co-existence of liquid:
and gaseous molecules ina solid, was afforded twenty years later by Professor”
W. Sprine.|| In 1886 his admirable investigation on the solidification of alloys
of lead and tin, afforded him experimental evidence that in these alloys active mole-
cular movement is continued after the alloys have become solid. He says, and it
is well to quote his interesting words, “on serait. porté & penser qu’entre deux molé-
cules de deux corps solides il y a un va-et-vient perpétuel d’atomes,” and he adds, “if
the two molecules are of the same kind, chemical equilibrium will not be disturbed,
but if they are different this movement will be revealed by the formation of new:
substances.”

Formation of Alloys by Cementation..—The fact that alloys can be formed by the
union of two metals at a temperature below the melting point of the more fusible
the two has long been known to metallurgists, and perhaps the most striking
in the more modern history of the subject was recorded in 1820 by FarapaY
