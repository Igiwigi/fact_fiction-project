It would be an
advantage if the magnification of such instruments were greater than that described
in this paper, say 80 instead of 20 (see Appendix). Subsequently this instrument
might be replaced by a seismograph with larger amplification and longer natural
period, so that it would record distant shocks and any relatively local shocks in
greater detail. A great advantage of having established centres of seismographic observation in
the Leeward and Windward Islands would lie in the fact that it would be possible
to begin observations of any seismic activity in any one of the islands, of a similar
character to that which has taken place in Montserrat in the past few years, at a
much earlier date in the history of the episode than has been possible in the recent
instance. Had the instruments been established in Montserrat 12 months earlier than
was actually the case, a great wealth of observations would have been made available. Jaggar shock recorders could be quickly, and at relatively small expense, transported
from one island to the island nearest to the centre of the disturbance.
