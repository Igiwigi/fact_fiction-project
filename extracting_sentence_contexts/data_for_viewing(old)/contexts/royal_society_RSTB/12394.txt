the genome and the evolution of populations are difficult to
pursue.

Most estimates of mtDNA MRs are based on the so-called
indirect or phylogenetic methods, where the number of
nucleotide differences in (putatively) neutral regions of the
genome is counted in two lineages with a known divergence
time. The number of changes observed is then divided by the
number of possible loci and time (either absolute time or
number of generations) in order to calculate a rate. This is
not, in fact, an estimate of the MR, but is instead an estimate

of the substitution rateâ€”but the distinction is rarely made in (b)
the general scientific literature. While the substitution rate
can be a good approximation of the MR if substitutions are a
neutral, perhaps unsurprisingly, the substitution rate can be ws 2
