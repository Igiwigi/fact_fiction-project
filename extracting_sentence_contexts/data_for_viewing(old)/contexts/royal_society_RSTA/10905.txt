* During the experiments for the determination of the liquidus, described in a previous paper (‘ Phil.
Trans.,’ A, vol. 189, p. 50), the cooling alloy was sometimes stirred by means of a hand stirrer during the
freezing-point experiments. On such occasions we noticed a marked difference between the precipitates
formed a little above and a little below C; above © the solid forming was soft, and we compared it to
mud, but as soon as the temperature C was reached the precipitate became hard and gritty, and we
compared it to a sharp sand,


THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COPPER-TIN SERIES OF ALLOYS. 18)
Below the lines Ab/edef, E,H’ and H’K’ the alloys are wholly solid, if they have

been cooled with extreme slowness; we have succeeded in verifying this fact, but,
unless great care is taken to ensure slow cooling before the chill, alloys chilled a little
below these lines, which together make up the solidus, will be found to contain
liquid at the moment of chilling.

Classification of the Alloys into Groups.
Vertical lines through the points B, L, C, D, E, f£ G, H, I, divide the alloys into

groups having special qualities. We will trace the complete cooling of an alloy from
Such group.
