CarHart and GuTHe used the same instrument for measuring the current as was
employed by Parrerson and GuTHE in measuring the electro-chemical equivalent.
It consists of a torsion electro-dynamometer in which the movable coil is wound on
ebonite. In addition to the difficulty in measuring with the required accuracy the
mean radius of a coil of the size employed (radius 5 centims.)|| there is the further
objection that the coil was wound on an ebonite reel which was by no means of
constant size. Thus Carnarr and Gurue found that the shrinkage was sufficiently
great to warrant them in giving a set of measurements made only four days before
the measurements of radii only half weight. For the above reasons the author does
not consider that these observations are of as much weight as those of RAYLEIGH or
Kante. Rayxeren’s cells were prepared under very much the same conditions as
those of GLAZEBROOK and SKINNER, who, as a matter of fact, took one of RAYLEIGH’S

|| To obtain an accuracy of 1 part in 10,000 in the E.M.F., the mean radius must be known to within
00005 centim.
