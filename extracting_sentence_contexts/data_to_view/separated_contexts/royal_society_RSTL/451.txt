264, Count de BouRNoN's Description of

FRACTURE AND TEXTURE. I have already observed, that all the stones which compose
the various kinds of this substance, to which I have given the
general name' of corundum, have a lamellated texture, in a
direction parallel to the faces of a rhomboid'of g6* and 847; and
also, that they break in a direction parallel to the said faces,

The blue variety of perfect corundum, or sapphire, follows
the above law, as well as all the other varieties. It is true,
however, as I have already had occasion to mention, that the
ease with which the crystals of this substance may be divided,
is very various ; but observation shows, at the same time, that
these variations are governed, in the first place, by the degree
of force existing in the attraction of the molecules which com-
pose the crystals, as well as by the perfect adhesion of the
crystalline lamine (composed of these molecules) at all points
of their surface; two facts; the existence of which is shown
by the difference. in the degrees of hardness and transparency of,
this stone, and which appears to. be very.
