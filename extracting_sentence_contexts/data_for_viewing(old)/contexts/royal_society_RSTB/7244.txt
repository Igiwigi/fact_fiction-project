of these is considerably elongated. Another one, also lying free, is of uncertain orientation.
Three of them are fused to one side of the split residual embryo. In these there is a
notochord all the way along one side of the split, terminating posteriorly in a primitive
node behind the split and anteriorly in the mass of partly free tissue of the excised-piece.
The most reasonable interpretation is that the node, included in the original excised-piece,
has functioned almost normally by retreating down one side of the split in the axis. These
excised-pieces are probably elongated, but their extent cannot be ascertained because of
confusion with residual embryo tissue. One of these specimens was a control, while in the
other two the original polarity of the reversed-piece has been converted to that of the
residual blastoderm.

The excised-piece in these experiments therefore frequently develops only neural tissue
and mesenchyme, in spite of the fact that it contains node tissue. This may often be a non-
specific effect of its isolation from the residual blastoderm. Even when well healed however
into the head region of the latter, the node tissue still does not develop according to its
presumptive fate, but forms head-like structures instead; which suggests a direct influence
of the residual blastoderm. Sometimes, especially when laterally fused to the chordal level
of the residual embryo, it may form its presumptive axial tissues; in some cases probably
rather more than its presumptive tissues, since somites appear from what is supposed to be
presumptive notochord.

IX. OPERATION TYPE AND DIFFERENTIATION

A preliminary analysis of the different kinds of differentiation appears in ยง III. It now
remains to supplement this analysis in the light of the data subsequently presented, and
