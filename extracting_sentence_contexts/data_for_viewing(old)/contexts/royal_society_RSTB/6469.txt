general ectoderm through the fibrillar system of the ectodermal hood. Orally, they
are in connexion with the fibrillae of the radial cord. Of the two ectodermal folds
which together compose the hood (figs. 18A, 18B), the outer has a very much better
developed fibrillar plexus than the inner, and is provided with a correspondingly
larger number of primary sense cells.

It is characteristic of the azygos tentacle that its neurofibrillae are not arranged
along any particular axis, circular or longitudinal, as in the ambulatory podia. In
view of this fact, it is noteworthy that the fibrillar zoning of the radial nerve cord,

although extending to the distal limit of the optic cushion, does not extend into the
narrow strip of ectoderm which unites the cord and the oral surface of the azygos
tentacle.

6—The Optic Cushion and Optic Pits

We have already seen that at its distal extremity, where it underlies the azygos
tentacle, the radial nerve cord is expanded into an optic cushion (fig. 17, opt. c.).
