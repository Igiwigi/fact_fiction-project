and weak-to-moderate mean hourly intensity, this storm type likely belongs to the long-lasting
family. In this context, it is relevant to note that both CanWE#3 and #5 are strongly phase-locked
onto the diurnal cycle of the solar forcing with initiations and maximum intensity from mid- to
late afternoon. From that point of view, it matches the usual diurnal cycle during break periods
[29]. By contrast, for CanWE#4 and #6, the maximum intensity usually occurs after midnight



but the diurnal cycle is less pronounced than for the ‘convective’ CanWEs, as seen in [53], and
matching also what is seen during active monsoonal periods [29]. So, CanWE#4 and especially #6
may be related to larger-scale structures conveying moisture (either when the monsoon is fully
set or where orography or orientation are optimal versus the moisture flow) enabling convection
across larger and longer scales. The fact that CanWE#4 and mostly #6 are more frequent during
the core phase of the monsoon, when the large-scale low-level monsoon flow takes place and can
sustain longer and larger WEs, seems to confirm this interpretation. Future studies examining
the dynamical and thermodynamical environments of the CanWEs are needed to support this
hypothesis. In particular, the possible modulation of CanWEs due to synoptic-scale LPS and
tropical cyclones, or regional-scale intraseasonal oscillations, needs to be deeply explored.

The CanWE framework may also be useful in predictability studies. The seasonal prediction
of rainfall associated with the boreal summer monsoon across India is a difficult task [54-58] due
partly to the large impact of a few extreme days [59,60]. We may hypothesize that CanWE#3 and
#5 are more difficult to predict than CanWE#4 and #6 given their spatial extent and duration. The

fact that CanWE#5 is responsible for most annual maximum hourly rainfall also poses a serious : =
