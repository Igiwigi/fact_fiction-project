(14) Single Layer Coils. Effect of radius of curvature of Coils.â€”A single layer circular
coil, whose width of winding is small compared with the radius of the coil, differs only
slightly from a straight parallel wire system, so that formula (53) will hold for a coil of
this kind as a first approximation. The slight differences which occur, due to helicity
of winding and owing to the fact that the wire (regarded as a cylinder under the
action of a transverse field) is curved, are probably too small to be measurable and
the mathematical difficulties too great to make a theoretical treatment possible. A more important difference is the modification of the transverse field acting on the

individual wires. In a straight single layer system the field acting on one wire is per-
pendicular to the surface of the layer, but in a single layer coil not only is this normal
field modified but there also exists a component of the field acting along the surface of
the layer.
