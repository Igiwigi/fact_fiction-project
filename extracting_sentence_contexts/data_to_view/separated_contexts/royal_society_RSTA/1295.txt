Hence, the relative
error was 0.5%. Thus, despite its increased complexity, the two-model approach to reconstructing parametric
force-displacement dependency exhibits its high accuracy. The above example also demonstrates
the fact that the properties of slopes of force-displacement curves discussed in Section 3 are
applicable to FEM calculations as well. References
