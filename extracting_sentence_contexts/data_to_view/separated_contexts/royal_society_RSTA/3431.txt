Figure 6 (from [51]) shows the required pre-SN mass-loss rates
derived for a number of interacting SNe, as compared to mass-loss rates of known types of stars
(from [1]). While some of the lower-luminosity SNe Hn could be explained by the dense and
slow winds of the most extreme RSGs and yellow hypergiants, many interacting SNe seem to
be consistent with CSM that has been created by LBV-like eruptive mass loss. This does not
necessarily mean that all LBVs are poised to explode as SNe within the next decade—in fact,
many LBVs have massive shells that are centuries or millennia old—but it does mean that LBVs
may offer a valuable window into the eruptive instability of SN In progenitors.

(b) Variable speed and density of circumstellar material

Rather than arguments based on the amount of CSM mass, LBVs have also been identified as
possible SN progenitors based on variability in the CSM speed or density structure. Trundle et al.
[52] noted that the two component absorption troughs in some SNe IIn resemble features seen in
line profiles of the LBV AG Carinae, where the two velocities are thought to arise from the star
crossing the bistability jump. The modulation of the radio light curves of some SNe IIb suggests
density variations consistent with what may arise from changes in wind properties during the S
Doradus cycles of LBVs [53].
