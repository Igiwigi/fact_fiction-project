matter began to accumulate in s8uch parts at that period, when the tides in them
were first checked, or otherwise affected by the rising of the land ; and that the chan-
nels were finally closed at their present levels, solely from the long interval during
which the sea acted at such levels. Hence, also, we might have expected, that
patches of alluyium would occur (as is the case) on the sides both of the land-straits
which are, and those which are not connected with shelves at corresponding levels.

From the leyels taken by Mr. Macrzax with Sir Lauper Dick, it appears that the
upper limit of the Glen Gluoy shelf, which coincides with the division of the waters,
is twelye feet higher than that of Glen Roy. The intervening space is nearly a mile in
length, moderately broad, and very flat, having only a fall of the twelve feet; and Sir
Lavver $tates* that he saw in this part the surface of the solid rock in the bed of
the little stream. These facts seem at first to indicate that two periods of rest had
superyened, one when the water stood at the leyel of the Glen Gluoy shelf, a second
when at the upper level of Glen Roy after a rise of twelve feet, and that, nevertheless,
the effects of these two periods of rest were confined respectiyely to separate, though
closely adjoining glens. This circumstance if 80 interpreted, althougl improbable in
