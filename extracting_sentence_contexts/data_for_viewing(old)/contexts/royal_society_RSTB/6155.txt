wider. If we regard A as a fixed point, then the most obvious way for length
accommodation to occur is by movement of B along the winding to E ; the original
substance of the wall must then be pushed in front of E along the direction of the
spiral winding. This has no effect on the steepness of the spiral, but it has the
effect of displacing points in the wall. For instance, C, D, which were at the centres
of two opposite walls, are now displaced to C’ and D’. Now any such displacement
would be recorded in the wall of the tracheids cut off from the cambium. But
structural features of this wall, such as the pits on radial walls and the trabecule,
or bars of cellulose, which sometimes traverse the space of a tracheid from one
tangential wall to the other, are extraordinarily constant in position. The pits are
always on radial walls, their borders never overlapping the tangential walls, whilst
the trabecule run in a very straight radial line through a radial file of tracheids.
These facts are contrary to a method of growth of the wall which involves a continua!
spiral displacement of its substance.

The only alternative method whereby a cell can increase in length with no
alteration in girth is that indicated in fig. 8. The inclination of the fibril alters so

as to accommodate the increased length of A B. Since now B moves vertically
upwards to B’, therefore C moves vertically upwards to C’, and D to D’, and we get
no lateral displacement. If now the inclination of the spiral to the cell axis be 0,
the girth of the cell 6, and the length corresponding to one turn /, then,

l= )bcot 0.
If /’, 0’, be the corresponding quantities for the elongated cell, we have
