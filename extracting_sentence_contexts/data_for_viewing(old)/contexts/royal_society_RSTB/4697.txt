Here again there is an indication of only a small degree of protection, if any.

In these cases, and others like them, it will be seen that a relatively short interval
elapsed between the desensitisation to the anaphylatoxin and the test for,sensitiveness
to the specific antigen. In a number of other experiments we found indications of a
far greater loss of specific sensitiveness, and it was only a subsequent comparison of

our records which brought to our notice the fact that we had left a much longer
interval between the desensitisation to anaphylatoxin and the subsequent test for
specific sensitiveness to the antigen. If the interval was somewhat longer than the
above, a partial protection became obvious, as in the following :—

Guinea-pigs actively sensitive to egg-albumin, 17th day.

Lethal dose of egg-albumin—0°2 mgrm.

Lethal dose of agar-anaphylatoxin —between 1 and 2 c.c.
