We may now briefly review the principal results of the foregoing investigation, so
far as they may be expected to throw light on the propagation of seismic tremors
over the surface of the earth. Tt has been necessary to idealize this problem in various ways in order to render it
amenable to calculation. In the first place, the material is taken to be compact and

homogeneous, to have, in fact, the properties of the “isotropic elastic solid” of
theory. Moreover, the curvature of the surface is neglected. Again, instead of a
disturbance originating at an internal point, we study chiefly the case of an impulse
applied vertically to the surface.
