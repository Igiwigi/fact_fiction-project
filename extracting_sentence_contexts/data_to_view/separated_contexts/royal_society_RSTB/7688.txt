Yes, they are completely different enzymes;
they may have a different mechanism, but the product is the same. So what is generally conserved? I know for a
fact that what is conserved in the evolution of biochemical pathways is the set of reactions, the set of intermediates,
the chemical conversions, for example the Calvin cycleâ€”but the individual enzymes that catalyse those reactions
are completely different. A specific prediction of our model is, for example, that such fundamental processes as
amino acid biosynthesis or purine biosynthesis should be fundamentally different in the archaebacteria and the
eubacteria. Now, people are working on purine biosynthesis in archaebacteria, and one of the steps that is catalysed by tetra-
hydrofolate in eubacteria and eukaryotes is catalysed by a formate-dependent reaction in archaebacteria by a funda-
mentally different chemistry and a fundamentally different enzyme.
