The object of the present communication is to submit the
result of these observations to the Society ; and whatever
remarks I may be induced to make on the discordances be-
tween Dr. BrinKLEY's observations and my own, I hope,
will be considered rather in the light of suggestions, aris-
ing from circumstances obviously presenting themselves to
our notice, than as arguments to decide a question, which


Mr. Poxp on the parallax of the fixed stars. 161

I anxiously wish to keep open for future experiment and
investigation. The question of parallax in a theoretical point of view, is
scarcely of any importance, it is in fact one of mere curiosity. The motion of the earth has long since ceased to be a sub-
ject of controversy, and could a difference of opinion still be
supposed to exist, the advocates for the Copernican system
would derive but slender support from the discussion of such
small variations, as form the subject of this Paper. But with
reference to the state of practical astronomy the case is very
different ; in the future history of this branch of the science,
that period of time will always acquire a certain degree of
celebrity, in which astronomical instruments shall have been
brought to such a degree of perfection, as to exhibit distinctly
the effects of parallax in the fixed stars, and to distinguish
these from the variety of complicated oscillations to-which,
from other causes, they are perpetually subject: and, as far
as relates to the natural history of the sidereal system (if I
may 50 express myself), it is surely a subject of rational
curiosity to ascertain whether the distance of the nearest
fixed star can be numerically expressed from satisfactory
data, or if it be really s0 immeasureably great, as to exceed
all human powers either to conceive or determine.
