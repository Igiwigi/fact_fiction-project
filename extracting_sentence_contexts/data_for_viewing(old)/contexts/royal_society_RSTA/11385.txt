are sought of the fertility of mothersin mankind, the women will appear under their
husbandsâ€™ names, and the labour of ascertaining whether two sisters have been
included is enormous, when large numbers are dealt with. But if two or more sisters
have been included, their mother has been weighted with her fertility, and when we
seek the correlation between mother and daughter, it will be between mothers and
daughters when weighted with fertility. But a still more serious difficulty arises
from the fact that all records are themselves weighted records ; the same number are
not married from each family, hence we are more likely to find a member of a large
family included than a member of a small. The large families, when we seek a record of
Evo generations, are more likely to appear than small families. Precisely the same dithi-
qalty occurs when we are dealing with thoroughbred horses; a mare with large
fertility i is less likely to have all her offspring colts, or all her progeny sold abread,
game one or more will probably ultimately come to the stud, and thus mares of large
wertility are, @ prior, more likely to contribute to our fecundity correlation cards.
We do not get over this difficulty by taking the mother and only one of her offspring.
The record is still weighted with fertility. The practical verification of this lies
iB the experience that the fertility of mothers will always be found to be greater
@an that of daughters, although the fertility of the community may really be
igcreasing ; the weighting, of course, excludes sterility in the generation of mothers,
