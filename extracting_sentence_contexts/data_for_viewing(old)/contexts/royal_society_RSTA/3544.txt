hydrogen gas. As a result, they found a peculiar frequency dependence in FCG acceleration
in hydrogen gas; the ratio of hydrogen-induced FCG acceleration was gradually increased,
with a decrease in test frequency in the range of 10~0.1Hz, later reaching a peak at ~0.1 Hz.
Yoshikawa et al. [32] and Somerday et al. [33] also confirmed a similar frequency dependence of
FCG acceleration in hydrogen gas for a carbon steel and a pipeline steel, respectively. Figure 5
illustrates the relationship between the relative FCG acceleration ratio, (da/dN)}2/(da/dN)air,
as a function of test frequency, f, as obtained in AK-constant tests at AK=25~30MPam!/?
by Matsuo et al.

Regarding the frequency dependence, two possible mechanisms were proposed, one by
Matsuo et al. [31] and the other by Somerday et al. [33]. Matsuo et al. suggested that such a peculiar
frequency dependence is due to the difference in distribution of hydrogen concentration in the
vicinity of the crack tip, thus affecting the HELP process in the crack-tip zone. In fact, they found
that the degree of slip localization at the crack tip was strongly influenced by the test frequency
in JIS-SCM435, as shown in figure 5.

Subsequently, to complement the Matsuo et al. study, Yoshikawa et al. [32] investigated the
FCG acceleration in low-carbon steel under the hydrogen gas pressure, py2, ranging from 0.1 to
90 MPa, at frequencies spanning from 0.001 to 10 Hz. Figure 6 plots the relative FCG acceleration
