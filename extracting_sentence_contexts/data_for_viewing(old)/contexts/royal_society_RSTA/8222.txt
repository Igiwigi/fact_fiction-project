in this part of the departure from Darton’s law.

(6) BerkeLey, Harriey and Burron’s experiments on aqueous solutions of cane
sugar and methyl glucoside and calcium ferrocyanide, where they compare the
directly observed osmotic pressures to those calculated from the vapour density
ratios, show no difference in the results greater than 0-5 per cent. In these
experiments the maximum vapour density ratio is only 1-1, yet as the osmotic
pressure is proportional to the logarithm of this number it is evident that a
departure from Dauron’s law of 1 in 1000 would induce a discrepancy of 1
per cent. inthe highly concentrated solutions, moreover if we remember that the
relative departure from Dauron’s law would be more apparent for the high
concentrations we should expect the latter to show larger discrepancies, all in
one direction. As a matter of fact these discrepancies are somewhat less and are
not in one direction.

As regards Boyir’s law. Only a substantial departure therefrom will affect our
results ; for it must be remembered that we are comparing one vapour with another,
and presumably both will be similarly affected, hence the correcting factors will tend to
cancel out because they will appear in the numerator and denominator of the right-
hand side of equation (2).

Our experiments cannot show any such effect, except in so far as there is a difference
