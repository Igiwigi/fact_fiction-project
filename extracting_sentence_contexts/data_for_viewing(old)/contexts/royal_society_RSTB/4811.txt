of cells in the pericardial floor at about the level of the dorsal side of the gut. â€˜This
rudiment projects as a ridge into the perivisceral space. A lumen appears later in this
solid chain of cells, which becomes the cavity of the gonad. The formation of the oviduct
has not been followed, but from the position of the oviduct in the adult it is undoubtedly
formed from or in the pericardial floor.

The ccelom sac that grows downwards to surround the genital rudiment is earlier in
connection with the ventral mesoderm, from which develop the muscles of the first pair
of trunk limbs. The second ccelom pouch must clearly belong to the first trunk segment.
and hence, since there is only one pair of pouches between this and the mandibular
muscles, either the maxillulary or the maxillary pouches are absent or else they are
fused together. That the first dorsal pouch represents at least the maxillary pouch is
clearly established by the fact that the maxillary gland develops in connection with it.
Whether it also represents the maxillulary pouch cannot be stated for certain. It is a
very long pouch, being prolonged to end just inside the dorsal attachments of the mandi-
bular dorso-ventral muscles. In one series of horizontal sections that showed the dorsal
pouches most clearly, this anterior pair seemed to be slightly constricted, but this cannot
be taken as sufficient evidence on which to state that the first pair of pouches really
belong to two segments.

The first pouch obviously differs from the others in that its lower angle does not grow
ventrally to form the pericardial floor in the usual way. However, at an early stage,
before the dorsal and ventral parts of the more posterior mesoderm separate, the lower
face of this pouch forms a non-cellular membrane (fig. 16) that later becomes continuous
with the more posterior pericardial floor. Ventrally this membrane appears to end against
