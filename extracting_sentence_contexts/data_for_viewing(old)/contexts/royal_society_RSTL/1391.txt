time Mr. HUNTER was preparing to lay before the Society some
observations on the skulls of wolves and bears found in the
caves of the principality of Bayreuth, in Germany. Among
these, so great was the difference in the form of the skull of
the young bear and the old, that where the jaws had been
destroyed, it required the eye of an anatomist to determine
that the skull really belonged to the bear.

While engaged upon that subject, I was surprised to find
in the seal tribe, not only that the skull in the large species
from the South Seas, differed exceedingly in its appearance
from that of the smaller ones in the Northern Ocean, but that
the teeth were equally unlike. At that time the facts had
less importance ; the study of geology being little attended to,
the subject escaped my memory, till the recent strides made
by Cuvier, BuckLaAnD, and others, have induced me to re-
sume it.


24.0 Sir EvERARD HOME on the difference, &c.
