precaution to keep the incidence constant, a small change will sometimes cause the
entire disappearance of a crystal whose facets happen to be near the critical angle.
But, provided any portion of a crystal is shown bright in the photograph, any changes
in its outline or surface are certainly genuine, for light that catches the facets on
one part of thé crystal must necessarily catch all similarly oriented facets also.
Where, therefore, the same crystal appears in successive members of a series, the
photographs may be taken to represent its life-history accurately.

Another feature of these photographs. requires explanation. In figs. 18 and 19,
and more or less in most of the others, an irregular network of dark lines or channels
is seen to cover the surface, and these lines obviously have little or no relation to
the crystals. As a matter of fact, these lines are only found in specimens that have
been etched, and then annealed and re-etched. In such a case as figs. 3 and 4,
where only one etching has been applied, similar lines are seen to follow the inter-
erystalline boundaries. In that case they are simply “ corrosion channels” caused by
the action of the acid at the crystalline junctions. These channels are of compara-
tively great depth, and when such a specimen is allowed to re-crystallise, and is then
re-etched to develop the new crystalline structure, this second etching is rarely
carried deep enough to remove the old etched corrosion channels, and these remain as
a network over the surface, simply indicating the positions in which crystalline
boundaries formerly existed before the structure became changed. This view is borne
out by the observation that deeper etching will eventually remove all trace of this
network. In many instances these traces of the former crystalline boundaries are
very useful as indicating the nature and extent of the growth that has taken place.
