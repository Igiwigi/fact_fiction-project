In this connection it is very important to observe the real position and value of the
index finger. Thus, at centre 85 the march is very distinctly in the order of : thumb,
index finger, the other fingers, wrist, and elbow. So at this part, where, as we have
already seen, the index possesses some primary representation, it forms a distinct item
in the march, Further, it is most noteworthy that the wrist is invariably pronated in
the upper part of the region now under consideration, The importance of this fact
has already been alluded to in considering the necessary succession of movements in
the performance of the highly evolved actions of the thumb and index finger. At the same time, it is of great interest, in connection with the development

of psychical energy, to see that the representation of the shoulder does not proceed

lower than centre 83, while at the same time also the representation of the thumb

extends upwards to, but not beyond, the same centre. 238 DR. C. E. BEEVOR AND PROFESSOR V. HORSLEY ON THE
