This means
that the difference in the coupling of / and s affects the value of # but not ofa. In the present
case of a d-electron coupled to a 4D, core it is evident from figure 4 that quite the reverse
effect is present. In fact, all the series which arise from d,, are parallel to each other as are
those arising from d,,. Between the two groups, however, there is a large difference in slope. In other words, in this case the spin-orbit coupling of the d-electron produces a large differ-
ence in a rather than in z.
