This is no cause for alarm.’ Or, as Richard Feynman observed: ‘It is our responsibility
as scientists to teach how doubt is not to be feared, but welcomed and discussed’. Below I give a
very scant sample of such historical mistakes of different sorts, just to illustrate my point.

e It seems that none of the geometric proofs in the first books of Euclid, which are even
today merchandized as proofs in school Geometry textbooks, are proofs according to the
modern standards. Apart from the stated axioms, these ‘proofs’ refer to scores of unstated
ones, ‘obvious’ facts, pictures, etc. But, as we know from the current papers in Algebraic
Topology, referring to pictures you can prove essentially anything. For instance, that any
triangle is equilateral.
