the phenomenon is more marked ; we have mos indubitable evidence
of a continued rise and fall of the logarithmic decrement. This rise and fall would
probably escape notice, were we able to take the mean of as many oxscillations as were
taken with copper ; moreover, if we commence a fresh experiment altogether, we find
a total mean logarithmic decrement p_—_ within the limits of errors of observation,
with the previous one, [Note added Sept. 18, 1886.—T have since discovered the cause of this rise and
fall: it is due to the fact that it is impossible to ensure that the axis of rotation
always passes exactly through the centre of mass. Of course, if the wire were
perfectly flexible, and we could entirely avoid pendulous vibrations when we started
