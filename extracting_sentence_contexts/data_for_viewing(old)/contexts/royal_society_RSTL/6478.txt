of the lake would be at least 35 fathoms below the level of the sea. Yet, says Professor
Heer, and apparently on unimpeachable data, *it was a fresh-water lake.” The
country, then, must have stood at a much higher leyel than at present, or a barrier
existed between the lake and the sea. Unless, however, there have been very local
changes of level, the former hypothesis is disposed of by the fact that the Hempstead
beds are of fluyio-marine origin, and must therefore have been formed at a level much
below that which they at present occupy. A barrier, then, must have existed somewhere
in the present tidal estuary of the 'Teign, over which the surplus waters of the lake passed
to the ocean, or which, by its superior height, caused the waters to find an outlet in
