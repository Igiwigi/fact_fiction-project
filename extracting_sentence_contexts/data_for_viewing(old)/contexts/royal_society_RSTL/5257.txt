presence of a considerable quantity of moisture being also shown by the existence of
a partial stratum of cloud at the height of about 2500 feet. Between the heights of
4000 and 5880 the humidity decreased with great rapidity from about 85 to less
than 35, For a considerable space little alteration took place, with the exception of
a sudden increase at the height of about 9000 feet, which was confined to a stratum
of not more than 400 feet ; but as the evidence of its existence depends upon only
one or two observations it may perhaps be doubtful. From 10,000 feet to 12,300,
the hamidity gradually increased to about 90, which value it retained very constantly
through fally 4000 feet. After 16,500 feet there were considerable irregularities,
there being however a comparatively dry stratum between 18,000 and 19,000 feet,
which was followed by a decided increase in the humidity. These indications agree
well with what is stated in (\ 3. with regard to the occasional existence of cloud
above the height of 13,000 feet, and with the fact that at the highest point reached
a mass of cloud was seen at a short distance above. In this series we can trace the
existence of two distinct strata of moist air, besides a third, which undoubtedly
existed at a greater height, but which was not quite reached.

August 26.â€”As on the first ascent, the humidity steadily increased from the earth's

surface. Between the heights of 7200 and 8950 feet it also rapidly diminished
from 92 to 26. For some distance the variations were no greater than might be
supposed to arise from uncertainty of observyation in such extreme circumstances.
It will be remarked, on examining the curve of the tension of yapour, that whilst the
indications of ReGxauin's hygrometer did not differ much from those of the wet
thermometer at the height of about 11,000 feet, the difference became considerable at
