The
reason seems to be that melting can occur at the surface without having to overcome this energy
barrier, and a very simple thermodynamic argument supports the idea that melting of a surface
(i.e. of the outermost several atomic layers of a surface) could occur below the bulk melting
temperature. In particular, melting at a surface replaces a solid-vacuum interface by a solidâ€”melt
interface and a melt-vacuum interface, but the sum of the free energies associated with these two
interfaces, ysm + Ymv, is commonly less than that of the single solid-vacuum interface, y (or ysy). Melting may, therefore, be energetically favoured at a temperature below the bulk melting point,
despite the fact that the free energy of the melt phase is slightly higher than that of the solid ([49]
and references therein). Evidently, in this simple picture, the thickness of the melted layer would
increase as the temperature gets closer and closer to the bulk melting temperature. Of course, this
simple argument ignores any possible interaction between the two interfaces.
