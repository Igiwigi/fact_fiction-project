ascus, is of 80me width. The colour of the sporidia, when in their prime, or rather,
I think, just before maturity, is a bright golden yellow, which subsequently changes
to a clear brown tint, after which the gelatinous coat disappears. 'Their mean length Is
423th of an inch. The brown colour is precisely that of the spores of Prosthemium
betulinum, which latter plant I snspect to be an altered form of the Spheeria.

In the first place, Spharia 8iparia and Prosthemium betulinum are almost always
as8ociated in growth. Whenever the one is found, a very slight Search will usnally

enable the observer to detect the other; and although the mere fact of their growing
\ together would hardly afford any ground for suspecting a relationship between the
two, it is a circumstance which, taken in connexion with others, must be allowed to
be of considerable weight. But besides their companionship, there is a very strong
external resemblance between the Sphzria and the Prosthemium, 80 much 8 that it is
frequently impossible, without a microscopical examination of the fruit, to decide whether
a particular specimen belongs to the one or the other. The perithecia of the Pros-
themium are large and depressed, with a central ostiolum, and, although not invariably,
are sometimes clothed with the dense wool which is one of the characteristics of the
â€”Spheria. There is, no doubt, a total dissimilarity at first sight between the eight-
Spored ascus of the Sphzria and the fascicle of spores of the Prosthemium ; but there is
great difference, on the contrary, there is not unfrequently a strong resemblance,
