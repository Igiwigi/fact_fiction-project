The latter is almost invariably saturated as it
were with crystallized carbonate of lime of a brown colour and radiated structure ;
for notwithstanding the microscopical observations of Dr. CareenTeER and Professor
Owex, I think the evidence is in favour of the conclusion of the Dean or WesTmin-
sTER, that this crystalline condition has resulted from sparry infiltration, subsequently
to interment, into the cellular and radiated calcareons texture of which the osselet.
was originally composed*; in like manner as the crustaceous coverings and spines
of the Echinoderms in the Oolite and Chalk, are 80 saturated with calc-spar as to have
acquired the hardness and peculiar oblique fracture of the erystalline mineral matter. The facts above described appear to me to confirm the opinion advanced by Mr. C,
Pearce and Mr. CUNNINGToN, that the Belemnoteuthis is generically distinct from the
Belemnite.
