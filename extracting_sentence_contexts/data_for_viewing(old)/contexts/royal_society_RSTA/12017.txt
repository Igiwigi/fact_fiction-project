ef, the axis of symmetry parallel to the axis of the cylinder. Then, if the cylinder
be rotated, we shall have a series of grey tints from a darkish e to a lighter f.
Now, if we ask several hundred persons to select a tint which would result from
mixing the tints at e and f, we shall obtain a continuous frequency curve, falling,
however, entirely within the range e to f. Or, again suppose a frequency curve
obtained by plotting up the frequency of a given ratio of leg-length to total body-
length, or of carapace to body-length. Here the range must lie between 0 and 1,
It is not that other values are excessively improbable, they are by the conditions
of the problem absolutely impossible. Hence, it is clear that the curves obtained
by Professor Wrtpon and Mr. H. THompson in the case of shrimps, crabs, and
prawns, can only be approximately normal curves, even if it were possible for the
ratios to run from 0 to 1. But as a matter of fact, the possible range is very
much smaller. We may not be able to assert, @ priori, what it is, but for an
adult prawn to have a carapace 3 or yoyo of its body-length, or a man a leg
$ or 35 of his body-length, may be regarded as impossibilities ; they are abnor-
malities, which could hardly survive to the adult condition. Precisely the same
remarks apply to skull indices, and probably to the relative size of all sorts of
organs in the adult condition. We may not know the range, @ priori, but we are
quite certain that one exists, and it is a quantity to be determined—just as the mean or
the standard deviation—from our measurements themselves. We may take it that in
most biological measurements of adults there is a range of stability, so to speak,
organs not falling within this range are inconsistent with the continued existence of
the individual, with the assumption that he has lived to be an adult.* Nor is this
question of range confined to biological statistics. A barometric frequency curve
