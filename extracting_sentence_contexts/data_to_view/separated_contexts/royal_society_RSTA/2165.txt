In fundamentals, however, the theory can scarcely be questioned. It explains so
many facts and is so simple in itself that there seems no alternative but to accept it
in outline at least. [The principal facts which may be regarded as giving support to the theory may be summarised as
follows :—
(1) When » is just less than yx for any one of the heavier elements, the fraction of the primary energy

absorbed (K absorption) transformed into K characteristic radiation (E) is slightly less than 0°5. K,

(2) There is evidently a limiting value of about 0°5 for the fraction. (3) As » diminishes this fraction invariably diminishes.
