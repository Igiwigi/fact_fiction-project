is still a scaling function of tw but with scaling exponents a which decrease upon increasing €,.
We argue that the different results shown in figures 6 and 7 can be explained by noticing that
upon increasing €, we are changing the physical meaning of the event. This is because in the
e based definition of size, the term $(t¢(k) — t;(k)) is missing. Consider, for instance, a relatively
large event selected with the level-crossing at some value €,. Upon increasing ¢,. the initial time of
the event is shifted and the corresponding interevent time increases or event duration decreases.
This implies that t,, and S may acquire non-negligible correlations for large enough e,. On the
contrary, the scale invariance shown in figure 6 is based on the same definition of the event
regardless of the threshold Sy. It is true that the definition of event used in figure 6 is also based
on a threshold, namely ¢, however, looking at the interevent times for avalanches S > Sy, we
retain the same definition (i.e. the events for which ¢(t) > #) while neglecting the computation
of tw avalanches smaller than Sj,. Thus P[t»|S¢,] and Pltwlex] refers to two different statistical
properties of the system that are not related to one another. This example highlights the fact
that the scale transformation e, — A€, cannot be considered a coarse-grained transformation in the
