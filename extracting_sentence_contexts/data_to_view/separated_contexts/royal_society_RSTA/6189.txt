Consequently,
T* can be chosen bigger than T, and so we obtain (3.45) with T* replaced by T.

(iii) Limit in the entropy equality

Let us analyze the limit of (3.24) as n > +00 for each term. The strong convergence of #” and
V0", see (3.14) and (3.33), implies that n” > n and Vn" > Vn a.e. in Q. Thanks to the definition of
n", and the a priori bound (3.8), we obtain a uniform bound for ||7"||L"(q) for any 1 € (1, +00) and
for || Vn" ||,2(Q)- These facts, the Vitali convergence theorem and (3.2) allow us, up to subsequence,
to easily pass to the limit on the left-hand side of (3.24). To pass to the limit also in terms on the right-hand side, we use (3.10), (3.11), (3.14), (3.23)
and (3.45) combined with the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem and together with the
minimum principle for 0". Consequently, n satisfies entropy equation (2.11).


(c) Continuity of 2 in time

Finally, we focus on the attainment of initial conditions and continuity with respect to
time variable.
