As a result of their labours it is well known that
annealing is accompanied by a re-arrangement of the crystalline grains of the metal. Thus, when a piece of iron is strained in tension its crystalline grains become
elongated in the direction of tension ; but when the specimen has been subsequently
annealed by being heated to a bright red, all signs of such elongation disappear from
the crystalline pattern revealed by the microscope. In fact it is not generally
possible to find any definite connection between the crystalline pattern seen in the
same specimen before and after annealing. In general, the pattern seen after
annealing resembles that found in a similar specimen before it has been strained,
but the scale and character of the pattern produced depend very much on the
details of the annealing process, particularly upon the temperature applied, the time
of its application, and the rate of cooling. ARNotp and Sreap have shown that
prolonged annealing tends to produce large crystals in iron and steel.
