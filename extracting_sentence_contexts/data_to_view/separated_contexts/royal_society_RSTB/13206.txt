A similar correlation is
approximately one-third of TE sequences that lost DNA also observed for hypomethylated TE-containing alleles that
methylation in the ddm1 parental line were inherited from were generated using a partial loss-of-function met] mutant
that parent in the hypomethylated state across at least eight parent [28]. However, additional mechanisms, including his-
(and presumably many more) generations, thus revealing a tone deacetylation, are also involved in the reversion to the
large potential for bona fide heritable epiallelic variation in methylated state at a subset of RDM targets [29] and most
A. thaliana (figure 1a). The other two-thirds of parentally targets can in fact recover DNA methylation when this path-
hypomethylated TE sequences regained wild-type methyl- way is compromised for just one generation [22]. These
ation progressively, within three to five generations [26], reverting TE-associated epivariants are preferentially found
and in either some or all of the epiRILs that contain the cor- within the pericentromeric, TE-rich regions of chromosomes
responding ddm1-derived chromosome intervals (figure 1b) and are characterized by relatively high levels of residual
[20,27]. This comprehensive survey thus revealed that epi- CG and CHG methylation, even when the sRNA-producing
variants at TE-containing alleles differ greatly in their arm (Pol-IV) of the RADM pathway is defective [22].
