There are consequently no eyelids, and eyelashes are absent,
and there is no trace of a nictitating membrane. The cornea is flattened in a
horizontal plane, as in the Seal, and indicates a similar high degree of astigmatism. No doubt the Cetaceans have a similar contrivance to the Seal, enabling them to see
both in air and water ; in fact I found, as in the Seal, an extremely thick lens having
an anterior spherical and a posterior parabolic surface, with a very highly developed
ciliary muscle.

VIIL Ropentra. (Plates 17-22.)

With the exception of the red and white Flying Squirrel (PÃ©eromys magnificus),
the fundus of which bears some resemblance to that of the Skunk, and the Spotted
Cavy (Celogenys paca), which latter has a fundus not unlike that of the Tapir, the
Rodents show no sign of a Tapetum lucidum. They all have fundi which are uniform
in colour, showing various degrees of transparency.
