That the increase in the conductivity of the eggs in the alkaline sea-water is due
to a removal of the effect of the cerium ions, and not to the secondary effects of the
cerium ions themselves, is shown by the following facts :-—

1. The increase of the conductivity in the alkaline solution is much too rapid to be
accounted for bythe secondary effect of the cerium ions.
