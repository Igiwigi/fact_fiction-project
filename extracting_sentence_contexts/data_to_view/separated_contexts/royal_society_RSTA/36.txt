The uncertainty, which we already had
before the red line event, has not been changed. After considering these simple scenarios, we could argue that the presence of information
reduces uncertainty. If an information event were to augment uncertainty, then in fact this
information adds to dis-information, ie. the opposite of information. A formal definition of
information can be given by the so-called Fisher information, I, defined as J(/P)(dP/dx) dx,
where P(.) is the pdf on noise ‘x’ derived from Xobs : Xobs = X0 +X. Hence, in scenario 2’, the red
line event creates more noise, and thus augments uncertainty.
