and similarly for p.

Figure 2 shows normalized plots of a-wave speed and attenuation coefficient for the
same composite as used for figure 1. Now, s=iw and |k| =—ia(iw). The severe divergence of
the different estimates above about 0.3c;/a shows the necessity of exercising some judgement
in the choice of p9. Smaller density contrast would of course give smaller divergence. Figure 3
gives the same information as figure 2, for the B-wave. It can be shown that, as w — 0, the estimate
of the B-wave speed tends to (u/, 'po)'/? while the estimate of the attenuation coefficient tends to
1/a for any po. Any estimate for the B-wave is correspondingly subject to uncertainty. At least,
however, the £-wave attenuation is much greater than that for the a-wave, for w smaller than
about 0.3c;/a and this tends to confirm its minor role at low frequency. The fact that it remains
