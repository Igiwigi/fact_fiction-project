equality with that of the atmosphere. On $hutting the other cocks and opening the
gauge-cock, the gauge was then ready to show any change of volume which the
supervention of the magnetic force might cause; but to give it the highest degree of
sensibility, it was necessary previously to make the liquid cylinder travel right and
left of its place of rest, that the tube might be moistened on each side of the indi-
cating fluid ; an effect easily obtained by inclining the chamber to and fro, the gravity
of the fluid making it pass one way or the other. But this and many other necessary
precautions as to position, temperature, &ec., can only be learned from experience.

2733. When this box was in its place, it stood between the poles of the great elec-
tro-magnet, with the plane of the gas-chamber in the equatorial position ; then square
blocks of soft iron, resting on the magnet poles, were made to abut and bear against
the sides of the box, 80 that in fact the inner faces of the air-chamber were the vir-
tual magnetic poles, and being 3 inches square were only #th of an inch apart.
Hence, whatever air or gas was within the chamber, would be subjected to a very
powerful magnetic action, and could have very small changes in its bulk measured ;
but it is perhaps necessary to observe, that it would be contained in a field having
everywhere lines of equal magnetic power (2463. 2465.).

2734. Air was introduced into the box, and when all was properly arranged, the
place of the indicating fluid was observed by a microscope. Then the magnet was
rendered powerfully active, and there appeared a very slight motion of the fluid, as if
the air were a little expanded ; on taking off the magnetic force the fluid returned to
