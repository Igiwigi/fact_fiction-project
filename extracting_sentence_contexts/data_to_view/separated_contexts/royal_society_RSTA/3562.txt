Not only dust mantling but also dust erosion are processes that can strongly Dos
affect production rate ratios. Near perihelion, surface ablation of the dust mantle can [=
become important, which moves the interfaces of sublimation of molecular species closer : S
to the surface, and increases their rate of production and coma mixing ratios relative 2
to water [39]. This process is proposed to explain the strong increase in the column aed
density ratios of CO2, CH4 and OCS observed in 67P from Rosetta a few days after : _
perihelion [36]. : x
â€”A few observational facts might argue for a primitive diversity. Comet 73P/ DNS
Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, a comet in the carbon-chain-depleted class, underwent : 5
splitting events. If the depletion was just an evolutionary effect, from multiple perihelion 13

passages, we would expect it to be confined mostly to the surface and the interior would
appear typical.
