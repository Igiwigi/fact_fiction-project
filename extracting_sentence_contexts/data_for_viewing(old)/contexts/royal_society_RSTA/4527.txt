considered intrinsically complex. In fact, the exciting
fields of complexity, chaos and nonlinear science have
experienced impressive growth in recent decades.

Research topics not only include classical problems
in statistical mechanics, fluids, pattern formation, chaos
and dynamical systems (these have deserved a wealth
of attention), but they have also given place to
new interdisciplinary fields such as networks, social
dynamics, econophysics, theoretical neuroscience and
brain dynamics, granular media, biomathematics and
data science, among others. The present issue of
