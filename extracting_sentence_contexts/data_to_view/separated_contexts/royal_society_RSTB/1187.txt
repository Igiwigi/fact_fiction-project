2This anatomical juxtaposition of parts suggests to us that the pyramidal tract fibres
for the lower limb do not immediately end in the efferent corpuscles. Such a con-
fasion is in harmony with the experimental results now under discussion, for it is
aBreasonable to suppose that the excitatory process would be so entirely blocked
when proceeding in the reverse direction along a path consisting merely of two fibres
(at of the anterior root and that of the pyramidal tract) joined by a large corpuscle
stich as one of those in the ventral (anterior) horn. â€˜SBut we must not anticipate the facts which bear upon the mode of termination
ofthe fibres of the pyramidal tract, and must return to the question of the block
dered by the construction of a centre to the passage of nerve impulses. Ss
