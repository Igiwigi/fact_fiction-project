than the phenomena of inanimate nature bear to the propagation of an impulse along
a nerve? Do not a thousand inanimate agents excite the muscular fibre in precisely
the same way as the nervous influence does*? and it would be difficult to believe that

DR. PHILIP ON THE NATURE OF DEATH. 187

the agent which operates in the formation of the secreted fluids from the blood and the
other assimilating processes, is of a nature essentially different from that which effects
similar changes in the laboratory of the chemist, even if the facts to which I have
had occasion to refer had not been experimentally ascertained ; but these facts, bear-
ing more directly on the question, necessarily make a stronger impression.

Let us for a moment glance at those phenomena in which we are assured that no
inanimate agent interferes. It is evident that the organs to which impressions made
on the neryes are conveyed, must be those organs from which the nerves in question
originate and derive their power. The sensitive nerves must communicate the im-
pressions made on them to the sensitive parts of the brain and spinal marrow. It
therefore follows that the sensorial functions, consequent on impression made on the
nerves of the sensitive system, are the effects of the influence of the neryes on those
parts of these organs. What are the results of this action of one vital part on an-
other? Can we see any analogy between the phenomena of inanimate nature and
pleasure or pain, the excitement of the feelings, or of the powers of reflection ?
