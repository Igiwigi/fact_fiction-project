Now it is easy to see that the regions A, (0,) cannot be used as regions of acceptance.

In fact, it follows from the proposition III that the regions A; (a 1) could only be
used as regions of acceptance if, for any fixed value of 64 == 1645,..the probability
P {EcA, (0’;)|0’,,0.} were equal to « irrespective of what is the true value of 99. ae
at the last line of (71), we see that if a and 0, = 94 are fixed, the nig ee
P {EcA, (0’,)|0’;,09} still depends on 4 and that, according to the value of this
parameter, it may be smaller or larger than the prescribed «.

We see, therefore, that in cases where the probability law of the x’s depends upon

i ich it is desired to estimate
some more parameters, say 92, 93, - +» % besides 6,, which it is ;
