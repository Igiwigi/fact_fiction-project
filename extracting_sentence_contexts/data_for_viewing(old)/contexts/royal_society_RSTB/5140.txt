and absence of a vesicle. Copr, in 1892, made yet another generic name, Bematiscus,
using the presence or absence of a talon on the lower molars to divide those forms which
lack a talon, as Chrysochloris, from those with it. This remainder he divided into the
genera Bematiscus (C. villosa and C. trevelyani), with 40 teeth, and Amblysomus, with
36 teeth.

In 1907 Broom, who has had the opportunity of examining a large number of different
species, without using generic distinctions divided the family into two categories with
40 and 36 teeth, and subdivided these into further groups according to the index of
skull breadth and length and other characters.

In 1912, however, he showed that in C. namaquensis the species varied in its tooth
formula from 36 to 40, a fact which he considered to vitiate the classification into genera.

While it is conceivable that a survey of a much larger number of individuals might
still show a general cleavage of forms into those with 36 and 40 teeth, a reference to the
table on p. 280, which shows the distribution of the various characters, suggests, from
the way in which they are mixed up, that Dosson and, later, Broom were correct in
declining to accept generic distributions. Following them, and for similar reasons, the
single generic name Chrysochloris has been used throughout this paper.

While the shape of the auditory ossicles does not afford any help to support or define
the different genera alluded to above, its variation in different species is of considerable
interest from the evolutionary and physiological point of view, although an explanation
of the varying conditions found has yet to be discovered.
