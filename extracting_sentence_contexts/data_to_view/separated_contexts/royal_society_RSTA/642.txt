Some of the nuclei continued to grow but most
of them left the crystallizer in the overflow. The solids from the crystallizer after the 21 hr.
run are illustrated in figure 3. The seed grains grew but little; in fact only about 20 % of
the growth occurred on the grains. If, however, traces of Calgon were included in either
reagent solution (it was normally added to the sodium carbonate solution) nucleation
began at a later stage in the run and a greater proportion of the growth was on the seed
grains. Thus when Calgon was present at a concentration of 6 p.p.m.
