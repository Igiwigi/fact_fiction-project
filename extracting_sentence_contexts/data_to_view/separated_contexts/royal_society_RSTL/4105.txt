In common air, a deposit
of white oxide was precipitated upon the platinum plate ; in highly rarefied air (the
vacuum of an air-pump), a black deposit was formed : in both cases it commu-
nicated with the positive pole. An iron point being substituted for that of zine,
equally produced in common air a brownish red deposit of oxide of iron, and in
rarefied air a deposit of black oxide. I call the attention of chemists to these two facts, as well as that of the oxidation

of the platinum at a high temperature in rarefied air, They appear to prove the in-
fluence which the state of greater or less density of the surrounding oxygen may exert
on the phenomenon of oxidation and on the nature of the oxide formed. A plate *
and a point of soft iron were used as positive and negative electrodes, both in a va-
cuum and in the atmosphere,; the same results appeared with a plate and a point of
silyer, a plate and a point of copper, and a plate and point of argentane*#. The blue
light was perceived in all the experiments; coloured circles were likewise seen on all
the plates when they had acted as positive electrodes in rarefied air.
