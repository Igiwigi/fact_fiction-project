on both days, and on both there were no active Dimastigamabe when the samples
were taken. Again, there is evidence of activity during the time between the counts,
as Sample 362 shows a fall in both cysts and totals, so death is not likely to have
taken place until excystment and consequent activity had occurred, while Sample 363
shows a rise in cysts and totals, again implying that there has been an intervening
period of activity. There are numerous other cases where the same thing has
occurred, but in these the active numbers at the time of sampling are sufficient to
account for the bacterial changes.

From an inspection of the figures it is not possible to decide whether the inter-
action is primarily one in which the amoebe influence the bacteria or vice versd. The
possibility of the bacterial changes initiating those in the amcebee is, however, entirely
rul.d out by the fact that the contingency tables show no positive correlation
between the changes in numbers of the active forms in the two amoebae.


INVESTIGATION OF BACTERIAL AND PROTOZOAN POPULATION OF THE SOIL. 335

Prrtopiciry.

Preliminary experiments (8) had shown a remarkable periodic fluctuation in the
numbers of active flagellates in the soil, high numbers on one day being succeeded by
low, which were again followed by high on the third day. The extended observa-
tions here described have confirmed this phenomenon and have shown it to be
characteristic of only one species of flagellates, viz., Oicomonas termo (EHREN.). The
