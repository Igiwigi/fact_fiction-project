Even now the
limit is not that calculated for VD (2); there may be a small error in the latter, but
hardly to the extent of 200. We may feel as certain, however, that the limit and
VD (2) are the same as for the corresponding case of P() and VS(1), in which the
“error” is also considerable. The strongest evidence is in the striking fact that the
Dy and D,, series generate the doublet separation, For m = 2, 4 = 22920, which
would be far outside BerGMANN’s region of observation. The only lines now left unaccounted for in Cs are 13711 B, and 5209 R. The wave-
