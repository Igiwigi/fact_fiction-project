ares of the Indian Surveys, in combination with 35 latitude stations of surveys made
in other parts of the world. No attempt will be made here to obtain a new value of
the figure of the Earth by employing the whole of the Indian data instead of the
small portion used by Colonel Cuarke. All that is now aimed at is to set forth the
facts to be elicited from the operations in India which will be most serviceable for
future mathematical investigations.

The existing data may evidently be treated as they stand, in accordance with
either of the various methods which have been employed by Arry, Brssen, CLarke,
and others. But in all mathematical treatment of such data it is assumed that the
direction of the plumb-line at the astronomical stations is normal, or very closely
normal, to the surface, and wherever there is reason to suspect that this may not be
the case the station is arbitrarily rejected. Still, as a matter of fact, the paucity
of data has frequently led to the employment of stations which are sensibly influenced
by local attractions. It is possibly for this reason that some mathematicians have
been led to conclude from the data which they have employed that the mean fignre
of the Earth is not a spheroidal figure, with two axes only, as has been generally
accepted on theoretical grounds, but an ellipsoidal figure with three axes, two of
which are poles of the equator. This subject has been discussed at length in Arch-

deacon Prart’s ‘ Figure of the Earth,’ 4th edition, p. 181, with the conclusion that

“local attraction appears to supply a source of correction which makes a resort to so

peculiar an hypothesis as an ellipsoidal mean figure unnecessary and untenable.”
