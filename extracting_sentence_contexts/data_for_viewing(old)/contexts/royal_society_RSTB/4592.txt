in that they divide into three branches each of which passes to the eye. The deuto-
cerebron is placed just anterior to the protocerebron, and is formed very largely by
the antennary lobes, the dorsal lobes not being evident as distinct regions. The
antennary nerves do not present any special features. The tritocerebron comprises
the two tritocerebral lobes which are situated far apart from one another, and united
together by means of the post-esophageal commissure: From each lobe there arises a
composite nerve consisting of the fibres of the labral nerve (l.n.) innervating the
labrum, and the frontal nerve which passes to the unpaired ganglion of the same
name. Arising from the tritocerebron are the para-wsophageal connectives which are
directed nearly vertically downwards.

The infra-esophageal ganglion forms a pyriform mass and, beyond the fact that
paired nerves arise therefrom, it exhibits no outward indications of a paired structure.
The para-cesophageal connectives enter close together in the mid-dorsal line, and not
far from the centre of the ganglia. The mandibular nerves are large and stout, and
arise in close association with one another from the anterior border of the ganglia.
Nerves of the first maxillee and labium arise a little further posteriorly.

The ventral nerve cord does not call for any detailed description. The thoracic
ganglia lie one in each segment of the thorax, and from each ganglion a pair of back-
wardly and outwardly directed nerves pass to the legs of their segment. The
abdominal ganglia lie one in each of the first six segments. The sixth and last
ganglion innervates the remaining segments, and also gives off nerves to the anal
cerei and the genital organs.
