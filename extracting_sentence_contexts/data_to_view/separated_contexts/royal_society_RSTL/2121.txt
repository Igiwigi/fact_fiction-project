The malady was found, by examining the body after death,
to be inflammation. of one, of the conyolutions of the right
hemisphere of the cerebrum. In the microscope, the upper portion without colour con-
sisted wholly of globules £5 and 5 parts of an inch
in diameter ; the lower coloured: portion was entirely made
up of globules 355 and; parts of an inch in diameter. Professor BRANnDe, who examined the chemical properties
of these different portions, informs me, © that the upper por-
« tion had the usual properties of the albumen of the blood,
«« When carefully dried, it assumed the appearance and che-

« Jooser in texture and considerably softer, In dilute acetic
« acid it s00n became perfectly gelatinous, and was dissolved
«in it by the aid of a gentle heat, It contained a much
« larger relative proportion of water than the upper portion,
« and shrunk-much more when dried, in which state, however,
« jt resembled dried albumen. It appears that independent
« of colouring matter, these two portions of coagulum differ
« chiefly from each other in their state of concentration, the
« upper part containing more albumen, and less water, than
« the lower.”
