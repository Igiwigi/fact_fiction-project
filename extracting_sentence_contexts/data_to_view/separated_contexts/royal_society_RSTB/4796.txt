I will now endeavour to summarise the conclusions reached in general terms which
I hope may be comprehensible to the non-mathematical biologist. The conclusions
result, of course, from the assumptions, and simply exhibit their consequences. In
_ so far as the deductions do not agree with the known facts, the assumptions are probably
incorrect or incomplete. Ini so far as we find agreement, or the more nearly we find
agreement, the assumptions are probably correct. It is only by a full development of
the consequences that an effective test of the assumptions can be made.
