guished from its proper corpuscles. In Arenicola the blood-proper is exc]usively
aerated. The integuments bounding the visceral chamber are too dense to admit of any
agency of the surrounding medinm on the fluid contained within. Under such circum-
stances the physiologist must admit one of two suppositions. The chylaqueous fluid,

being a vital fluid, must in $0me manner be oxygenized. In this case this can happen

only mdirectly, either through the blood-proper, which 'in this species immediately
receives oxygen from without, or through the alimentary system, which is being con-
stantly traversed by a current of fluid-sand. 'These facts are here noticed in historic
connection with the chylaqueous fluid, because they tend to elucidate its peculiar
laws.

Between the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid in Nats filiformis and those of
Arenicola, a close resemblance is obseryable, -the same disposition to fibrillate on
bursting. The typical cell is orbicular in shape, nucleated and granular (fig. 16).
Another and more embryonic variety presents only a nucleus, the granules being
wanting. In Nais the chylaqueous fluid is colourless, and considerable in volume :
it is the © bed” on which the intestine moves. In the several species, of the genus
Nais, these corpuscles present very palpable diversities of shape, though not of struc-
ture. There are no external organs in this genus, either for the exposure of the chyl-
aqueous fluid or blood-proper to the aGrating element. As the latter is centrally
