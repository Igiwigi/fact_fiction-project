immediately by the forward suction stroke of the fourth and then the third limb.

The phase difference between the third and second limb is greater, but the second
limb does not move much in a backwards and forwards direction. Its movement is
mainly lateral, though the third limb appears to push it forwards at the end of its
forestroke.

The phase difference between the second and first limb is large, and, as the second
appears to move forwards very little, the fact which is most easy to observe is that the
first and third limbs move almost in opposite phase. Under low power it is possible
to watch the first and fifth limbs together and then it can be seen that these two limbs
move even more nearly in opposite phase.

These observations are recorded in fig. 19. It will be seen that, although there is
not true metachronial rhythm, yet the phases of limb movement appear to move
forwards.*

Now Moina possesses limbs of the same type arranged in the same manner as
those of Daphnia, and on morphological grounds it is considered as one of the most

* The meaning of the term “ metachronial” or “ metachronal” rhythm is not clearly defined and its
