that the term bilateral movement should be strictly confined to its simplest meaning,
viz., that in the execution of any definite muscular action or movement the muscles
of both sides of the body are involved, though not necessarily to the same extent, or
S that the muscles acting are of the same name. We would urge that, physiologically
5 speaking, the term bilateral movement can only mean simultaneous action of muscles
© on both sides of the body, and ought not to be used for the representation of those
©. muscles in the nerve centres. We believe that a certain degree of laxity in the use
of this expression has crept in by the employment of the word “ associated.” The
= term association connotes physiological co-operation and arrangement in the nervous
~, system, i.c., motor representation when the term is applied to movements. With this
6 view the expression “bilaterally associated movement” has been frequently used to
= characterise the activity of the trunk muscles. We showed in our Internal Capsule
“2 paper that this was not justified by the facts, since the somatic or trunk muscles
8 are as unilaterally represented, with the exceptions denoted in Table I., as are the
EB limb muscles. This point has been treated of late by Saerrtncron,* who has since
°8 shown that even the sphincter ani is unilaterally represented. Whatever may be the
"s physical condition, 7.e., movements of different muscles for the performance of definite
£ acts, there does not seem to be any ground for assuming, as has been so frequently
@ done, that certain muscles, e.g., those of the trunk, act in association, or that they
= are, therefore, bilaterally represented.
— Apart from the special physiological interest attaching to this question of bilate-
+ yrality, it is impossible for neurologists to correctly appreciate the pathology of epilepsy
S or the restoration of function when certain districts of the cerebral hemisphere have
- been destroyed until this question has been settled.
