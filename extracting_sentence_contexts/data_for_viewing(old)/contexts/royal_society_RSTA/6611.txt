The idea that natural systems, structures or materials may have design elements that
could be usefully applied to manufactured technology is old, and the transfer of these
elements into human technology has had several names (‘biomimetics’, ‘biomimesis’,
‘biognosis’ and ‘bionics’). In its simplest form, a direct copy, it is in fact ancient,
e.g. da Vinci’s bat-winged human-powered flying machine. Straight copies like da
Vinci’s are illuminating in that they are rarely workable, and highlight the need
for understanding of the underlying engineering principles. These principles must
be understood before the correct application area in manufactured technology can
be identified and exploited. For example, bat or bird-like wings are of no use for
human-sized flight but in fact may find use with the smaller flying robots (micro air
vehicles (MAVs)) currently in development. There is a duality between engincering
and biology which, although not immediately obvious, has considerable practical
value; they are both optimized (capital cost and fitness, respectively).

More modern attempts at biomimetics have transferred elements of designs rather
than simply seeking to make a direct simulacrum. Recent successful examples include
Velcro™ fasteners, the Eiffel Tower, stable wing planforms and layered ceramic com-
posites (Clegg 1998). Velcro was inspired by the design of microscopic hooks on bur
seeds attaching onto dog fur, copied in the hooks and loops on the fabric tapes. The
Eiffel Tower is said to have been inspired by the structure of cancellous bone in the
human hip, the trusses of the tower mirroring the trabeculae aligned along the axes of
the principal stresses. The stable wing planform designed by Ignaz and Igo Etrich in
