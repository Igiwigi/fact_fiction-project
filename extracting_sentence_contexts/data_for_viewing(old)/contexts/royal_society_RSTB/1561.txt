AND OVULATION OF MACACUS RHESUS. 149

epithelia cells, either of the surface or of glands, and he denies that these flat cells
are formed from the connective tissue cells below them.

There is no doubt KrersNowskt is quite right when he points out that much of the
new epithelium is derived from pre-existing epithelial elements, but that in itself is no
proof that all of it is so formed.

Duvatâ€™s observations, and my own, show that certain connective tissue cells are
transformed into epithelial cells, and I venture to think Krersnowsk1's observations
in no way disprove that fact. I would go further, and would point out that in many
of the figures which he gives, the epithelium is shown to be already a continuous
layer, and that it is not possible to determine from such specimens the actual origin of
the cells.

Again, in fig. 2, he endeavours to show the forward growth of flat epithelial cells
from cubical epithelial celis ; this he does show, as I have also shown it in fig, 82 of
my paper on S. entellus (No. 8); but there are in Krersnowsk1's drawing, also
superficial flattened cells which the author obviously intends to ascribe to this forward
growth, since he shades them dark as he has done the cubical epithelium ; but in my
opinion, it is by no means clear that these cells are derived from pre-existing epithelial
elements. The drawing is not very definite, and it stops short just at the point of
interest, but it shows enough to incline me to gravely doubt the interpretation
