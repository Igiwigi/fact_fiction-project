At J = 0, none of the spins are coupled and the eigenstates are trivially
localized product states with 17 = £1. Each 1’ state of the |-bits is doubly degenerate as the energy
is independent of the state of the central spin o. In anticipation of the leading interaction term at
non-zero J, we choose to work in a basis in which o points along or against the effective t/-
dependent field:

h(t) =] > ajr7. (2.4)

Thus, |sh,t) for s=+1 is an eigenstate of equation (2.3) with J =0, and, in fact, even for J 40
for B; =0. This set of ‘Fock states’ are naturally viewed as the vertices of an (N + 1)-dimensional

hypercube. We use the shorthand t = (tj,...,1/,-.-, Ty) and drop the explicit dependence of h on : =
t where it is clear from context. : =

The statistics of the effective field h play an important role in the dynamics of the model.
