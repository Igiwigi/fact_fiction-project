3. The expression found for the motion when there is a single source outside the
sphere enables us to deduce the velocity potential for a single sphere moving through
an infinite fluid. Taking the direction of motion as the axis of a, from which we will
suppose f measured, we may arrange a surface distribution of sources proportional to
cos 0dS and integrate over the surface of the sphere, or we may employ the simpler
method used in a paper in the © Quarterly Journal of Mathematies' for March, p. 128.
