And forasmuch as the only objection to the above hypothesis consists in its 8uppos-
ing the distinguishing property of nerve to be blended with the property of vicarious action in a high degree, I
cannot perceive any adyantage in again supposing these properties blended in another tissue-element. On the
contrary, any 8uch additional supposition appears to me quite unnecessary, and, if accepted, would certainly
8erye but to render the explanation offered in the text more complicated than it is. Moreover the fact already
alluded to in the text—viz. that tentative moyements differ in no respect from the accurately localizing move-
ments, except in their want of precision—this fact, I think, strongly tends to show that the same kind of
þ tissue-clements is concerned in the production of all these moyements.
