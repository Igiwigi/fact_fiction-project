of vibration are all the same. Hence each molecule 1s in that precise condition which
enables it to absorb most effectually the undulations emanating from its neighbours.
The rays from the particles at the end of the tube most distant from the pile have to
cross a space of nearly 3 feet before they reach the latter, this space being partially
filled with molecules circumstanced as just described. Hence absorption to a compara-
tively greater extent must occur; and indeed we can imagine the tube 80 long that its
frontal portion should furnish a vapour screen absolutely opake to the radiation of its
hinder portion. Comparing ether yapour with olefiant gas, it is, T think, evident that the
radiant points of the attenuated vapour which depresses the mercury column only 0-5 of
an inch, are further apart than those of the gas which depresses the column 30 inches.
Consequently there is a wider door open for the radiation of the distant ether particles
towards the pile than for the distant particles of olefiant gas. The length of the whole
column, in fact, might be available for the radiation of the vapour, and a part of it only
available for the gas. Cut off this unavailable portion from the gas column, and we do
not mjure its efficacy ; but cut off a sinilar length from the vapour column, and we may
materially diminish its effect. Speaking generally, by reducing the column of ether and
that of gas by the same amount, the diminution of radiation will be most sensibly felt
where the radiant points are furthest asunder. Reasoning thus, it becomes evident that
in a long tube the yapour may excel the gas in its amount of radiation, while with a short
tube the gas may excel the yapour. Let us now test this reasoning by experiment.

The dynamic radiation of the following four substances has been tabulated thus :â€”

Sulpharic'ether 64
Fame-ether L275 68D
