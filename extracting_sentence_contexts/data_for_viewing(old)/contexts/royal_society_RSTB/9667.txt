Gorge [2,3]; Isernia la Pineta [4] and Gesher Benet Ya’aqov [5]. The current
assimilation of an inter-disciplinary approach to prehistoric archaeology high-
lights exploration in percussive technology as a central research axis, not only
in lithic studies, but also in the fields of taphonomy, primatology, ethnography,
palaeontology and archaeozoology [6-8]. Traces on bones and stones are now
closely examined for their value as agents for deciphering percussion-related
activities carried out by our early tool-making and tool-using ancestors. Percus-
sive technology has been defined by Whiten et al. as: ‘...the use of tools to
strike surfaces and objects, their functionality deriving from the impacts
involved’ [7, p. 420]. Since the dawn of technology, percussive activities have
been carried out with ‘tools’ that today we commonly refer to by the generic
term: ‘hammerstones’. But, their morpho-functionality is in fact highly diverse
and little is known about their real uses. Hammerstones are an essential part of
most early stone toolkits, notably those allotted to the Oldowan (heretofore) or
