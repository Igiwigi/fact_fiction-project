Thus if Fg ({Iq(-)}) is any such functional, and fields {In(.)} are defined by (2.2), then
Fo({h(-)}) =Fe({I(-)}), with 2 =u(2). This search required discussion of the transformation
properties, induced by (2.2), of the various derivatives of the lattice vector fields, of courseâ€”
for example, det({Ia}) = det(Vu) det({la}) together with the definition n = d) - dz A d3 gives that
fyndV= Sven) ii AV is an invariant integral (where det(-) denotes the determinant and V C 2). In fact,

| n av, | Sn av, | d, - dx are invariant integrals, (3.1)
Vv 4 c

where C is a circuit, by recalling the definition of the dual fields {d,(-)} and the dislocation density
S, and by calculating relevant transformation properties. As mentioned above, if v is any elastic
invariant (ie. scalar differential function), then

{(I, - Vv)(-)} is a set of elastic invariant fields. (3.2)

As stated, if S has a least one non-constant component, then there is in general an infinite
number of elastic invariants, obtained from that particular component of S by successive


directional differentiation. This implies that there is an infinite number of integral invariants too, 8 |
because (for example)

| vd, - dx is an integral invariant if v is any elastic invariant. (3.3) 1B
c :

It was shown in the above papers that there is a basis of integral invariants in the sense that if 8
densities corresponding to the basis integral invariants are given, as fields in 2, then the densities

of all integral invariants can be determined.
