But on raising the
carrier to the position x the charge increased to 87*; and on raising it till higher to a,
the charge still further increased to 105®: at a higher point still, p, the charge taken
was smaller in amount, being 98*, and continued to diminish for more elevated posi-
tions. Here the induction fairly turned a corner. Nothing, in fact, can better show
both the curvyed lines or courses of the inductive action, disturbed as they are from
their rectilineal form by the shape, position, and condition of the metallic hemisphere ;
and also a lateral tension, 80 to speak, of these lines on one another :—all depending,
as I conceive, on induction being an action of the contiguous particles of the dielectric
thrown into a state of polarity and tension, and mutually related by their forces in all
directions.

1225. As another proof that the whole of these actions were inductive I may state
a result which was exactly what might be expected, namely, that if uninsulated con-
ducting matter was brought round and near to the excited shell-lac stem, then the
inductive force was directed towards it, and could not be found on the top of the
hemisphere. Removing this matter the lines of force resumed their former direction.
