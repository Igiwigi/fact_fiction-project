to Frank’s figures (‘ Botan. Zeitung,’ 1879, Plate V., esp. fig. 11) than the one he
then ascribed to them, though he has since retracted his explanation in a most
unaccountable way—erroneously, I am convinced.

It is still more difficult to accept Tscumcn’s assumptions as to the “ bacteroids ”
(gemmules) themselves. It may be true that their variable shapes militate against
their being bacteria, but bacteria are not the only alternative, as he assumes, and
these very shapes are fully in accordance with their being gemmules—tiny, yeast-like,
budding organisms—as a comparison of F’RANK’s figures and my own with those of
Tscuica’s amply testify, Tscutrcn’s assumption that the filaments (hyphee) dissolve,
and the protoplasm then breaks up into “bacteroids,” is certainly not true for the
tubercles of Vicia Faba. In fact, the whole of this purely hypothetical explanation ot
the nature of these bodies is contradicted by the facts observed in Vicia Faba; whereas
the phenomena are simply and naturally explained when we recognise that the hyphz
bud off the gemmules, which then multiply further by budding like tiny yeast-cells,
These then pass into a dormant state in the matrix, and escape into the surrounding
soil when the tubercles decompose at the end of the season of growth, and are there
distributed in readiness for contact with root-hairs of other seedlings in the following
season.

It now remains to examine the rest of Tscurrcn’s paper. He expressly states,
and repeats, that water-cultures are useless in the investigation, though no satis-
factory reasons whatever are given in support of this view. He admits that the
