That this is really the case,
is also proved, by my having seen specimens of this double sul-
phuret, (and chiefly among those that came from Cornwall,)
which exhibited several of the well known modifications of the
regular tetrgedron ; a circumstance that never takes place in the
octaedral sulphuret of iron, even when it happens accidentally
to contain a portion. of copper.*

* Though I do not admit that the above-mentioned yellow copper ore, is merely a
sulphuret of iron, with copper interposed within its substance, I am far from assert-
ing, that the last mentioned sulphuret does not sometimes contain a portion of copper
interposed within it ; but, when that happens, the copper is generally in much smaller
quantity, and its proportions are very irregular, insomuch that, in a hundred weight
of sulphuret of iron containing copper, the quantity of copper varies, from a few
ounces to several pounds. Besides, this sulphuret of iron, in the above-mentioned
circumstances, constantly preserves the external characters that are peculiar to it;
which, as we $hall hereafter see, are totally different from those of the yellow double
sulphuret. But, what appears to me worthy of remark is, that when this sulphuret of iron, thus -
mixed with copper, assumes a determinate form, that form is always one of those
belonging to the octacdral sulphuret of iron; whereas, when gold happens to be, in
the above manner, interposed within the substance of this sulphuret, it is always in
that Kind which assumes the form of striated eubes, or in that dodecaedral modification
of the above form which has pentagonal planes,

The constancy of the aboye facts, sufficiently shows that they are not owing to

Among the above forms, there is one in particular, which has
not yet been described as belonging to this sulphuret; namely,
the dodecaedron with rhombic planes, and also the passage of
the tetraedron, more or less advanced, towards this dodecaedron,
by each of its solid angles having been replaced by taree planes,
Situated upon its sides. This dodecaedron, which is by no means
common, even in Cornwall, (the only place where I have yet
met with it,) is found there of a pretty considerable size, being
Sometimes an inch, or even more, in diameter. This form has
never yet been observed among the sulphurets of iron.
