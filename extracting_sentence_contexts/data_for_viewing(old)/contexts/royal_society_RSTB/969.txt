is a causal one, receives support from the behaviour of corresponding primary, seconda
and tertiary nitrites. The secondary and tertiary bodies are the most active, aj
are also the most unstable; in fact, on this account it is very difficult to pre

the carbon atom directly bound to nitrogen seems to be principally due, not to t
direct physiological influence of the substituted methyl group, but to the chem
instability which the introduetion of this group confers on the molecule. What t
exact nature of the chemical change is which accompanies the manifestation of t
physiological action it is impossible to assert for want of experimental data. It m
