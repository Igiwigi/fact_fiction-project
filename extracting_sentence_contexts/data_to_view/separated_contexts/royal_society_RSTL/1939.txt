There were two pieces, each about a quarter of

an inch in thickness, and exposing a surface on each side equal to about half
a square inch; these were placed upon platina plates, one connected with the
machine and electrometer (419.), and the other with the discharging train,
whilst a fine platina wire connected the two pieces, resting upon them by its
two points. On working the electrical machine, it was possible to open the
electrometer leaves about two thirds of an inch.

422. As the platina wire touched only by points, the facts show that this
salt is a far better conductor than ice ; but as the leaves of the electrometer
opened, it is also evident with what difficulty conduction, even of the small
portion of electricity produced by the machine, is effected by this body in the
Solid state, when compared to the facility with which enormous quantities at
very low tensions are transmitted by it when in the fluid state.

423. In order to confirm these results by others, obtained from the yoltaic
battery, one of one hundred and fifty plates, four inches square, was well
charged: its action was good; the shock from it strong; the discharge would
continue from copper to copper through four tenths of an inch of air, and the
gold-leaf electrometer before used could be opened nearly a quarter of an inch.

424. The ice vessel used (420.) was half an inch in width.
