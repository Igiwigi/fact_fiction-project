I have also obtained this result by direct development. It may be thought
surprising that the last term is now the same in both formule, notwithstanding the
difference in the earlier stages, but if the reader will go through the analysis he will
see how this has been brought about. The formule (69) and (70) also hold true when
s = 3 (as I have verified), notwithstanding the fact that P® is not to be derived from
38° by a factor,

The next step is the integration with respect to ¢.
