If however the planets were formed under similar conditions, then, according to
the present theory, we should expect to find the exterior planets now rotating more
rapidly than the interior ones. It has been shown above (se Table IV., note to \ 8)
that, on making allowance for the different degrees of concentration of the planets,
this is the cage. That the interior satellite of Mars revolves with a period of less than a third of its
planet's rotation is perhaps the most remarkable fact in the solar system. The theory
of tidal friction explains this perfectly,* and we find that this will be the ultimate
