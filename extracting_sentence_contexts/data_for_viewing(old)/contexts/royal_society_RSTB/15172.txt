In early 2019, wood haulers alerted us to the planned clo-
sure of the public coal piles at the Kayenta mine, scheduled
and eventually executed in autumn of 2019. Study partici-
pants expressed deep concern about the implication of this
closure for people’s ability to meet their energy needs as
well as the potential impact of the likelihood that many
would make up the resulting shortfall by increasing their
demand for firewood or simply be cold. One interviewee
notes, ‘[...] how’s everybody gonna stay warm during the
winter now since there’s no more [coal]? [...] all we're
using is just the wood [...], and it’s okay but like, it doesn’t
stay on and stay warm for quite a long time.’ The interviewee
refers to the fact that many people rely on coal not only to
reduce their need for firewood, but to also reduce the
amount of fire tending required when coal is available.
Many use longer-burning coal in home heating appliances
overnight to ensure consistent heating while asleep.

We operationalized two aspects of this community exper-
tise into our ABM: (i) that full adherence to IEK involves the
harvest only of dead wood for firewood and (ii) that reducing
access to coal for home heating would increase demand
for firewood.
