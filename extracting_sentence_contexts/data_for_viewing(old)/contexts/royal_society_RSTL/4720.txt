In the Puma (Felis concolor), with the same vertebral formula, the common ac-
cessory tubercle indicates the anapophysis by its backward production from above
the diapophysis of the ninth dorsal (Plate XLV. figs. 5 and 6, @): the anapophysis
grows longer in the tenth (fig. 5, a); and in the eleventh the metapophysis (m) sud-
denly shoots upwards and forwards, the anapophysis (a) diverges from it backwards,
underlapping the metapophysis of the next vertebra, and both processes far snrpass
the diapophysis (4) in size, which clearly, however, coexists with them. It disap-
pears in the thirteenth vertebra, in which both ana- and met-apophyses have in-
ereased in length; and the only question that remains with regard to the * trans-
verse process ' (4) of the following vertebrz is, whether it includes the diapophysis
at its base, or consists solely of the connate pleurapophysis. The eleventh vertebra
permits of no doubt as to the distinctness of the diapophysis (4) from the two larger
superadded processes (32 and a), and, in fact, a rudiment of the diapophysis may
be recognized above the costal pit in the last dorsal. Fig. 6 shows the prozygapo-
physes (=) existing, as in all the anterior dorsals, independently of the metapophyses#:
fig. 7 shows them coexisting (2) with metapophysis (m), anapophysis (a), and diapo-
physis (4). The neural spine in this vertebra, which is the centre of motion of the
spine, is low and nearly vertical; the longer spines of contiguous vertebra converge
to it.

In the Hyena crocuta, with d 15, 15, the anapophyses begin to be distinet, and to
project backwards in the thirteenth dorsal, underlap the prozygapophyses in the first
three lumbar, and subside on the penultimate lumbar vertebra.

In the Welf (Canis Lupus) and Dog, with d 13, {7, the metapophyses begin to be
