28. The case in which the two invariants n’ and n/”

vanish simultaneously is of con-
siderable importance in the theory of the linear function. These conditions are
always satisfied for the functions 2f,=/f—//’; and also for functions of a more

general type; in fact, for functions whose squares satisfy a depressed equation
(PP + nif $= 0, or (PA P—s)=0 . . . (180). It appears from Art.
