The sum total of
the angular momentum of the earth’s atmosphere about the axis of rotation remains
approximately constant from year to year, and hence the moment of the couple acting
upon the atmosphere is on the average zero. The only forces that form this couple
are forces due to friction at the earth’s surface, for the mutual reactions of the
atmosphere as a whole cannot alter the angular momentum. From the fact that a
persistent wind produces a powerful ocean current we know that the frictional force
between the atmosphere and the earth must be considerable. Such a force is
persistently exerted in the region of the trades over nearly half the earth’s surface,
and is constantly acting so as to give an easterly directed momentum to the
atmosphere. It is balanced, as Ferret pointed out, by the westerly directed
component produced by the friction of westerly winds in temperate latitudes.
