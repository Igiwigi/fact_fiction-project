This investigation forms $T.; it is similar in every respect to that contained
in the * Philosophical Magazine,” but is much more complete. The corresponding
results for the equations (3) and (4) are deduced in { III. The fact that, in the solution in series of a differential equation, if the series
terminates but when continued recommences, the latter portion as well as the finite
series satisfies the differential equation, was pointed out by CavyLEy in the * Mezzenger
of Mathematics' for 1869. The formula (8) of $ V. was published in the * British Ass0ciation Report” for 1872,
with a brief account of the process given in arts. 20, 21, The principal portion of two

short papers, © On Riccarr's Equation” and © On certain Differential Equations allied
to Ricoatr's,” which were published in the * Quarterly Journal of Mathematics' for
1871 and 1872, are incorporated in $ VI. The memoir thus includes the results contained in several scattered notes and
papers.
