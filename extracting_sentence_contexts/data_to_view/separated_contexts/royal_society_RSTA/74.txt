In figure 10, we can see that the reconstruction is again pretty good even without additional
regularization. Also, the reconstruction for higher values is better than in the previous case
with constant technology. This is simply due to the fact that higher values for the capital are
present in the data (figures 2 and 9a). We can further smoothen the solution by adding Tikhonov
regularization, but as the original reconstruction is already very good, it does not improve the
solution too much. The behaviour for noisy data is the same as in the case of constant technology and therefore
we will not go into detail on this.
