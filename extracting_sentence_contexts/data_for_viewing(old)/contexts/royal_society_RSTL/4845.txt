Hence the value of the coefficient of extinction for the 'standard chlorine mixture at

Q@ C. and 0:76 pressure is 4,=0:01743, and its reciprocal 57-4.

S A negative value is obtained for the coefficient of chemical extinction calculated from
e results of Experiments XIV. and XV. From this we may conclude, that the rays
hich produced the action in Experiments XIV. possessed a different degree of refrangi-

Sls from those which acted in Experiments XV., and that from this reason the two

Sries of experiments are not comparable ; this view is easily explained by the fact, that

te experiments were made at different times.

2 'The conclusion which we draw from all our observations is, that the coefficients of

Ktinction of pure chlorine for chemical rays from various sources of light are very

"mgm The depth to which such light must penetrate chlorine at 0 and 0:76, im
