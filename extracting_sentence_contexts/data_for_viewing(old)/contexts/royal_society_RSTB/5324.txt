of the I, 3 plane of symmetry (* fig. 17, A, B and C indicates the ambulacra to which
these ocular plates belong). In the imago of regular urchins, e.g., Hchinus (GoRDON,
1926, a, figs. 16, 17 and 19d) or of Arbacia (fig. 3), the genital plates are symmetrical

{ The symmetry is complete except for the fact that column a differs from column b in the ambulacrum
through which the plane of symmetry passes—i.e., it is as complete as the arrangement of the ambulacral
plates in the corona permits. The same is true of the buccal plates; the two enclosed by the broken
line differ from each other, the remaining 8 are symmetrical about the II, 4 or the I, 3 plane,
