Instead, when including holiday and workday
trips (figure 3c), the distributions are mostly unimodal. This may be due to the inherent structure
of commuting trips, which dominate this network. In fact, commuting flows from a given origin
are relatively evenly distributed, because the chance to commute at a given distance decreases
with the distance [30]. Finally, the distributions including holiday and workday trips (figure 3a) are
bimodal, even though the bimodality is less pronounced compared to the case when weekend
trips are included. Importantly, we observe that the ‘lockdown’ does not affect the characteristic
shapes of the distributions substantially.
