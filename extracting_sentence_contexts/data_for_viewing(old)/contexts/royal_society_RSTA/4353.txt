frequency comb synthesizers, the other one makes use of a reference oscillator that is stabilized
against a Doppler-free molecular absorption line. Such a reference oscillator can be based upon
an ECDL, a CO} laser or a QCL, as recently demonstrated [79].

As for the thermometric substance, it is surely a matter of discussion whether it is more
advantageous to work with atoms or molecules. A low-pressure atomic vapour system, such as
Rb or Cs, offers the advantage of the simple structure of its absorption spectrum, when compared
with polyatomic molecules. Furthermore, collisional perturbations of the absorption profile can
be neglected, because the vapour pressure can be extremely small (approx. 10~4 Pa) [80,81]. On
the other hand, alkali or alkaline-earth metal atoms present other difficulties, including the strong
sensitivity to magnetic fields, the relatively large hyperfine structure and the occurrence of optical
pumping effects, which should be carefully accounted for, when modelling the absorption line
shape. As a matter of fact, most of the DBT experiments, performed more or less successfully in
the last decade, have probed an isolated line of a molecular species. In this respect, advantages
and limitations of the main experiments have been highlighted, also making a thoughtful
comparison among the different molecules. As a result, it seems clear that non-polar molecules,
possibly having strong absorption features in the NIR, should be preferred for many reasons:


collisions are less effective; the refractive index is smaller; moleculesâ€™ adsorption and desorption
from the cell walls are strongly reduced. This latter feature, in particular, makes it possible to
perform spectral averaging over long times, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio without
the risk of line distortion caused by a pressure variation arising from the interaction with
the cell.
