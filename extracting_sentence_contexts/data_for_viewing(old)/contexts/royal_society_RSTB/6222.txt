is “ statistically significant,” this means that even when one has allowed for the
inconsistency in the data, the difference cannot be accounted for ; so that one feels
justified in attributing the difference to the experimental conditions.

to set out the facts first, and to consider their physiological explanation later (p. 196).
The simplest type of experiment is that which delimits the conditions of
temperature and humidity which are rapidly fatal. From that we pass to the
duration of life of flies which may or may not have been fed, prior to the experiment,
and which are starved to death under controlled conditions. This leads finally to
the most elaborate, and perhaps most valuable, type of experiment, in which flies
are put under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity in a container,
from which they are removed daily in order that they may be offered food.
