The event-size distributions of the 2D model exhibit behaviours a
bit different from those in 1D. It exhibits a GR-like power-law behaviour for smaller magnitudes,
which changes over to a more characteristic behaviour for larger magnitudes. In fact, such a
change of behaviour, i.e. the GR law holding for smaller magnitudes but a significant deviation
from the GR law at larger magnitudes, has been reported also in real seismicity [55-57]. The computed rupture-length distribution also exhibits some difference between in 1D and 2D. In particular, the maximum rupture length L;,max is considerably longer in 1D than in 2D.
