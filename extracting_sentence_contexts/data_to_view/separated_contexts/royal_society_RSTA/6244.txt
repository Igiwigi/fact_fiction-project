In this paper, I present the current state of observational evidence for the southward spreading
of LSW anomalies in the DWBC structured around these two requirements. First, I review recent
advances in our understanding of how LSW is exported into the DWBC from its formation regions
(§2). In this section, I also reconcile the fact that decadal variability in LSW formation is reflected in
the Labrador Sea’s DWBC with the fact that LSW formation does not impact subpolar overturning
strength. I then synthesize the literature on LSW spreading into the subtropical North Atlantic
and suggest that water mass anomaly tracking, anthropogenic tracers and Lagrangian studies
generally agree on LSW transit times in the DWBC (§3). Finally, I discuss the connections between
LSW spreading and the AMOC, which remain uncertain (§4), and end with a final synthesis and
outlook (§5).
