considered, selecting two typical wind—wave states for operational and parked states. The main
results can be summarized as follows.

(1) For the fixed FM, in both Tripod and Jacket, moment demand at the tower base and axial
force demand at the pile head in load cases LC1-LC2-LC3, as well as moment demand at
the blade root in load case LC3, increase significantly with respect to the corresponding
demands without earthquake loads, even for moderate PGA.

(2) For the flexible FM, in both Tripod and Jacket, moment demand at the tower base
and axial force demand at the pile head in load cases LC1-LC2-LC3 do not change
significantly with respect to the corresponding demands for fixed FM, whereas maxima
moment demands at the blade root in load case LC3 increase significantly. This is
consistent with the fact that, as a result of the foundation flexibility, maxima tower top
