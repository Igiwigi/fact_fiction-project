A well-developed visceral system based on the same plan as that of a cypridinid ostracod
is present. This is largely associated with the musculature of the oesophagus.

A group of three nerves leaves the anterior face of the brain and run to ganglion-like
structures each containing a pair of large cells. It is suggested that these represent the three
constituents of the nauplius eye. The median of the three nerves probably also represents
the frontal nerve (figures 15 and 16).

The large nerve—the corono-lateral—leaving the sub-oesophagal ganglion laterally,
which has previously been described as the nerve to the adductor muscle, supplies the
upper musculature of the mantle and its main stem ends in Darwin’s muscle. It is connected
to the adductor muscle by a minute strand of one or two fibres only and it is suggested that
this muscle is, in fact, an independent effector organ (figure 17).
