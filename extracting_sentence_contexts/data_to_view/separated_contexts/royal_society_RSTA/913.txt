We formulate the precursor for extreme waves by utilizing the projection of the wavefield to
this wave-group with critical length scale, L*:

x—-—xXx

Yo(x*, t) =2L* (sech ( Ee -) U(x, o) , (3.6)

where the factor 2L* is a normalization constant. In figure 6c, we present the conditional PDF of
the maximum wave elevation in a future time instant within a prediction window extending from
t; =50 to ty = 350, given the magnitude of the precursor |Yo| at the current time instant. The fact
that the high-likelihood unstable mode is localized in space also allows for the determination
of the neighbourhood, x*, where the extreme event will occur in the near future. Note that
compared with the OTD method the precursors based on the highest-likelihood unstable mode
provides with longer warning times. This is because OTD modes need a small amount of time to
align to the currently most unstable modes.
