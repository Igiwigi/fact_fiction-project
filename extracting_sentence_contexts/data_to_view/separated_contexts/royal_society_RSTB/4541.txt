As usual there was no breaking
point between the last segment of the anterior regeneration and the first of the original
segments. It is very probable that the anterior regeneration is complete, though it
is just possible that another section of four segments remains to be regenerated, since ,
there are often five sections of four after the three threes. The fact, however, that
there is no marked growing zone between segments 22 and 23 favours the view that
regeneration is complete, as does also the fact that the worm recovered and remained
alive for two months, at the end of which time there were no additional segments ;
segment 22, the last of the anterior segments, being considerably reduced and only
detected with difficulty: The four original segments could still be distinguished. Specimen No. ;
