where K,, is the matrix reciprocal to ¢;;,,k;4. By changing to the dimensionless integration
variables J; = k;r, where r is the distance from 0 to x, it is easy to show that wu,, is the product
ofr! anda function of direction. Since uf is in fact the actual displacement u;*in regions where
S,, = 0, this verifies the vanishing of F;° assumed in $7.

For the type of internal stress we are considering the assumption (27) follows immediately.
The energy of a body subject to external and self-stresses p;4 and /5 differs from the sum of
the energies it would have if pf or p§ were present separately by the interaction term

pin; = 0 on the surface. The second interaction term cannot be treated in the same way,
