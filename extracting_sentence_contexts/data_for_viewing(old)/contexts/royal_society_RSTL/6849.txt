8. Of the ganglion-cells of the heart.

Although the description given in this paper will apply to the ganglion-cells of ganglia
in different parts of the frog, including those distributed to the heart and lungs, I feel it
necessary to refer particularly to the cardiac ganglia of the frog, because KGLLIKER has
recently made some very confident statements with regard to the structure, arrangement,
and action of these ganglia, which my observations fail to confirm. Nor is the differ-

A ence between us one of interpretation ; we are at variance as to actual facts. With
8 reference to the ganglia of the heart this observer says, * It may be particularly men-
E tioned that the origin of nerve-fibres from unipolar cells, and the rarity of the double
= origin of fibres, may be especially well seen in one place, namely, in the septum of the
& heart of the frog, where also R. WAaGxER admits the fact. .. .. . Here als0 we may most
Treadily convince ourselves that there are many apolar cells without processes, as is most

But in his Croonian Lecture last year, his opinion as to apolar cells has become
