To a minor degree
and with less consistency (4 of 6 groups) the same holds for the hallux,

Relative Amount or Degree of Representation of Extension compared to Flexion. This subject may not be without interest to those who have, from excitation
experiments, attempted to gauge the relative amount of functional activity in the
cortex. The facts bearing upon this point obtained from the records of hinge joint move-
ments are so clear and unmistakable that they are of value. The following are the proportional rates of frequency as observed in the capsule.

The bearing of these facts obviously requires no further comment, and the more so
as they are but confirmatory of the results we obtained in our analysis of the cortical
representation of these parts.
