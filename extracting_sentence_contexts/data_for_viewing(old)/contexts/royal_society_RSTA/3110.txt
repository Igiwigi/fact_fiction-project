Two major achievements in global negotiations are likely to have a significant transformative
effect on the global development agenda for decades to come. The Sustainable Development

difficult, if not impossible, to achieve socio-economic gains if the environment, and threats such 2
as climate change, are neglected; and that promoting synergies and mitigating or eliminating [3
trade-offs among SDGs is essential for achieving this balance and for helping achieve the : a
temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. In this regard, understanding how the various SDGs (8
are interlinked is crucial to the formulation of good policies and more effective action and finance : 3
in support of implementation. 7S

One of the messages of this review is that the success of each of these two global agreements
will depend heavily on the other and on the capacity of countries to develop and implement
programmes of action to address their climate and development objectives in an integrated,
coordinated and comprehensive way. Institutions, policies, governance and finance will need
to play key roles in support of these efforts. Through their 17 global goals and 169 targets, the
