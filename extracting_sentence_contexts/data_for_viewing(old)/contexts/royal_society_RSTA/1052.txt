elastic ECM underlying the Drosophila imaginal wing epithelium has been degraded in a region at
the centre of the tissue. The consequent distortions are typically reminiscent of an elastic buckling.
Likewise, the tissue undergoes shape changes also analogous to the buckling of an elastic sheet in
conditions of local hyper contractility of the apical surface of cells by expression of a constitutively
activated form of Myosin (L. LeGoff 2018, unpublished).

In vitro cysts were recently developed with morphometric, physico-chemical and mechanical
properties which can be tuned easily (see figure 5) [116,117]. Here, epithelial cells are encapsulated
in hydrogel hollow micro-spheres whose diameter can be varied from few tens of micrometres to
millimetres. In the presence of ECM proteins anchored to the inner walls of the capsule, cells
proliferate, readily spread onto it and self-assemble into a closed spherical epithelium. This set
up gives a new opportunity to investigate epithelial growth with a prescribed curvature and
with variable parameters. The fact that one can vary the parameters, such as the stiffness of the
artificial ECM by tuning the composition of the hydrogel, is a unique opportunity for testing
specific aspects of the theory. Indeed, morphogenesis is a complex highly regulated sequences
of processes with a few degrees of freedom including the use of mutants. Using in vitro cysts


allows one to dissect the different potential morphogenetic events and to investigate the impact
of geometrical and morphological control parameters. Both systems are geometrically complex
to handle analytically, but being made of thin layers a lubrication analysis of the equations of
elasticity or viscoelasticity may be suitable [57,58].

Undoubtedly, these two model systems will be helpful to test many aspects debated in the field
of morphogenesis of tissues, such as dissipation, localization and stochasticity [118,119]. Even
