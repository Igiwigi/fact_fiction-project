Coulomb explosion products [CaOH]* + [HCNH]* or HCN neutral loss yielding [Ca(H,O}**.
Results are summarized in figure 9, where we show how starting from each TS we can have
trajectories leading to multiple products. In particular:

(1) When initiating trajectories at TSg we obtain both the IRC product [Ca(NH)?* +CO
and the non-IRC product CaNH2* + HCO*. This is an example of non-IRC dynamics,
showing that when the TS is excited, the path leading to other products is opened.
However, the final product distribution does not depend on how the energy is injected
(i.e. we have the same results when the TS is excited with the same amount of energy on
vibrational degrees of freedom or on external rotation, see details in [18]).

(2) When starting from TSc we obtain again the two pathways mentioned in point (1). In
this case, the fact that trajectories initiated with less energy than ZPVE also follow both
pathways strongly suggests the presence of a bifurcation. Furthermore, for this TS, the
way of exciting the system (vibrational versus rotational) has a drastic effect on the final
product distribution.

(3) When starting from TSp a complex dynamics is also observed. Both products
(i) [Ca(HO)]?+ + HNC and (ii) [CaOH]*+ + [HCNH]* are obtained. For both Eizaguirre
et al. [15] computed a multistep mechanism leading to these products, confirming all
the TSs and intermediates by IRC calculations. However, the trajectories leading to these
products do not follow the computed PES. Thus, again we have non-IRC dynamics. Here,
as the excitation energy on the starting TS structure increases, the product distribution
changes. However, there are no significant differences regarding where this energy is
initially located (vibration or rotation).
