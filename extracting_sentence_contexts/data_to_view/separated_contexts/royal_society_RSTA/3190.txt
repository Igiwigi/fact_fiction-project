When all the MgO data were used, we obtained values of 204(14) GPa and
4.4(11), respectively. This variation reflects the effect of non-hydrostatic stresses that increases the
scatter of the data (figure 1). In fact, our neon data in which ruby was used to determine pressure
also show a systematic deviation above 10 GPa and probably represents a similar effect as sample
bridging by the anvils, since the ruby Rj â€”R2 doublet remained well resolved up to at least 30 GPa. While the values of Vo are similar, the bulk modulus derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction
[10], powder X-ray diffraction [15] and neutron diffraction [9] vary in the range 200-300 GPa; this
variation has been attributed to varying starting stoichiometries and stress state of the sample
even during quasi-hydrostatic compression studies [2,17,19]. We also concur with earlier studies
regarding the axial ratio in the lower pressure range.
