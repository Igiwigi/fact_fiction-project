pared in the same way. Measurements :—Band y: 605 to 589. Band «: begins to
be shaded at 577, is black at 573, extends black to 552, is shaded off to 547; centre

[The bands y and 6 in the spectra are shown too dark in the figures—8 is, in fact,
barely perceptible. |

The general results of these spectrum observations may be summarised thus :—
Turacin, as it exists in the feathers, possesses two absorption bands, one of which,
a, is rather darker and less wide than the other, and is situated about the line D,
extending some distance on its more refrangible side ; the other band, 8, lies between
the first-named and the line 6. Turacin in alkaline solution always shows the same
two bands, the first being, as before, darker and narrower than the second, but both
bands are shifted towards the more refrangible end of the spectrum. When an
alkaline solution of turacin is weak, it shows the above-named pair of bands only ;
when its strength is increased, a third band, 8, faint but broad, appears near the
line F. But if some isolated and dried turacin be dissolved in weak ammonia water,
