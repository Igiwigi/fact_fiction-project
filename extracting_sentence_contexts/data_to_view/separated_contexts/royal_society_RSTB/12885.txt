Overall it seems that mon-
ture is somehow clearer. Indeed, rhesus macaques exhibit robust keys’ behaviour is better accounted for as an experience-based

Risk-seeking behaviour in experience-based studies can be experiments always involve trial-by-trial feedback. The sys-

demonstrating a stronger impact of past positive outcome in (mainly water or fruit juice), while human studies are realized
