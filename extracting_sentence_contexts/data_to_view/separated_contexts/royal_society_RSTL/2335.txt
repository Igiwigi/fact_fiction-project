The questions which then
arose were, whether the ether was formed altogether from the direct action of
the remaining alcohol and sulphuric acid in the mixture, or whether the 8ul-
phovinic acid might not also assist, or whether it might not be an essential
state of the elements intermediate between the mixture of the acid and alcohol
and the development of the perfectly formed ether. MM. Dumas and BovLay,
who have considered the same questions, or at least 8ome of them,—decide, that
the portions of materials which form ether, are altogether independent of those
which produce: s8ulphovinic acid: but the following facts prove in my opinion
the contrary of this conclusion.

3. A portion of oil of vitriol was selected for some comparative experiments,
and also some -alcohol of specific gravity 0.820 : five hundred grains of the
oil -of  vitriol precipitated by acetate of lead, gave 1500 grains of sulphate of
lead.

4. Five hundred grains of the oil of vitriol were mixed with five hundred
grains of the alcohol, and after forty-eight hours, diluted and precipitated by
acetate of lead ; only 616 grains of sulphate of lead were produced; 80 that
very nearly three-fifths of the sulphuric acid had become sulphovinic acid by
the effect of mixture, and little more than two-fifths remained to act as sul-
phuric acid upon the remaining alcohol, full two-thirds of the quantity em-
ployed.
