Digital
interventions, the report notes, need more development. Beyond this, the report has nothing specific to say about
the interventions [100,101]. Meta-analyses of the effectiveness
of different types of intervention for children with ‘special
educational needs’ [108], ‘learning disabilities’ [109] or of
‘fact-based dysfluency’ [110] fail to distinguish the different
types of learning disorder, so they cannot provide a basis
for personalized intervention strategies that is matching the
appropriate intervention for the learner’s particular problem. In particular, they do not distinguish between dyscalculia
and other causes of low numeracy. Randomized controlled trials with one digital game,
‘Number Race’, have also been promising with early school
children [111] and preschoolers [112], though these studies
are not specifically targeted at learners with low numeracy
or with dyscalculics.
