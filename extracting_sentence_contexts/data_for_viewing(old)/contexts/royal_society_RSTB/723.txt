predominant form in the so-called “ Ginger-beer Plant.”

Yeast B.
Mycoderma cerevisiae (Desm.). (Plate 12, figs. 1-6.)

Whenever the fermentations were carried on or finished with access of air, a dense
wrinkled skin (“mould”) formed at the surface; and, since this occurred, when the
air had to filter through sterilised plugs of cotton-wool, there can be no doubt as to
the origin of the fungus from the infection. It is the very polymorphic Mycoderma
cerevisiae of DESMAZIERES.t It is not a true Saccharomyces, for it does not form
ascospores, and differs in several respects from the true yeasts, in the narrow sense.
It might be a matter for surprise that I should have devoted so much attention to so
common a form were it not for the fact that such conflicting statements occur as to
its nature and properties, and that it was necessary to be sure of its relation to
the ginger-beer plant.

It is, indeed, one of the most variable of all the yeast fungi, and has been the
subject of several extraordinary statements as to the vagaries of these fungi.

It makes its appearance invariably in the latter stages of all the preliminary
cultures, and, in many cases, was the predominant form from the beginning.

I first had my attention attracted by it in the earlier cultures of 1887. On
November 16 of that year, a flask of Pasreur’s solution was prepared for rough
separation cultures, and a lump of Ginger-beer plant put in. On the 30th, the
