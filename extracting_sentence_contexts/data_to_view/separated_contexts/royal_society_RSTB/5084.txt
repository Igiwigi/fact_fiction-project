If so, they indicate land conditions toward the end of the
Carboniferous. : The paucity of fossils in the Carboniferous and Minchia Series in contrast to the rich
faunas of southern and south-eastern Yunnan and of the Shan States recalls the
explanation offered by M. Deprar (1912, p. 144) of the diminution northward of fossils
in Yunnan. He attributes this fact to the destruction of the fossils by the increasing
dynamo-metamorphism of the beds ; the excellent preservation of the fossil fragments
in these scattered limestone outcrops as far N. as Lo-ta is, however, fatal to that
hypothesis. The rarity of fossils in the Carboniferous, and especially in the Minchia
Series, may be due to their deposition in conditions similar to the Cement-stones of the
Lower Carboniferous of Scotland. Fossiliferous beds are scarce in that series, and the
commonest are earthy limestones containing crinoid stems.
