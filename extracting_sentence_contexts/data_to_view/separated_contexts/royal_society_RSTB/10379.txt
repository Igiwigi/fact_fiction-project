There was a moving window of two stimuli presented at a time. After AB, for example, BC, BE, or BG followed with equal prob-
ability; if BC was chosen, the next input would be CD. To detect
regularities, the model had to be sensitive to the fact that, over
time, pairs (e.g. AB) occurred more often than sets of two items
spanning pairs (e.g. BC).
