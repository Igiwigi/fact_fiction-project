the chromosomes in both animals and plants. In the member of the Liliacez described
by them, namely Galtonia, these investigators found a difference in width between the
small and large chromosomes, although each showed a small range of variation. In the
Aloine the range of variation is much greater, and it was found that there was so much

overlapping in the measurements of the widths of small and large chromosomes that all
the results have been treated together in this table, although the small chromosomes
are, on the whole, slightly narrower than the large ones. Possibly they are slightly
deformed, due to the fact that the univalents of the smaller bivalents are already separated
and lie along the length of the spindle at the stage when the larger bivalents lie with their
univalent segments in the equatorial plate.

From Table VIT the following results emerge :â€”

(1) The width of the univalent chromosome at heterotypic metaphase shows a range of
variation, but the most frequent width is 1-5y to 2-Oy, and all the average values for the
width lie between the limits 1-4y. and 2-1p.

(2) The depth measurements from drawings of heterotypic spindles seen in profile
give 1-5y as the most frequent value for this dimension.
