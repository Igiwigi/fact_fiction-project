observed this phenomenon, I have used the disulphide of carbon as a reagent for the
detection of the phosphorus-bases ; for trimethylphosphine exhibits a deportment per-
fectly similar to that of the ethyl-body. The minutest quantities of these bases may
thus be readily and safely recognized. The reaction is best observed by pouring the
liquid to be examined upon a watch-glass, and allowing the vapour of the disulphide of
carbon to flow from an inclined bottle upon the liquid. Immediately the watch-glass is
coated with a beautiful net-work of the red crystals. It requires scarcely to be men-
tioned that the crystals are not formed when the phosphorus-bases are combined with
acids, They appear, however, readily on adding to a mixture of their salts and
disulphide of carbon, a drop of potash, which liberates the bases.

On the other hand, triethylphosphine may be employed with the greatest advantage
as a test for disulphide of carbon. There is, in fact, no test for this substance, which
in delicacy could be compared with it. By its aid the presence of the disulphide in the
most volatile fractions of coal-tar-benzol is readily proved ; even the exceedingly small
quantity of disulphide of carbon diffused in the most carefully purified coal-gas may, as
I have shown already in another place*, be recognized without any difficulty. When
the gas is passed through a bulb-apparatus containing ether to which a few drops of
triethylphosphine are added, the liquid s00n assumes a reddish tint, which gradually
increases in intensity, until, when the ether is evaporated, the interior of the apparatus
appears coated with a delicate efflorescence of the red crystals. Scarcely more than
half a cubic foot of the present London coal-gas is required for this experiment.

In order to satisfy myself that disulphide of carbon may be employed with safety as a
test for the phosphorus-bases, it was necessary to examine the deportment of this com-
