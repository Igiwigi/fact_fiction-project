Both the resistance and the back E.M.F. of the are depend greatly on the make of
carbon, that is to say, on the composition of the electrodes, since it is very improbable
that any two makers’ carbons have identical chemical composition, The experiment
of soaking a pair of solid “Conradty Noris” carbons in potassium carbonate, drying,
and re-determining the resistance, shows that the effect of introducing this potassium
salt was to reduce the resistance from 3°81 ohms to 2°92 ohms, and to increase. the
back E.M.F. from 12 volts to 15 volts for the same are length and current. A
similar effect is produced by drilling out one of the carbons and inserting a glass rod
as a core, probably due to the introduction of sodium into the vapour column. The
lower resistance and higher back E.M.F. of ares between cored carbous than of those
between solid carbons is also probably due to a similar cause, namely, the presence of
potassium silicate in the core. In fact, it seems probable that the whole of the
observed differences between solid and cored ares, and between ares for which
different makes of carbons are used, not only in resistance and back E.M.F., but also
in all their physical properties, are due to the different amounts of the traces of

foreign substances present in the are.

The author believes that if it were possible to obtain perfectly pure carbon
electrodes, then the resistance of the are between them would be very high, so high
that it might be impossible to maintain a true are between them at all. He is of the
