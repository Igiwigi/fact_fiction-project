and their radii given by the following equations:—

tan?” = tan PH. tan QH,
tan?” = tan OH. tan an, 7 (150)
tan? "= tan OH . tan PH,

The first equation is evident, since P, Q are conjugate points with respect to J; and

the second ſollows from the fact that the bisectors of the angles ABD and DBN pass
respectively through O and H.
244. The points O, P, Q are the centres of J, J', J”. Let their distances from H be
denoted by 3, ?', 3" respectively, and the preceding equations may be written

Hence we get the three following equations:
