about the point A, and will carry the tide in snccession to all
the points of the coast CD. These lines will have the general
form of cotidal lines which we have described ; and will be
determined in their details by the shore along which the pro-
gressive tide-wave travels. (See fig. 3.)

11. But there is yet another modification which the cotidal spaces of the oceanic
tides undergo, in passing into the cotidal lines of littoral tides. The oceanic tides
produced by a stationary undulation, with its midline of no tide, give tides neces-
sarily differing siz lunar hours from each other on the opposite sides of the ocean.
It is high water on one side when it is low water on the other. Now this cannot be
the case all over an ocean which is of different breadths in different parts; nor, in
fact, can it be the case in any part of it. For that motion of the parts of the fluid
which a stationary undulation requires, cannot take place on a shore shallow in pro-
portion to the, depth of the oceanic spaces. Near the shore, we shall have a tide
which is progressive from the oceanic space towards the land. Hence, even when
the tide occurs at the same time along a great extent of shore on one side of an ocean,
we cannot assume that it is directly produced by the oceanic tide. It may be a tide
which is later than the oceanic tide, and which may be represented by a cotidal line
bordering the space which the oceanic tide occupies. (See fig. 4.)
