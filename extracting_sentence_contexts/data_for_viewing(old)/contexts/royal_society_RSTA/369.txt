YP p(ri)./7 cannot be written as a similar product. This is problematic because

he arbitrariness of utility can be abused to justify reckless behaviour, and it
ignores the fundamental physical limits, given by time irreversibility, to what
can be considered reasonable. But because Bernoulli’s early work postulated the
ogarithm, many consequences of equation (6.10) have already been discussed in
he literature under the heading of ‘logarithmic utility’.

A different heading for these results is the ‘Kelly criterion’ [25-27]. In contrast

o ensemble-average exponential growth rates, which often diverge (for instance
with leverage), time-average exponential growth rates can be optimized [24,28].
Kelly [25] used this fact to optimize wager sizes in a hypothetical horse race
using private information. While he refrained from using utilities because he
deemed them ‘too general to shed any light on the specific problems’ he considered
[25, p. 918], he did not point out the fundamental difference in perspective his
treatment implies: in essence, arbitrary utility functions are replaced by the
physical truth that time cannot be reversed. My aim here is to emphasize this
difference in perspective. It is crucial that logarithmic utility from this point of
view is not a utility at all. Rather, the logarithm accounts for the multiplicative
nature of the process: the ensemble average of the logarithm of growth factors
equals the logarithm of the time average of growth factors.

Comparing equation (6.10) and equation (4.1), it is tempting to say
that the time average justifies logarithmic utility. I advise against this
