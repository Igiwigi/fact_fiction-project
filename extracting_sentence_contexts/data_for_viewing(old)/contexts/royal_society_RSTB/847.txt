As is seen in fig. 4 the focus of greatest representation is at Gg, Gh.

(b.) Elevation of the Angle of the Sume Side.—The representation of this movement,
which from @ priori considerations we did not anticipate finding, was observed in single
instances at squares :— E

(c.) Elevation of both the Angles of the Mouth.—As a corollary to the facts just
related, the actual observation of bilateral representation of this movement of eleva-
tion of the angle of the mouth was seen on two single occasions, viz., at squares—

This bilaterality is therefore very rare.

(b.) Lips.

In describing the movements of the lips we have observed occasionally such uni-
laterality of representation as to lead us to regard the lips, e.g., the upper and the
lower, as divisible into two halves, viz., the right and the left. We have, therefore,
