The experimental results, considered by themselves, bring to light the depen-
dence of a class of phenomena on the relation between the density of the gas and the
dimensions of objects, owing to the presence of which the phenomena occur. As long
as the density of the gas is inversely proportional to the coarseness of the plate, the
transpiration results correspond ; and in the same way, although not 80 fully investi-
gated, corresponding phenomena of impulsion are obtained as long as the density of the
gas is inversely proportional to the linear 8ize of the objects exposed to its action. In
fact, the same correspondence appears with all the phenomena investigated. We may examine this result in various ways, but, in whichever way we look at it,
it can have but one meaning. If in a gas we had to do with a continuous plenum
such that any portion must possess the same properties, we should only find the same
properties, however small might be the quantity of gas operated upon.
