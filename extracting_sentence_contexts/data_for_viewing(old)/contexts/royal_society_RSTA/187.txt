o acquire a continuous range of overlaps (as characterizes the SK spin-glass
phase). These transitions are, however, pre-empted by a dynamical transition a
a higher temperature, Tp, again to 1RSB. The fact that Tp > Te means tha
he system becomes glassy before the thermodynamic limit for paramagnetism
is reached.

The analogue in random K-SAT is that, although, in principle, there is a
imit a. separating SAT from UNSAT, in practice, computer programs basec
on local dynamical algorithms are unable to reach this limit but stick at a lower
Q@p, the analogue of Tp. The recognition of the existence and quantification o
he resultant intermediate HARD-SAT region came through the application anc
extension to K-SAT of statistical-physics techniques developed for spin glassses
(Mézard et al. 2002; Mézard & Montanari 2009). In fact, the technique, known as
‘survey propagation’ (and a development of the original cavity method; Mézarc
et al. 1987), can often be applied to specific as well as averaged problems and has
proven extremely useful practically.!!

Furthermore, there are other quasi-transitions in the p-spin glass; for example,
at a temperature higher than Tp, a p-spin glass acquires an extensive
configurational entropy that affects response and correlation functions without
being thermodynamically relevant, again with an analogue in K-SAT (Krzakala
et al. 2007). Studies of the p-spin glass in an applied magnetic field demonstrate
that, beyond a critical field, the dynamical and thermodynamical transitions
come together. One might therefore usefully consider the possibility of including
an analogue of such a field in a computer algorithm to assist in the solution
