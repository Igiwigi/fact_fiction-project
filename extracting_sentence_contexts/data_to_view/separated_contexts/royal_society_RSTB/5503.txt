entire embryo (p. 448), which projects on the surface of the connecting stalk (as
the result probably of the artificial deformation of that structure) (figs. 28 and 29,
Plate 32). FrortAn has called attention to the fact that, in the cranial region of the allanto-
enteric diverticulum in an embryo with four paired somites (embryo Bi II), vacuoles
appear in the basal parts of the endoderm-cells of the ventral wall (FLoRIAN, 1930, a,
Plate I, fig. 7). In the caudal part of the diverticulum the vacuoles are present also
in the cells of the dorsal wall. SrerNBERG (1927), in his description of the allantoic
endoderm also in an embryo with four paired somites, did not mention vacuoles, but
spoke of faintly stained cytoplasm.
