occurs primarily as an appeal to a higher level of generality. Those rare examples that did arise
were typically in comments containing (or referring to) proofs. In particular, we found examples
of case-split proofs (in which a case was proved because it was shown to be a special case of
the general (proved) case) and inductive proofs (for instance, ‘why does a property hold in the


case n =5?’ (explanandum) ‘Because of the inductive argument that it holds for all natural n’ 0 |
(explanans)).

For both Kitcher and Steiner, a difference in level of generality between explanandum and 13
explanans would be a prerequisite for their theory. Since Kitcher is so narrowly focused on proof 1S
products, we would not expect to find examples of his type of explanation in our dataset, and : gS
we did not. However, the fact that it was so rare to find examples does have implications for : 3

Steiner’s theory of characterizing properties. While the idea that explanations turn on what is
distinctive about an object may be intuitively appealing, it was not representative of what we
found. There is a sizeable body of work on whether proofs by case split or by induction are
explanatory (for example, [62-64]); however, since they formed such a small proportion of our : a
examples, we conclude that the lack of evidence that we found for Steiner’s theory suggests that 1S
it does not apply to this context of mathematical practice. : =

True. Of the 176 explanations in our explanation-indicator approach, we found that 69% occurred PD
