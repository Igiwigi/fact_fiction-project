I have now become the less concerned to prepare such products
because, while the process by which they are cbtained—hydrolysis at high temperature
—is not one likely to throw much light upon the constitution of the pigment from a
synthetical point of view, repeated efforts have convinced me that the yield must
always be so small, that for analytical work it is nearly, if not quite, as convenient to
work with the natural substance. V. Analysis of the Natural Yellow Pigment. Having regard to the fact that the substance is an amorphous one, its purity being
therefore difficult to demonstrate, the following analyses are given with all due reserve. But it will be seen that substantial agreement is obtained in the figures yielded by
pigment from entirely different species, and even from different genera, a fact which
should certainly add to their value. A sufficient number of a given species of insect
to yield pigment for quantitative work is seldom to be obtained on any one occasion.
