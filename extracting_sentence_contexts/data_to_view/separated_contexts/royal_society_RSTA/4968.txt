No one could deny Maxwell’s virtuosity in determining the speed of light from his mechanical
model of electromagnetic forces.


5. Act 4. Maxwell on ‘A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field’ (1865) 9 |

Maxwell was well aware of the fact that the theory as propounded in his paper ‘On Physical .
lines of force’ was ‘awkward’ and considered it only a ‘provisional and temporary hypothesis’. ia
The mechanical basis of his insights could be misunderstood, or even ridiculed, but they 1
had set Maxwell off on the right track towards the definitive theory of the electromagnetic [3
field. He therefore set about recasting the theory on a much more abstract basis without any io
special assumptions about the nature of the medium through which electromagnetic phenomena :S
are propagated. In 1865, he published his great paper entitled ‘A dynamical theory of the a
electromagnetic field’ [1].
