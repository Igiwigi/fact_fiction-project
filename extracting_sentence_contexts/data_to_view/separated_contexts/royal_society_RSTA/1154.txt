slow plastic distortion of this type is used in order to measure the viscosity of glass at
temperatures at which it is beginning to soften. As has been mentioned in connection
with plastic flow in metals, most of these tests have been carried out under conditions
like that of extension under a direct load, where the type of distortion is determined by
the condition of symmetry alone. Experiments on the plasticity of glass have in fact been limited to determining the
rate of distortion for different loads under varying conditions of temperature, etc. It
seems that there would be no inconsistency in any existing experiments if the distortion
of glass under load were not that of a very viscous fluid but were similar to that of metals
for which v is not equal to Â». Tt seemed worth while therefore to carry out tests with
glass tubes similar to those already described with metal tubes.
