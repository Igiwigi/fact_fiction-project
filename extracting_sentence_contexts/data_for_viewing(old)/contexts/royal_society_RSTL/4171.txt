What appeared to me most remarkable was, to find lead, a body s0 little elastic,
yield a sound as powerful as those proceeding from the other metals, when placed
under the same circumstances. The position of metallic hars with respect to the
poles of the electro-magnet did not in any way modify the result of the experiment ;
they might be placed axially, that is to say, in the direction of the poles, or equatori-
ally, that is, across the poles; the effect remained the same, being merely weakened as
the distance between the bar and the poles increased. In order to hear the sound
distinctly, when not very powerful, it was sufficient to establisgh a communication be
tween the metallic bar and the ear by means of a wooden rod. In this manner the
sound was not unfrequently heard prolonged some seconds, though growing con-
stantly feebler, until it ceased entirely, after the source of magnerism had been with-
drawn from the electro-magnet. Mr. Farapay has remarked an analogous fact in
the action of the transparent medium on the polarized ray, an action which does not
cease immediately with the magnetism of the electro-magnet. Is this prolongation
owing to the magnetization of the electro-magnet not ceasing in a sudden manner ;
or to its return to its primitive molecular state not taking place instantaneously in the

substance submitted to its action ? This question I am unable to decide. I incline,
however, rather to the latter of these explanations, sceing that the effect is not equally
perceptible in all bodies, and that it is, for example, more sensible in a bar of bixgmuth
than in one of copper.
