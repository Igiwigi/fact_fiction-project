the burette through the water and mixed with hydrogen, the behaviour was as if it
had not been exposed to light at all. The process of bubbling through the water thus
washes out the substance in the chlorine which causes the difference between the
insolated and non-insolated chlorine.

The anomalies observed in the final rates of formation of hydrochloric acid in these
experiments are to be attributed to the differences in the mixtures in the two burettes.
at is impossible to obtain with this method two exactly similar mixtures, and the

ffects of small changes in the composition of the mixture are large. If an excess of
Bhlorine be present in the mixture, the results with different tubes are fairly
yeomparable, much more consistent results being obtainable than with an excess of
shydrogen. This fact agrees with BuNsEN and Roscor’s result, that a small excess of
Shydrogen makes a very much greater difference in the rate of combination than that
Bbroduced by the same excess of chlorine,
e The effect of insolating the chlorine alone passes off if the chlorine and hydrogen
“Anixture be left in the dark for some time. The behaviour is then similar to that of
‘She ordinary insolated mixture.
2 There is, therefore, a change produced by the action of light on moist chlorine alone,
“which i is apparent when the chlorine is caused to combine with hydrogen. Draper
Zonsidered that an allotropic modification of chlorine was produced, which combined
Snore readily with hydrogen than ordinary chlorine. It seems more probable that the
Spffect is due to some action between the chlorine and the water vapour, which is
=always present in these experiments. For water vapour, if not absolutely necessary
&to the action, assists it very materially.
