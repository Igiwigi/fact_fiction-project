Such paper is easily procured of very even texture, but if examined in the light
it is found penetrated with actual holes, which though of minute dimensions, suffer
light to pass freely and are very injurious. To obviate this, and to equalize the light
by dispersion, an additional thickness of such paper may be advantageous]y inter-
posed between the glass and the photograph to be re-transferred. And, finding this
in fact to be quite necessary to the production of a tolerably good effect, it occurred
to me to impress this paper also with a facsimile of the original, or in other words
to double the photograph intended to be re-transferred. This may be done by taking
off two such photographs from the original design, which being fixed, dried and
pressed flat, are to be applied to each other (face to back), and being first delicately
adjusted under a magnifier, by fiducial points made with a fine needle in each, are in

the middle of each side. The operation is easier than it would appear to be by the
description, and the resulting effect offers an infinitely nearer approach to that of an
ordinary copper-plate engraving or mezzotinto, than anything that can be got from
a single model.
