strains are identical with those we have encountered in the glasshouse and behave
towards each other in a similar-manner.

Hansen’s work shows that both in the field and the glasshouse the X virus content of
most naturally infected potato plants is rarely confined to a single strain, and subse-
quent work at Cambridge goes to confirm this. Natural infections, however, with
either of the two extremes of the series X” and X” respectively, often appear to be pure.

In potato plants suffering from interveinal necrosis in the field only the X% strain
has been found, though when a stock is carried on by tuber in the glasshouse it is not
rare to find that in subsequent years in one or other plant of a clone a more or less
complete clinical recovery has taken place. In such a case only X¢ may be found. It
would, however, be quite unjustifiable to assert that the X” was in fact unmixed at the
start without more careful analysis. The virulence of X* is so far in excess of that of
X*, X¢ and still more of X”, that even were such to be present, they would need to be
in very considerable concentration before their presence would be detected. If for
some reason X* died out, then another strain, even if present in the smallest quantity,
would have a chance of overrunning the plant. At the other end of the series we have
found X” apparently unassociated with any other strain in all the otherwise healthy
Up-to-date plants examined.

From experimental work we know that healthy potato plants infected with either
X#, X¢ or X* cannot in subsequent seasons be further infected by sap inoculation with
X° or X", These facts should inspire caution before invoking mutation within the tissues
of the potato as a general explanation of the mixed infections found in nature. It
