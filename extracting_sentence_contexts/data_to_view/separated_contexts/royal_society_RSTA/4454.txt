§ 54. Part 3 of Mr. Wuymrer’s pamphlet, dealing with the “Determination of
Altitudes,” discusses the best method of utilising the readings of aneroid barometers. I hardly think that Mr. Waymrrr makes due allowance for the fact that in
mountain ascents the reduction of pressure is very gradual, even at the lower stages. This allows accommodation to take place, so that on arrival at the summit the
instrument will not behave as it would have done if rapidly transported there. Again the difference between descending and ascending readings is very different in
aneroids whose readings as pressure falls at a given rate may be equally correct, and
the difference increases ceteris paribus with the length of time spent on the mountain
summit.
