The ulterior theory of the double functions is intended to be carried out on the

like plan. As regards these, it is to be observed here that we have not only the

16 equations leading to linear relations between the squared functions, but that the

remaining 240 equations lead also to linear relations between binary products of

different functions. We have thus between the 16 functions a system of quadric

relations, which in fact determine the ratios of the 16 functions in terms of two

variable parameters #, y. (The 16 functions are thus the coordinates of a point on

a quadri-quadric two-fold locus in 15-dimensional space.) The forms depend upon six
© constants, «, b, c, d, e, f: and writing for shortness

a= Va=za-y,

= 1
FH Vab=,—{ vVa=rh—zf—zc=y.d—y.e=y+wvVa=yb=yf—y.c—zd=ze=r},

 (observe that in the symbols ab it is always f that accompanies the two expressed
© letters «, b—or, what is the same thing, the duad ab is really an abbreviation for the
5 double triad abf.cde) ; then the 16 functions are proportional to properly determined
-2 constant multiples of

& Va vb, Ve, Vd, Ve, VF, ab, Vac, ad, ae, be, Þd, be, cd, Vee, Ae,

4 and this suggests that the functions shall be represented by the single and double letter
= notation A(u, »), . . AB(u, ») . . . viz., if for shortness the arguments are omitted, then
E we have

EATB, OC, D, E, F, AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE

Z Proportional to determinate constant multiples of the before-mentioned functions
= TV vab,...ofzand y.

24. It is interesting to notice why in the expressions for 1/ab, &e., the sign con-
necting the two radicals is + ; the effect of the interchange of a; y is in fact to change
(1, v) into (=u, —») ; consequently to change the sign of the odd functions, and to
leave unaltered those of the even functions : the interchange does in fact leave 1a,
&c., unaltered, while it changes ad, &ec., into —ab, &c. ; and thus, since only the
ratios are attended to, there is a change of sign as there should be.
