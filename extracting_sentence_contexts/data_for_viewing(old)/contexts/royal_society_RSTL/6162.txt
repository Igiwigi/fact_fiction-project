40. Although my experiments, already detailed, on the thermal effects of stretching
india-rubber were not, on account of the imperfect elasticity of that substance at low tem-
peratures, well calculated to give exact numerical results, the Lonary conclusion derived
from them is perfectly in accordance with Professor Tnoms0N's formula, where, in this

instance &, the expansion, being negative, the result indicated is a rise of temperature on

the application of the tensile force. 4
41. When, by keeping india-rubber at rest at a low temperature for 80me time, it has

become rigid, it ceases to be heated when stretched by a weight, and, on the contrary, a
cooling effect takes place as in the metals and gutta percha. The experiment by which
I ascertained this fact was made with a piece of india-rubber + of an inch square, which
had been exposed for several days to a temperature not lower than 5* Cent. In this
state it was found that the application of a tensile force of 14 Ibs. produced a deflection
of 20/, indicating cold, and that a contrary deflection, indicating heat, was produced by
removing the weight. After raising the temperature of the rubber to 159, the elasticity
of the rubber was restored, and the reverse phenomenon of heat on stretching produced,
indicated by a deflection of 15',

substance before I was acquainted with Mr. GoucGn's discovery of the properties of simple
india-rubber, above noticed. The superior permanency of the elasticity of rubber in
combination with sulphur, and its unimpaired existence at low temperatures, rendered
it better qualified for experiments in which accurate numerical results were desired.
