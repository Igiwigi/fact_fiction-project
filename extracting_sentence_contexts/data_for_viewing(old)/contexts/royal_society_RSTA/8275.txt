grain of alumine.” :

As there was no schedule or general description of any kind in the box nor has any
record of these materials been found at the Royal Institution or elsewhere, the specimens
had to be grouped and classified without any initial knowledge of their nature. Some
of the specimens were imperfect, containing seams or other mechanical flaws, though on
the whole they were sound enough for examination purposes, that is, considering their
size and the difficulty of their manufacture in such small quantities. It should be realised
that the ingots were quite small, varying from 14 to 4} oz. in weight. Quite a number of
the alloys mentioned by Farapay were not to be found among the seventy-nine existing
specimens ; for example, it was unfortunate that some of the alloys containing high
percentages of platinum or rhodium could not be traced. Proof that Farapay
actually made these is to be found in the fact that he gives measured values of their
specific gravity, agreeing sufficiently well with the values calculated from their com-
position ; but not a single specimen of these special types has yet been found, though
a most careful search has been made in the Royal Institution and in Sheffield.+

Turning now to the examination of the specimens, the first of those available was
taken in hand on November 27th, 1930, and after some delays arising from the
