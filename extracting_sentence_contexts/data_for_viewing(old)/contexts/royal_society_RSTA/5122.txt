The chemistry experiment performed at the GSI [32] with 78°FI and ?5°Fl circumvented
two major problems. By using TASCA [80] as a pre-separator [79,81], Fl was isolated in-flight
from unwanted nuclear decay background. Coupling two COMPACT detectors in a row and
operating the first one isothermal at room temperature allowed a much better resolution at
higher temperatures. This is relevant while probing adsorption temperatures differences in less
volatile elements. The direct coupling of COMPACT to the TASCA-RTC also allowed for a very
short transport time of (0.81 + 0.06)s. The adsorption behaviour of Fl, its w-decay daughter Cn,
their lighter homologues Pb and Hg and the noble gas Rn were studied simultaneously in a
gas-chromatography experiment [32]. Two Fl atoms were detected; one decay was assigned to
288F] and one to 7*°F]. Both appeared at room temperature in detector #9 of the first COMPACT.
These Fl events were separated from the main part of Pb and Hg observed at lower detector
numbers. The volatility of Fl is demonstrated by the fact that it was transported in the flowing
transport gas to the detector. The reactivity of Fl is evaluated from its adsorption on an Au surface
at room temperature, where Cn does not adsorb as readily as Pb and Hg. This indicates that
Fl is less reactive than Pb. A minimum value of the (negative) adsorption enthalpy of greater
than 48kJ mol~! was determined [32]. This reveals the metal-metal bond character for the Fl
adsorption on Au surface. The FI-Au metal-metal bond is at least as strong as the Cn—Au one.
The rather volatile Fl is the least reactive element in group 14—but still a metal—and not as inert
as a noble gas. This behaviour is in agreement with recent fully relativistic calculations on the
adsorption of Fl on an Au surface [76,82] but disagrees with an interpretation of adsorption of Fl
on Au surface merely due to physisorption [31].
