And sImilarly, we may show that

yZ—$Y=0
2$X—2Z=0;
whence X:L:Z::8X

And this is, virtually, the Parallelogram of Forces. Thus it appears that the notation #.» is capable of affording a simple proof of the.
great fundamental theorem of Statics ; this application of the method is given, however,
as I stated above, merely to show by example what can be done in this way. I may
observe that the whole of the proof here given depends simply upon 7wo things, the
distributiveness of 4.v, and the fact that numerical coefficients may be brought out
