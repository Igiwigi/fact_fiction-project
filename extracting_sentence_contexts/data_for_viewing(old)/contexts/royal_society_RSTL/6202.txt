and it is apparent that the contravariant in terms of five letters is derived from that
expressed in terms of four letters, by substituting &—e, Þ—z, 74 —#, 3—2 respectively for

between &, 3, y, 8, 4.

these are the very transformations by which the contravariant in four letters is expressed

It is equally easy to show that in a covariant we may substitute for @, y, 2, 4, v,
