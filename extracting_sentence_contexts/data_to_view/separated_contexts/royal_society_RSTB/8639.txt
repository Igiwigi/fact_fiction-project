There are two critical points to make, however. First, if idea that the structure of language reflects the structure of

iconicity plays a pivotal role in establishing displacement experience. For example, the principle of ‘iconicity of sequence’
in evolution, this fact already makes iconicity more than (or ‘sequential order’) holds that the sequence of forms
just a marginal phenomenon. Second, and more crucially, conforms to the sequence of experience, as in the famous collo-
we would not expect effects of iconicity in language proces- cation veni, vidi, vici. The principle of ‘iconicity of contiguity’ (or
sing and acquisition if the role of iconicity were limited to ‘linguistic proximity’) assumes that forms that belong together
jump-starting referentiality in evolution; however, we do conceptually and semantically will occur closer together
find such effects of iconicity.
