AG = (Ay + Ay)HG pm = (1 +11 + 1G = (N + HG, 3

so the mode order N corresponds to the quantum harmonic oscillator’s principal quantum ae
number, and the quantum energy eigenvalue N +1 is related to the total Gouy phase on fo
propagation [8]. :4

In fact, we can consider the operator analogue of the classical quantity M, Dy

M=Ay - Ay=}@2+% - 7, -%)- By is

The commutator [M, A] =0 (as we could have anticipated from the Poisson brackets of the
classical observables), and so there is a mode set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of Mand H—
this is the HG modes. In fact, MHGmnn = (im — n)HGnn: the spectrum of yM consists of integers
—N,-—-N + 2,...,N; this ladder spectrum resembles that of an angular momentum operator (with
an extra factor of 2), originating from isomorphism of the underlying su(2) Poisson algebras. Here
Mis the difference of two Hamiltonians, distinguishing a set of Cartesian axes (up to a rotation
by 180°), but no sense of linear or angular momentum associated with it.

The LG modes are of course eigenfunctions of angular momentum, with L= AxPy — dyPx = id9,
and despite having different eigenfunctions, the spectrum of L being the allowed values ¢,
ie. -N,-N +2,...,N —2,N, is identical to that of M. The steps of 2 are required with each unit
increment in p, as N=|¢| + 2p. Therefore, with our definition, even mode orders only consist
of modes with even angular momentum, and likewise for odd. Mathematically, this can be
understood from the analytic form of the LG modes: (1.2) must be an analytic function of its
arguments R and ¢ (equivalently, x and y) everywhere in the transverse plane, including at the
