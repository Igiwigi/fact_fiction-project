of 5ea waters, in different parts of the ocean, &c. 16g

Edinburgh, * Dr. Joun Davy, now of Ceylon, and M.
Gay-Lussac,] have also added many useful facts to this
part of natural science. These two last observyers, in particular,
have given the specific gravities of waters in a variety of lati-
tudes, from England -to Ceylon, and from South America to
France, and their results appear to lead to the general conclu-
sion, that the variations obtained in those parts of the ocean
were but very slight, and are to be ascribed rather to acci-
dental causes than to any general principle.
