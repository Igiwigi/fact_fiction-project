representing a greater proportion of independent evolutionary time on the
tree represent more total evolution and so should be prioritized. Therefore,

using metrics to assess and prioritize PD attempts to account
for the fact that species differ substantially in the amount
of complementary genetic information that they embody
[3-5]. Such techniques are a practical way of accounting for
the unequal contribution of species of conservation concern
to biodiversity conservation. Building on this recognition,
species-level measures that integrate evolutionary history
and likelihood of loss of a given species have been developed
over the past two decades [2,5—7]. The field of research has
moved rapidly, with the consequent translation of theory
[1,4,8-10] into conservation practice [6,11,12].

Despite this welcome development of global-scale metrics
for species prioritization, the majority of conservation action
