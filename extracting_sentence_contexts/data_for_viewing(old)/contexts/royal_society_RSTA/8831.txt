whenever the usual method of approximation is seriously out, even though in none of
the cases above does the convergency of the series actually fail.

In the above the series are in powers of tan 8,. Had they been taken in powers of
tan «, as is frequently done, the first and second order approximations would have
been far worse.

One interesting outcome of these calculations relates to the relative importance of
the terms in E7é,‘ and At’. The ratio E¢,?/A is small in every case taken (of course
these exclude the neighbourhood of points where A = 0, where naturally E becomes
of great importance), But for the set of magnifications taken, the greatest ratio of
the second term to the first is less than 0°03 and the mean value of this ratio is only
0°0082, so that, in fact, the E term—although so complicated algebraically—does not
exercise any great influence numerically.

This is important, as it shows that, at any rate for lenses, it does not require to be
computed with anything like the same order of accuracy which is needed for A and B.

$14. The Singular Inclination and Convergency Factor for any System.

Referring again to fig. 2 we see that ’ = a, and F,I, = —Az, for rays proceeding
through the system reversed and initially parallel.
Thus using accents, as before, to denote the coefficients and inclinations for
