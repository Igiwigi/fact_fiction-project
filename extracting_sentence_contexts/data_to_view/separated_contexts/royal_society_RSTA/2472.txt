So, we have a ‘unique proof’ modulo
the second syzygy module. We would like to note that we do not need a finite resolution. In fact, we only need, in this
context, a resolution of length n > 1.

3. Conclusion and future work

In this article, we established an analogy between the reduction of polynomials and proofs. Since
the reductions can be seen as paths in a graph, we also have an analogy between paths in the
graph and proofs.
