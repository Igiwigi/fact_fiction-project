According to (51), a, b and c being constant,

3(F,) p = 20080 + 2b(4dd-+ yoy), (52)

and the increments (40, 6, dy) /a? resulting from dy, = 1 have (in our approximation) values
as shown in figure 7a, 6 andc. Therefore the ‘relaxation pattern’ giving the effects of this unit
increment to yy is as shown in figure 8.

This ‘plastic pattern’, since it involves local values of 0, 4, y, differs for different points;
moreover it applies, strictly, only to infinitesimal y-increments. On both accounts the

relaxation process may be laborious, but in fact (as in earlier papers) the labour was not
found prohibitive. A use of inexact ‘patterns’ saves time and does no harm provided that exact
account is kept of the ‘residuals’ (Southwell 1946, §170).

28. Starting from the elastic solution (§23) a normal procedure will bring to zero all
F's, as given by (51), which initially are positive; where they are negative the strains are
still elastic, so (51) must be replaced by (50), figure 8 by figure 6.
