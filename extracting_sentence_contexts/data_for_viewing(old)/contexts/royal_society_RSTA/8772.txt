to select two gases whose series relations are known, and the present section of this
communication details the experimental results obtained by our method of measurement,
with a view to the discussion given in later sections.

In our experiments with mixed gases, we have not been able to eliminate as a source
of error the possibilities of effects arising from small differences in pressure in the
different tubes, but as the effects observed do not correspond to those which would
accompany an alteration in pressure, we feel that the observed phenomena may be
deseribed as particular to the mixed gases.

We have made experiments on this subject in two cases, which present strikingly
dissimilar phenomena. In the first case, the gas consisted mainly of Helium, with
only a very small admixture of Hydrogen—sufliciently small, in fact, to justify the
statement that practically only a trace of Hydrogen was present. In the second case,
a considerable addition of Hydrogen to the Helium was made, so that the tube
actually contained a ‘mixed gas,” in the sense that the orders of magnitude of the
quantities present were the same. For purposes of comparison, we also examined the
spectrum, under like conditions, of the purest Helium which could be obtained, and
which we have already mentioned. We shall refer to this as “ pure Helium,” and to
a similar spectrum obtained with the purest available Hydrogen as that of “ pure
Hydrogen.”

Allied to this investigation is another on the spectrum of Helium under very low
pressure, and it is convenient to record and reduce the observations relating to this
question with those relating to mixed gases, the mode of reduction being identical.
