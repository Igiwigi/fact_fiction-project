The case of the tides of the German ocean, for instance, where the order of the tide-
hours had led me to draw the cotidal lines as converging to a centre of no-tide (as
in Article 15), has been differently explained by Mr. Airy. He conceives that
these tides arise from the combination of a tide running along the eastern coast of
England to the south, with a tide coming through the Straits of Dover to the east. But the combination of these two tides would, in fact, produce such cotidal lines as
I have drawn, with a point of no-tide where I had predicted it, and where it was
found by Capt. Hewsrr. It is true, that on this supposition the point of no-tide
would not be a point of rest of the ocean ; nor did I ever suppose that it would be 80. There is, at the point of no-rise-and-fall of the surface, a considerable stream of tide
alternately north-east and south-west, as Capt. Hewerr found.
