subjacent 18 inches. This is equivalent to nearly 3 tons of phosphate of lime per
acre in the top soil, with 6 tons lying below, well within reach of the plant in its later _
stages of growth. In face of this enormous quantity of total phosphoric acid the
wheat crop, which, under the most favourable circumstances, does not need more (and
usually needs less) than some 30 Ibs. of phosphoric acid per acre, is unable on these
plots to do more than eke out a half-starved existence, even when nitrogen is freely
supplied. The history of the crops clearly indicates that, of the total phosphates
present in the soils of these plots, only a small proportion are in a form in which they

can be utilised. Even in ordinary farming it is a familiar fact that, on soils con-
taining a good deal more phosphoric acid than this, a few ewts. of superphosphate
per acre will often make the difference between a full crop of roots and one that is all
but a failure. This being so it is evident that such ratios as those just given for
total phosphoric acid would have little significance if we wished to compare soils from
different fields, or to judge of their relative mineral fertility, or to forecast the probable
advantage of applying phosphatic manure or the economy of withholding it.

Tf, on the other hand, we take the phosphoric acid dissolved by a 1 per cent. solu-
tion of citric acid we find differences of an altogether different character ; for, while
