“perforations.” As Prof. JEFFREY has
shown, the vascular supply to the leaves
and sporangiophores (which he regards as
sporophylls) is usually nipped off tan-
gentially or almost tangentially from the
stelar bundle,* and in such cases leaf-gaps
are naturally out of the question. More-
over, in the stele of the transition region
distinct gaps are already present, although
here leaf-traces are either absent or too
feebly developed to produce gaps (text-
fig. 2 b-d; see also Berrranp, 1881,
figs. 215-16, pp. 248-49). In fact, gaps may
appear in the xylem even in the region of
the rhizome, as seen in fig. 14, Plate 6,
and in a transverse section of an unusually
large rhizome figured by Hotnoway.} As
this author suggests, the diameter of the
rhizome probably has to do with the hol-
lowed out or dissected nature of the xylem
cylinder. The section photographed in
fig. 14, Plate 6, is of a size greater than
the average for Z'm. Véieillardi. In rare
cases, however, owing to the crowding of @® i
gaps and traces it may so happen that a
