At Uttray Mullay and Dodabetta, within the
influence of both monsoons, we find the annual curve of temperature interrupted
in the first place in March, then in July, October and November in 1845, and in July,
August and September in 1846. At Dodabetta the increase is quite gradual from De-

stations may modify these conclusions. Range of Temperature and Hours of Maxima and Minima. Unless where hourly observations are taken, the exact periods of the occurrence of
the maxima and minima cannot be determined ; and though a self-registering thermo-
meter will determine the range of temperature, yet the hours of the turning-points
cannot be learnt from it.
