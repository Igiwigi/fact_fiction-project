homographic point-systems ; and, as a particular case, (A, B, C, C') and (A', B', C', C)
will be homographic point-systems. It is proper to notice that if F is a sibiconjugate
point of the involution, then (A, B, F, F) and (A', B', F, F) are not (what at first sight
they appear to be) homographic point-systems.

162. Imagine an involution of points; take on the line which is the locus in quo of
the point-system a point O, and consider the point-system formed by the harmonics of
O in respect to the several pairs of the involution ; and in like manner take on the line
any other point O', and consider the point-system formed by the harmonics of O' in
respect to the several pairs of the involution ; these two point-systems are homogra-
phically related to each other.—See Fifth Memoir, No. 111.

163. Two involutions may be homographically related to each other ; in fact, take on
the line which is the locus i quo of the first involution a point O, and consider the point-
system formed by the harmonics of O in relation to the several pairs of the involution ;
take in like manner on the line which is the locus in quo of the second involution a point
Q, and consider the point-system formed by the harmonics of Q with respect to the
several pairs of the involution; then if the two point-systems are homographically
related, the two involations are said to be themselves homographically related : the last
preceding article shows that the nature of the relation does not in anywise depend on
the choice of the points O and Q. And it is not necessary that, as regards the two
involutions respectively, the words line and point should have the same significations.—

164. Four or more tetrads of points in a line may be homographically related to the
