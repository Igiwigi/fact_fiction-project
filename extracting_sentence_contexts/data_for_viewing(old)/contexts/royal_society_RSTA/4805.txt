that more realistic 3 + 1 dimensional models that allow for spreading wavepackets and imperfect
interaction with reaction would produce beables giving the same qualitative description of reality.

Of course, demonstrations in more sophisticated models would be useful: we aim to produce such
demonstrations in future works.

Our models also necessarily rely on a hybrid ‘semi-relativistic’ treatment of photons travelling

at light speed interacting with particles or objects for which relativistic effects are negligible.
This treatment can certainly be significantly improved, although it will be hard to provide a
fundamentally correct and rigorous treatment, given the difficulties in modelling any realistic
quasi-classical physics within quantum field theory as presently understood. Nonetheless,
the consistency of quantum field theory with Minkowski causality, reflected in the fact that
propagators fall off rapidly outside the future light cone and in the existence of the Tomonaga—
Schwinger formalism, suggests to us that the strategy of defining beables at a point by
conditioning on final outcomes outside its future light-cone is natural in quantum field theory.
It suggests too that the qualitative features of the beables descriptions of reality in our toy models
should accurately reflect the pictures that should emerge from a fully relativistic field-theoretic
treatment.

Mass density beable ontologies were first proposed for non-relativistic collapse models by
Pearle & Squires ([4]; see also [5]). An extension of these ontologies to relativistic collapse models
using constructions previously defined in [6,7] was proposed in [8]. These proposals apply to
generalizations of quantum theory rather than to quantum theory itself.
