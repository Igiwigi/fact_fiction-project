The difference here is not the 3 centims. to 6 centims, due
Sto sex. The improvement in the result when we apply the female formule for all four
Along bones to the estimate of the stature of the gorilla is noticeable also, if to a

lesser degree, in the cases of the chimpanze and orang. We may sum up our

results as follows :—

(a.) Man is apparently differentiated from the chimpanze and orang by direct
selection of stature, but this direct selection appears to be small in the case of the
gorilla.

* If the chimpanze and orang be treated as “‘ dwarf men,” and their statures estimated in the manner
indicated on p. 224 below, the femur and tibia give statures, F, 115-5, 105-0; T, 118°0, 112°5 respectively,
nearer the actual values, in fact too small, but the radius and humerus still give values far too great. The stature of the gorilla as estimated from femur and tibia in this manner now becomes far too small.

(b.) Man and the gorilla appear to have followed common lines of differentiation
from a common stock in the case of the femur and tibia, but the differentiation on
which they have not followed common lines has not been that of radius and humerus
alone, or (k) would have given good results.

(c.) Other organs closely correlated with stature beside the four long bones must
have been differentially modified in the case of the chimpanze and orang, or (k)
would still have given good results.

(d.) The accordance between the result given by female (%) and the observed
stature of the gorilla, and the want of accordance in all other formule, seems to
show that woman has been principally differentiated by these four long bones from
the common stock, while man has been differentiated in other organs highly
correlated with stature. For example, the differentiation in pelvis may be much
greater.
