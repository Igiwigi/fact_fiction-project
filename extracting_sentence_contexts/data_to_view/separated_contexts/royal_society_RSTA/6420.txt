In other words,
when one is asked the second question, concerning the momentum, in any given sequences,
the information carried over from the preceding question, concerning the position, does not and,
in principle cannot, influence the response to this new question, or the future predictions from
this point on. According to Wang and Busemeyer: ‘When one is asked a subsequent question,
information carried over from the preceding question provides a context for the construction
of the second and influences the subsequent response’ [33] (p. 2). That may often be true in
psychology and human decision making, but is never the case in quantum physics, beginning,
again, with the fact that quantum objects do not possess information. No information carried
from an earlier position measurement (answering the question about the position of the object)
has any relevance for any subsequent momentum measurement (asking the question about the
momentum of the object). This fact renders this earlier information meaningless as concerns
future predictions.
