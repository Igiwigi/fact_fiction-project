sufficient general histological evidence for the existence of such a medium, and there
is no doubt that for hair itself this medium, which we have identified with the phase
K,, is the least resistant to chemical attack, as is shown by a number of experiments
in which the fibre is readily disintegrated into its constituent cells by a process of
chemical or bacterial “ retting.”

Fig. 8 shows a diagrammatic scheme for the distribution and interaction of the
three elastic phases of the hair fibre. It is based on idealized rhombic dodecahedra
elongated along a tetrad axis, but the precise form is immaterial to the argument that
the phase K, effectively forms a continuous sheet between each layer of cells, and that
all three phases act both in series and in parallel. Furthermore, it must be emphasized
that the whole treatment in this paper is based on the hypothesis, which appears to
be consistent with the known facts, that there is no sharp demarcation between the phases,
and. that, fundamentally, they must all be considered as “ keratin,” though keratin slightly
variable mainly through certain side-chain modifications. From this point of view we
must regard the intercellular keratin, K,, as being deficient in certain of the chemical
cross-linkages which bridge the main chains (such as the cystine bridge—see below),
the cell-wall keratin, K,, as being most crystalline or most “ organized ” (as one might
expect from other X-ray investigations of cell-wall structuret), and the intracellular
keratin, Ky, as being physico-chemically the most resistant of all three.

An ideal load/extension curve for three such transformable phases, in series only
and each perfectly homogeneous, would have something of the form of the thick line
OABCDEF in fig. 9, in which the small Hooxe’s law extensions are neglected, and
the steps are roughly of the scale observed experimentally in hair. The actual load/
