Specializing to the smooth wall case for simplicity, we then obtain the global balance of streamwise
momentum of the unresolved eddies by integrating over the space-time domain

Here, we have defined Q), = {(x,y,z) € 2 : y>H —hor y <h — H} whichis the set of points within
distance h of 82 and we have noted that the inertial drag force fj, ¢ is non-zero only in the layer
Qh4e\2h of thickness €. The dominant balance in (4.3) is between the two terms in the first line, when h, £ < H. In fact,
the final term from the applied pressure gradient is of order O(y( + ¢)) and the other term in
the second line from the time-derivative is O(UH/T(¢/H)°) with o = 1/3 when £ is chosen in the
inertial range at wall distance h and even smaller at those 1, £ where the velocity field is smooth. The main term in (4.3) from the inertial drag force has two contributions that follow from

The magnitude of these two contributions depends upon the scaling properties of two flow
quantities (u)p,¢,7, (uv)n,,7 defined by the following averaging operation:

the slab (S24¢\Sy) which supports the inertial drag force has been thickened by ¢, because the
quantities that appear in (4.4) are smeared over that length-scale.
