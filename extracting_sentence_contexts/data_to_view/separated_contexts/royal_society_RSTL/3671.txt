Haſted, which' con-

tend that the ſweet cheſnat is 'an indigenous tree
: of this country, and which are intended to be com-
municated to the'Royal Society,

As I do not ſee any reaſon for altering the opinions
which I have happened to form on this ſubje&, from
what is contained in theſe three letters, I ſhould not
trouble the” Society with any anſwer 'to' the contents
of them, did not Mr. Thorpe contradi&, on the
teſtimony of another perſon, what 'T have afferted
I was an ocular witneſs of. I muſt therefore a ſecond time repeat, that the
cheſnut woods near Newington, in Kent, are planted
in rows at four or five yards diſtance (other trees often
intervening); and for a proof of -this fact, I refer
Mr. Thorpe to the woods on the North Eaſt of the

church ;


{ 168 }
church®; as alſo the wood to the eaſtward of the
great road to Canterbury, immediately after you
leave the town of Newington,

I ſpent very near a whole day in the examination
of theſe woods; but I would more. particularly re-
fer to the two cheſnut plantations above ſpecified,
as they were juſt then ſhooting from the ſtools,
when I took this very minute view of them. I have already faid, that I am willing to leave the
point in controverſy, upon what hath been advanced.
on the one fide, and on the other.
