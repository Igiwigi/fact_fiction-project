that there has been so little detailed investigation of them or consideration of the
flora. The plant-remains are often abundant on the surfaces exposed. by splitting
the sandstones, shales, and mudstones, but they usually give the impression of crowded
debris. The remains might often be regarded, not unjustly, as so broken up and
decayed as hardly to repay collection and examination. Although most of the
rock, especially in the Red Downtonian, is quite barren, the plant-remains occur
at various horizons throughout the formation. Thus in the Grey Downtonian
they are found in the Ludlow Bone-bed, the Downton Sandstone, and in the Teme-
side Shales ; these collectively form WickHam Kinoâ€™s sub-division I.1. In the Red
Downtonian they are well represented at the horizons I.2, 1.8, and 1.9. Some details
of the localities studied at these horizons will be given later (p. 280).

One main difficulty in the collection and study of this flora has lain in the fact
that attention cannot be limited to a small number of isolated and definite speci-

mens. Such specimens occasionally occur and are valuable. But much has been
learnt from the examination of the poorly preserved debris on the rock. This
unsatisfactory material has been studied in various ways: by inspection on the
rock surface by reflected light ; by making film-pulls and film-transfers ; by micro-
toming pieces dissolved out from the matrix by hydrofluoric acid ; and by grinding
