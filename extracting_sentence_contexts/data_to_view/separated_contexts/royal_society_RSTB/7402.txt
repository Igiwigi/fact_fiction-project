Cross-winds might be relatively ineffective. The shape and amplitude of the record were
determined not only by features of the oscillation but depended also on the position of the
thermograph in relation to the mean level of the thermocline; a simple two-layered system
would of course produce a square-topped wave. In spite of the fact that the record was
confined to one depth, it shows that the water was never at rest. Displacements forced
