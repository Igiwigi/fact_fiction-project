3. The critical point

Figure 2 shows that depending on (v,€), or equivalently (i, €), the branch of the dispersion curve
extending upwards from ({29,0) may tilt backwards up to a critical point marked with a cross,
where d.2/dK =0, beyond which it slopes forward. This point will be denoted (2c, Kc), where 2
is the critical frequency and K, is the critical wavenumber. To determine their values, we use the
fact that Ke is a root of d(2?)/d(K?) =0, regarded as an equation in K*, and from (2.15) we have
