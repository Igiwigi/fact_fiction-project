In spite of much searching, however, I have not been able to trace a series of
intermediate stages in the formation of such an alveolus. Two other points in the histology of the resting pancreas of the toad are deserving
of mention and further investigation. The first, which has some relation to the
appearance just described, is the fact that the alveoli immediately surrounding such a
“resting” islet are more fully loaded with secretory granules than those in the rest
of the gland. This was noticed by JArorsky in the mammal, and by him attributed
to the formation of a prezymogen by the islets. I have also noticed it in the resting
dog’s pancreas, but the difference in the toad is far more striking.
