Chemistry, their intimate acquaintance with these branches of
science,. renders them, peculiarly fitted for, such_ an under-
taking.

It is one of the most important subjects to which Mr. Davy's
discoveries can be applied, and he has given it the considera-
tion it deserves.

The VorTaic battery is met with in the torpedo and-elec-
trical eel, and although iis given oaly as a means of catching
their prey, and defending themselves, and therefore not im-
mediately applicable to the present inquiry, yet it furnishes
two important facts, one, that a VoLTA1c battery can be formed
in a living animal, the other, that nerves are essentially ne-
cessary for its management; for in these fish, the nerves
connected with the electrical organs, exceed those that go
to all the other parts of the fish, in the proportion of twenty
to one. The nerves are made up. of an infinite number of
small fibres, a structure so different from that of the electric
organ, that they are evidently not fitted to form a VoLTArc
battery of high power ; but their structure appears to Mr.
Davy to adapt them to receive and preserve a small electrical
power.

"That the nerves arranged with muscles, s0 as to form a
