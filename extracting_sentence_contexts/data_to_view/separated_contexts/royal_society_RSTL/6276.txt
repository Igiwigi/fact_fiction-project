The neck and back, along

ginal ſtate: the head, face, and: breaſt, with belly,
legs, arms, and thighs, are almoſt wholly white,
the pudenda and axillz party-coloured ; the ſkin of
theſe parts, as far as white, being covered with white
hair ; where dark, with black. Her face and breaſt,

excited in her, have been immediately obſerved to
glow with bluſhes; as alſo when, in purſuance of
her buſineſs, ſhe has been expoſed to the aRion of
the fire upon theſe parts, ſome freckles have made
their appearance. After having deſcribed her pre-
ſent appearance, as well as I am able, T ſhall not
pretend to offer any conjeQtures of my own upon the
ſubject; leſt being led away by a train of reaſoning,
I ſhould loſe myſelf, in endeayouring to eſtabliſh a
favourite hypotheſis ; but, on the contrary, ſhall
confine myſelf to a ſimple narration of ſuch facts, as
may prevent miſtakes, or obviate difficulties, ariſing
in the inveſtigation of this difficult piece of phyſical
hiſtory. And in the firſt place, leſt the change
ſhould be thought the conſequence of a previous
morbid ſtate, ſhe declares, that, excepting about ſe-
venteen years ago, when ſhe was delivered- of a
child, ſhe hath never been afflicted by any complaint
of 24 hours continuance ; and that ſhe never remem-
bers the catamenia to have been either irregular or
obſtructed, only during this pregnancy : the hath
never been ſubje& to any cutaneous diſorders, or
made uſe of any external applications, by which this
phznomenon might be produced. The effe&s of
the bile upon the ſkin are well known to phyſicians,
and-have given riſe to an opinion, that its colour was
determined thereby : for my own part TI cannot be-
lieve it has anything to do here, ſince, from all the
circumſtances I have been able to colle&, I cannot
find the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpe&, that this fluid, whether
cyſtic or hepatic, has undergone any alteration.
