Snow crystals will fuse together (sinter) and then densify through
annealing or coarsening driven by the tendency to reduce surface energy [54]. These processes are
driven by either surface or volume diffusion or the transport of mobile surface films [1]. Indeed,
they underlie the fact snow drifts soon form a crust on their surfaces or that one can form a solid
metal object beginning with a metal powder [55]. Therefore, the agglomeration and densification
of matter is facilitated by time and very low collisional speeds where weak attractive interactions
dominate. When we gently toss a snowball against the wall it will bounce, falling to the floor and
shattering.
