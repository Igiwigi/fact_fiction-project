The grounds whereon the identity of the fluid contained (in the Echinoderms) in
the system of the blood-proper with that which fills the water-vascular system and
the abdominal cavity is maintained, may be briefly stated as follows :â€”In Uraster
papposa the oral membranous disc exceeds very much in diameter that of the common
Asterias. This circumstance renders the circular central blood-vessel in the former
much more conspicuous and accessible than in the latter. It was this fact which led
me to make choice of Uraster as the subject of my researches. In this species the
circular channel forming the centre of the blood-system coincides with the circum-
ference of the oral membranous disc. The vascular channel (scarcely to be called
a vessel) rests upon the hard edge of the calcareous framework.
