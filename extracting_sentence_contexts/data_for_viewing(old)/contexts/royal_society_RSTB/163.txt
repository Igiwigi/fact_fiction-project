intense current of short duration. The experiments of pu Bors-ReyMmonp previously

referred to show that such is the case. To this subject we now proceed.

ILI. The EHlectromotive Changes following the Passage of Electrical Currents
through the Organ.

The term “secondary” clectromotive is applied by pu Bors-Rrymonp (33) to the
changes produced in excitable tissues by the passage through these of electrical currents.
The work of pu Bors-Reymonp, followed by that of Hermann (34), Herine (35),
and BiepERMANN (36), has shown that, in addition to the ordinary phenomena of
electrolytic polarisation, there are special electromotive changes which are intimately
connected with the vitality of the tissues experimented upon. The main fact may be
broadly stated thus: the passage of a galvanic current of considerable intensity, and
of short duration, through a tract of muscle or nerve, is followed not only by the
electromotive changes accompanying ordinary polarisation, but by a prolonged electro-
motive change which presents the characteristics of being the electrical index of a
prolonged excitation. This is not, strictly speaking, the view which pu Bots-
{kYMOND took as to the nature of his discovery. According to the upholders of the
molecular hypothesis, the passage of a galvanic current is followed by two sorts of
polarisation—the ordinary negative polarisation, and a special positive polarisation,
this last being an alteration in the condition of the vital electromotive molecules. It
is simpler to call the latter effect an excitatory effect, and it will be thus desiguated
here. The earlier work of pu Bors-Reymonp has been succeeded by the publication
of the results of similar experiments carried out upon the electrical organ of the
