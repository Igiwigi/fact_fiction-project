The solid
elements (figs. 64 and 65), relatively to the bulk of the fluid, are scanty. Similarly to
what, was observed in the Bryozoa, the cells exhibit several varieties. It is a fact of
considerable interest, that the floating cells of all inferiorly vitalized fluids should be
characterized by variety more or less numerous, in the form, size and structure of the
corpuscular elements. The adult type of the corpuscle in the blood of the tunicated
Mollusk is marked by no other feature of constancy than that of the orbicular figure. Sometimes this form is modified into the flat circular; frequently the cells are simply
nucleated, again they are destitute of this part.
