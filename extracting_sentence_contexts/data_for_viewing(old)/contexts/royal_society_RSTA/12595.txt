of the table. In the last line of Table VIL., as in the corresponding lines of Tables IV.
and V., the column 7 contains the representative days of smallest spot area.

$16. The progression of the figures in Table VIL is less smooth than in Table V.,
but the conclusions indicated are very similar. In each of the first five lines, where
the selected days were those of largest spot area, there is a conspicuous trough a few
days before the representative day n, followed by a considerable rise to a crest, which
oceurs usually on day n+4. This crest markedly overtops the average mean, except
for the group of years 1891, 1895, and 1896, which exhibits the same peculiarity as in
Table V. In addition to this pulse there is a second pulse, as in Table V., with its
crest about 11 days before the day of largest sunspot area. The chief departure from
the phenomena seen in Table V. is that this earlier pulse has become decidedly more
prominent. This fact, and the further fact that the earlier, or secondary, pulse is in
both tables especially conspicuous in the case of the highly disturbed years 1891, 1895,
and 1896, suggests that the phenomenon is largely a pure disturbance effect. At the
same time, the years of sunspot minimum 1890, 1899, and 1900, show a more
prominent crest at day n—12 than do the years of sunspot maximum, which were

much more disturbed.

An explanation of the secondary pulse which may suggest itself is that a reduction
of sunspot area below the mean for the year is itself a cause of disturbance. If,
however, this were the true explanation, the last line in Tables V. and VIL. should
exhibit a crest about day n+4 much more prominent than the crests in any of
the other lines at day n—11. This it will be seen is far from the case.
