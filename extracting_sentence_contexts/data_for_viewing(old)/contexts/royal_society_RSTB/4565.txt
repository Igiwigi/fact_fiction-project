occasionally be allowed to draw a pelagic net for half an hour, and send in the
resulting captures for investigation. Our request was on the whole very courteously
complied with, and during the years 1911-1915 hauls were made at about
550 “Stations” by twenty-three different vessels, steamers and sailing ships, of
Danish nationality, one of them belonging to the Danish Royal Navy. A chart of
the stations* shows that they are well distributed throughout the North Atlantic
area. I may state at once, that the yield of larvee of the European eel amounted in
all to 120. This represents about one larva for every fourth or fifth station, a result
which must be considered satisfactory in view of the highly primitive equipment, the
short hauls, and the fact that a great number of the stations were in areas where eel
larvee do not occur.
During the first two years (1911-12) the collections of material made were chiefly
from vessels sailing between the English Channel and the West Indies, but the
yield was generally poor, three larvee from one station being the highest. An
encouraging feature, however, was the finding of a larva only 34 mm. in length at
25° N., 51° W., both from the fact that the previous minimum record (41 mm.) was
thereby beaten, and also because the locality of the find suggested a place of origin
even more to the south and west than we had hitherto been warranted in imagining.
The material, however, was still too small and too sparsely distributed to give us the
distinct indication we desired ; indeed it is hardly too much to say that with each
new observation a new problem arose, demanding a solution of itself, without
otherwise contributing to the elucidation of the matter as a whole. Consequently,
