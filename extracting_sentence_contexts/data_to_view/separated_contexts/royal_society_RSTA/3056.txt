Or the border war that flared up after
that? Or the ensuing cross-border migration? In fact, attributing economic or other social losses
to climate change turns out to be very difficult [13]. In contrast to the previous scenario where
insurers always lose, here the claimants would always lose, defeating the very purpose of a loss-
and-damage policy. Unless this attribution problem is solved, the use of attribution in a traditional
insurance model seems unlikely where ‘big ticket’ impacts are concerned.
