of electric spectra are lost. Obviously the quantity of light must diminish with the slit,
and the evil is made greater by the necessity of keeping the latter at some distance from
the discharge. If it be nearer than 1:5 inch, or at most L inch, the inductive action of
the spark charges the theodolite, and the observer, on applying his eye to the telescope,

gets a stream of pungent sparks anything but pleasant. But in order that the whole
2

object-glass may be illuminated, we must have this distance less than a n—;

and F being the aperture and focus. This limit in the present instance =0-03 inch, from
which it is obyious that a comparatively small portion of the light can reach the object-
glass. I was led to this discussion by a fact which at first startled me a little. When
obtaining the deviations of FRAUxnoreR's lines, T was surprised to find that H was not
visible to me, nor any line beyond þ; though in 1838, with the same prism, but with a
Slit in the shutter 15 feet distant, T saw several beyond K, TI concluded that my eyes
had become insensible to rays of short waye-length (in analogy to WoLLasToN's inaudible
sounds), or that their humours had undergone some change by which they absorbed
that part of the spectrum ; but neyer suspected the collimator. However, last year, while
examining a very fine Munich grating belonging to Mr. Sroxes, I was 8urprised to find
that it showed me the missing lines perfectly : here the aperture was a slit gg at 18 feet.
He was 80 kind as to entrust me with the grating; and on my return home I found
that with the collimator it behayed no better than the prisms had done, but that with
