ALGEBRAIC FUNCTIONS WITH AUTOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS. 19

The differential equations (1) and (2) determine t in terms of z in the two cases
respectively.

The constants /,, k,,... k,-1, are as yet undetermined. The reason is, that we
have not yet made any use of the condition which in fact does determine them;
namely, that all the projective substitutions, which ¢ undergoes when the independent
variable z of the differential equation describes a circuit round one of the singularities,
are such as to leave unchanged a certain circle. This circle is, in the figure we have
drawn, the real axis of the variable ¢, which is unchanged by all the substitutions of
the group; but it may more generally be any circle in the ¢-plane. This condition

will be shown in §7 to be equivalent to the determination of (n — 1) complex
Syuantities, which are the constants k,, k,,...k,; But a Sa consideration of

Bhis i is deferred to §7. For the present we shall suppose /,, /,...k,-, determined in
such a way as to give the required representation.
