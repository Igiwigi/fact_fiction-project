(3°76) is compatible with the condition of theorems 5, 7 and 9 if

EQUATIONS OF SIMPLE BIRTH AND DEATH PROCESSES 363
For example, we can take a=5, b6=2, c=1;
a simple process with these parameters is given by
A, = w(nb+-2n4), fy = fe.
We summarize these results in

Turorem 10, If the parameters of an analytical process in which Ay ~ 0, satisfy the conditions
