The multiple origin of the coelomic spaces of the anterior somites of P. moseleyi, P. capensis,
etc., is no evidence that such a somite represents the mesodermal components of more than
one segment. The initial cavities are variable in numbers and in position, and the somite
once established with its large single cavity is clearly homologous with the somites in similar

positions in the species where the initial cavity is single. This fact is of theoretical importance
(see discussion p. 556). The cutting off of each somite from the mesodermal band usually occurs relatively earlier
in the more posterior somites in all species, so that separate solid blocks appear first and
their cavities develop immediately after (figures 26, 45 and 46, plates 32 and 34). However,
exceptions occur, and one embryo of P. moseleyi at the stage shown in figure 45 has been
found with only traces of coelomic spaces in the posterior seven or eight pairs of somites,
while the anterior seven pairs show large cavities.
