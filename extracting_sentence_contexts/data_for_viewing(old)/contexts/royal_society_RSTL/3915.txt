F.R.S., to the Royal College of Surgeons, leave no reasonable ground for further
hesitation or scepticism on the subject, since they display in a truly marvellous manner,
those soft and seemingly most perishable parts of the animal which are essential to
convey a true idea of its living form.

It must, however, be premised in vindication of the fruitful principle of physiolo-
gical correlations, established by Cuvisr as the key to the interpretation of fossil
remains, that, for some years prior to this discovery, there had heen obtained suffi-
cient evidence of the organization of the Belemnite, to determine both its ordinal
and family affinities ; but, as the value of this evidence failed to be appreciated by
80me experienced palzontologists, from want of sufficient knowledge of, or faith in,
the laws of the interdependencies of the characteristic parts of 'the Cephalopodal
organization, the additional facts afforded by the well-preserved specimens from the
Oxford clay are most acceptable and yaluable.

In the compound shell of these specimens the following parts are recogni-
zable —

1st. The terminal spathose body called the © guard,” sheath or rostrum*, resembling
the head of a dart or javelin, whence the name Belemnite originally given to this part
