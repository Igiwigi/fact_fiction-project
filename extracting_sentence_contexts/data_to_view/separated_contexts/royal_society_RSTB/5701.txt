The only other zygopterid at present known to possess secondary wood is Ankyropteris
corrugata (Scort, 1912, pp. 376, 382), recently described in detail by Hoiprn, 1930,
Plate 7, figs. 4 and 5; Plate 8, fig. 18a.* Scorr (loc. cit., p. 884) drew attention to
several points of resemblance with Botrychioxylon, and some of these apply also to Z.
primaria: the “mixed pith” (somewhat doubtful in our species), the temporary
abaxial curve in the leaf-trace, and the presence of secondary xylem in both stem and
root (only occasionally in A. corrugata). An uncommon feature described by HoLDEN
(1980, p. 85) is the presence of traumatic secondary wood in the petiole of A. corrugata,}
recalling a character which is normal in Z. primaria. But in spite of all these facts
the closed peripheral loops of Ankyropteris remain a serious obstacle to any close affinity
with Zygopleris, as with Botrychioxylon. There is no other genus of Zygopterids, sufficiently well known, with which Z. primaria
can be even remotely compared. Summary.
