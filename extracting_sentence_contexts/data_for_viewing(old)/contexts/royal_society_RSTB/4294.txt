the pigment becomes purple, which is the colour characteristic of this pigment when precipitated in the
presence of alkali, and not the brownish-red colour of the pigment in alkaline solution.

strongly to the conclusion that these two alkalies differ profoundly in their modes of
affecting the cell.

There is, in fact, no evidence whatever that a strong base ever enters a living cell.
Loxp’s dictum that bases are efficient in the proportion in which they enter the cell
is, therefore, opposed to experiment.

As far as Tam aware Prof. Lozs has not advanced any other explanation beyond
that quoted above. ‘The theory advanced in this paper does, however, give a
consistent and practical explanation of all these facts. Free alkali increases the
permeability of the egg surface or membrane to other electrolytes, and its action is
antagonised by acid or by bivalent metals in exactly the same way as an artificial
membrane is affected by these substances (see Grrarp, Perrin, and MIngs).
