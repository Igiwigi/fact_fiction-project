—069)(v* . . —6z)(v*. . —&)=0,
containing the factor (v+1)*, and which, divested hereof, gives the required modular
equation of the order 12, which was in fact obtained in this manner. Observe that writing u=1 we have (9+1)*(0—1)=0, or say 6,=0,=08,=—1, 4,=1;

the modular equation then becomes

{(o—1)(v+1)}v+1)(o—1)+(v+1)'=0,
(v—1)*(p+1)*=0.
