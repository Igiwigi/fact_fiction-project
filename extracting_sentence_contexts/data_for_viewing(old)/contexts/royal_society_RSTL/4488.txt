W,=weight of vessel.

W,=weight of water occupying, or which would occupy, the space whose section
is STRD.

0 =the inclination from the vertical.

Since in the act of the inclination of the yessel the whole volume of the displaced
fluid remains constant, and also that volume of which STRD is the sectionF, it fol-
lows that the volume of that portion of which the circular area PSRQ is the section

* This result connects itself with the well-known fact of the rise of a vessel out of the water when propelled
rapidly, which is s0 great in the case of fast track-boats, as considerably to reduce the resistance upon them.
+ It will be obseryed that the space STRD is supposed always to be under water.
