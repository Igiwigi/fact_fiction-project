elsewhere. The pores of the petaloid portions and of the modified “ petal ” also appear
to be formed in the same way, although the tube-feet appear soon after the ambulacral
plates have been laid down and while the plates are still small. The ocular pores are
formed in a different way. The plate is at first dorsal to the oculus, and later grows
right round it.

D.—The Fasciolar Spines.

In the early stages all the spines are formed in exactly the same way as the typical
spines in Eehinus miliaris (GorDoN, 1926, pp. 268-272, figs. 5-7). Later they become
variously modified at their extremities, those on the sternal plates, for example, becoming
spatulate. The majority of the spines in Echinocardium are directed backwards owing
to the fact that the expanded base is much more developed on one side than on the
other (fig. 26, g). In the imago there is a slight indication of this asymmetry (figs. 7
and 16). The fasciolar spines, however, project at right angles to the test, and possess
a symmetrical, but poorly developed, base (fig. 26, f). ‘They remain short, and each of
the six prongs is elaborated at the tip, so that the distal end of the spine becomes
“tufted ” (fig 26, f). Examination of a number of fasciolar spines from the same test
reveals the fact that the “ tufted ” extremity is subject to considerable variation.
Many of these spines also bear rather long thorny processes along one side, while in
others the thorns are about equally developed on both sides. When the latter is the case,
the thorns are never so prominent as those shown in fig. 26, f.
