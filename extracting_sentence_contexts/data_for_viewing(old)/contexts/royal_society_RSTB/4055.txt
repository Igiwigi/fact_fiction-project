as pointed out by Doveras and Hatpane;{ and there is further evidence of a
similar process in venous blood.{ Finally, Bour and Henriques§ found that there
is a considerable disappearance of oxygen and formation of CO, in the blood passing
through the lungs, and particularly under conditions where there was oxygen-want
in the tissues on account of a restricted circulation. It seems probable that at high
altitudes the mean oxygen pressure in the blood passing through the lung capillaries
is insufficient to effect the normal amount of oxidation of these easily oxidisable
substances. The result of this will be that they are present in abnormal amounts in
the blood, and may either act directly as a stimulus to the blood-forming and other
organs, and to the lung epithelium, or else act indirectly by continuing to consume
oxygen after the arterial blood has left the lungs, and thus lowering seriously the
oxygen tension before this blood reaches the tissues. Against this indirect action
is the fact that the lips and faces of acclimatised persons on Pike’s Peak seemed to be
of a particularly bright healthy colour. In favour of it, on the other hand, was the
particularly cyanosed appearance of some of the newcomers. It was difficult to
imagine that the blood as it left their lungs could be so blue as to account for the
colour of their lips. There is the same difficulty in connection with the cyanosis often
observed in heart-disease, &e. The extraordinary effects of oxygen in clearing up this
cyanosis certainly seem to suggest that the oxygen acts by destroying easily oxidisable
substances in the lungs; for the oxygen cannot well increase to an appreciable extent
the saturation of the hemoglobin in the lungs, or give to the blood more than a very
limited amount of oxygen in simple solution.

The theory that the stimulus to the lung epithelium at high altitudes arises from
unoxidised metabolic products present in abnormal amounts in the blood agrees well
