from the thalamus to the cortex. It has been assumed so far
that dendrites are depolarized by excitatory volleys from
the thalamus, yet, it is unlikely that this excitation is
random and, instead, certainly convey meaningful messages.
Recent evidence suggests that the pairwise coordination of
thalamic neurons is preserved in NREM and REM sleep rela-
tive to the awake state [164,165] suggesting that the cortex
receives similar signals independently of brain states.

Much work on spindles still needs to be carried out. This
research will not only address some fundamental questions
about the role of sleep but will also open new avenues for clinical
research. In fact, spindles may play a protective role in the cortex
in some forms of epilepsy [166]. Furthermore, spindles are
diminished in schizophrenia patients [167]) and their global
coordination is impaired in mouse models of schizophrenia
[129]. More generally, the covariance of spindles characteristics
with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders
offers a promising use of spindles as a biomarker in neuro-
pathology. Determining a common function to spindles (and
potential differences), across species, brain modalities and
developmental stages [68,168] is certainly one of the great
challenges in sleep research in the next decade.
