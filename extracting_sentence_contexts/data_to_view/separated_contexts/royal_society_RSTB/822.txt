Increase of the watery constituents of the blood increases the contraction volume
and output to the same extent (though only temporarily) as does transfusion of
blood, but acts still more unfavourably on the heart, seeing that the work done
by the ventricles is increased, while the nutritive value of the blood supplied to the
coronaries is diminished. The increased output of the heart both in plethora and in hydrsemia is due to rise
of pressure in the systemic veins, increasing the volume of blood which enters the

aight ventricle during diastole. We refer to the bearing of these facts upon the
â€˜dreatment of chlorosis and heart disease. (Pp. 274-278.)
