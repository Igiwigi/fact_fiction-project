As already mentioned, it is
separated from the alyeus by a deep groove or pocket. Another small groove marks
off the portion of the alveus which lies beneath the fimbria as a separate column,
more distinct in the sections behind 6 than in the section figured. The sections show in a very striking manner, owing presumably to the fact
they are taken from a young animal, the way in which the fibres of the alveus t
origin in the cortex of the hippocampal convolution, pass between its columns of cals

sweeping inwards beneath the floor of the ventricle, curve round the groove
between the alveus and fimbria into the fimbria, in which eventually they assume
a longitudinal direction. In sections of osmatic brains the formation of the fimbria
from the alveus is obscured by the origin of large numbers of fibres in the hippo-
campus proper, if it is allowable to restrict this term to the reflected cortex.*
