one can find the local IDC in the real space as

The practical implementation of boundary conditions which satisfy equation (5.7) at a particular
frequency is based on the identification of (5.5) with the IDC at the same frequency of an
anisotropic MTS. In fact, equation (5.5) represents ellipses with axes aligned with the eigenvectors
of w. By denoting these eigenvectors as é;=é;() (i=1,2), one can write the diagonal form
representation as w = @1€)01 + @7€207, where oj; are the eigenvalues of a. This allows one to
rewrite equation (5.6) in the form ~

(kp 81)? + (kp - €2)on = (ky? (8)

As shown in the previous sections, printing patches on a grounded slab realizes equivalent
anisotropic boundary conditions which support SWs with IDCs which can be approximated by
ellipses with axes oriented along the symmetry axes of the elements (equation (4.10)). Hence, the
synthesis of the required IBC can be performed by matching the local wavenumber along the
principal directions with the values given by (5.8). Comparing (5.8) with (4.10), one has
