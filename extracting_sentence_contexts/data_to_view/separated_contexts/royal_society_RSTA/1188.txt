It seemed
to the writer that since, as has been pointed out, a minimum velocity of the air
is necessary for the formation ridges, and since this minimum is fairly sharply
defined, it was far more likely that the inception of ridge formation corresponded to
that breakdown of vortex-free motion which always occurs in the case of viscous fluids
when the velocity exceeds a certain minimum, as is well illustrated by, e.g., the forma-
tion of vortices between two concentric cylinders, fully discussed by G. I. Taytor. *
The experiments described in the paper on “ Circulations ” have shown that, similarly,
vortex motion sets in round a particle in a vibrating viscous fluid when certain condi-
tions of amplitude and frequency are fulfilled. Careful observation of ridge formation in a dust tube reveals the fact that quite often,
when there is but little dust, as, for instance, in the neighbourhood of a node, an isolated
system of only two or three ridges forms. This alone suffices to make it exceedingly
unlikely that ridges are formed in consequence of the forces calculated by Konia,
namely a repulsion in the line of vibration, falling off as the inverse fourth power of
the distance. Kornic himself, as has been pointed out, was not unaware of difficulties
in the way of his explanation, while Ropinson, who found the explanation sufticient,
demanded as a necessary condition that there should be a whole system of ridges to
