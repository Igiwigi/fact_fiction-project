The evolutionary behaviour of this rescaled distribution function is shown in figure 2. It is
seen that the distribution function first increases and then decreases with increasing time. Such
a behaviour completely corresponds to the dynamics of particle influx at the channel cross-
section yo (or Jp). In addition, the distribution function of fixed particle size at different channel
cross-sections (figure 2b) represents a bell-shaped curve that is shifted to the right relative to
the particle entry point yo. This effect is caused by the presence of flow velocity directed to
the right. The influence of Péclet number P = wL/D on the particle-size distribution function is
illustrated in figure 3. As is easily seen, the number of smaller particles decreases and the number
of larger particles increases with increasing Péclet number (figure 3a). This is due to the fact that
larger particles are transported faster by the fluid flow, and smaller particles dissolve faster with
increasing Péclet number. What is more, an increase in the Péclet number symmetrically shifts the
distribution function to the right, towards larger values of the channel coordinate y (figure 3b).

Figure 4 demonstrates the influence of various source cross-sections yo (where particles come
into the channel) on the distribution function. First, the closer yo to y, the narrower and steeper the
distribution function, and its maximum lies higher (figure 4a). Secondly, the distribution function
of particles of a fixed size uniformly shifts toward larger values of the channel coordinate y with
increasing yo (figure 4b). Note that the shift of a maximum point to the right for yo is explained
by the presence of fluid flow in the same direction. Figure 5 illustrates the three-dimensional
behaviour of the distribution function. This function moves along the time variable t, changing
its shape and amplitude (figure 5a). Strongly nonlinear behaviour of the distribution function in
