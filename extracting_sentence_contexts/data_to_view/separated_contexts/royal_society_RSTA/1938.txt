But as opposed to plants, this
organic carbon is rapidly consumed, serving as the base for the marine food-web, supporting
fisheries in coastal waters and the flourishing of micro-organisms at depth [15]. Moreover, their
sedimentation transports approximately 6.3 Tmol of silica per year to the deep ocean [13]. In fact,
global ocean fluxes of organic matter are partly controlled by this coupling between the sinking of
decaying phytoplankton blooms and aggregates [16-18] and other biophysical processes (such as
particle coagulation [16] and diatom-bacteria interactions in the so-called phycosphere [19-22]). Because they prevalently lack motility (gliding has been observed only in some benthic
species [23-25]), the dynamics of diatoms is influenced by two factors, advection by fluid flows
and sinking due to density mismatch with seawater. But contrary to long-time beliefs, these micro-
organisms are not solely passive particles.
