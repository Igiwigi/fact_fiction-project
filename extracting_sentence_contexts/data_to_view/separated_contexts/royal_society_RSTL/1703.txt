This
has actually happened. Some sheets of copper, that have


244 Sir Humenry Davy's additional experiments

been exposed nearly four months to the action of sea water,
defended by from #; to 45 of their surface of zinc and iron,
have become coated with a white matter, which, on analysis,
has proved to be principally carbonated lime, and carbonate
and hydrate of magnesia, The same thing has occurred with
two harbour boats, one of which was defended by a band of
zinc, the other by a band of iron, equal to about 4 of the
surface of the copper. These sheets and boats remained perfectly clean for many
weeks, as long as the metallic surface of the copper was ex-
posed ; but lately, since it has become coated with carbonate
of lime and magnesia, weeds have adhered to these coatings,
and insects collected on them ; but on the sheets of copper, de-
fended by quantities of cast iron and zinc, bearing a proportion
below +; the electrical power of the copper being less nega-
tive, more neutralised, and nearly in equilibrio with that of
the menstruum, no such effect of deposition of alkaline matter
or adherence of weeds has taken place, and the surface,
though it has undergone a slight degree of solution, has re-
mained perfectly clean : a circumstance of great importance,
as it points out the /imits of protection ; and makes the appli-
cation of a very small quantity of the oxidable metal, more
advantageous in fact than that of a larger one. The wear of cast iron is not 80 rapid ; but that a mass of
two or three inches in thickness will last for some years, At
least the consumption in experiments which have been going
on for nearly four months, does not indicate a higher ratio. This must however depend on the relation of its mass to that
of the copper, and upon other circumstances not yet ascer-
tained (such as temperature, the relative saltness of the sea,



on the preservation of the copper sheathing of ships, &c. 245

and perhaps the rapidity of the motion of the ship ;) circum-
stances in relation to which I am about to make decisive
experiments.
