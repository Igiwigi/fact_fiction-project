excitable tissues of the bell, and a stimulus to the tonic action of the more highly
excitable tissues of the polypite. And, as additional facts confirmatory of the same
view, I have also cited the observations of Eoxknarp, HeDpeNmAiN, FosteR, and DEW
Sar on the rhythmic action of the heart-apex under the influence of the constant
current; the observations of Dr. FosTER on the rhythmic action of the same tissue
under the influence of the faradaic current ; his observations on the phenomena of
artificial rhythm as they occur in the Snail's heart; the observations of Dr. BurRDoN
SANDERSON and Mr. PacGs on the rhythmic properties of the excitable tissnes of
Dionaa ; and my own observations on the rhythmical motions of the Frog's tongue.
But in thus suggesting 8ome modification in the current theory of ganglionic action,
T have been careful to state that I Uo not attempt to overturn, but merely to supple-
ment it. I think T have shown that the theory in question is inadequate to account
for all the facts, and that in order to render it a complete theory, we must recognise,
nob only a periodicity of stimulation on the part of the ganglionic tissnes, but also an
inherent tendency to rhythmic action on the part of the responding tissnes.

Light has been shown to act as a stimulus on the lithoeysts of the covered-eyed
Medusz.

The polypite of Aurelia aurita has been shown to perform localising movements
somewhat similar to those which are performed by the polypite of Triaropsis indicans,
though the localising movements are of a much more sluggish and uncertain character
in the former than in the latter species.

The effects of alternating the direction of the constant current on the excitable
