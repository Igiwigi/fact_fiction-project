k being any number and f any function expansible by Taynor’s theorem which
vanishes with m/M. For on expanding by Maciaurtin’s theorem we have

acceleration = M**f" (0) >

This is independent of m and therefore satisfies the experimental facts. There is
an application of Vicarre’s principle to the present subject; for k might vary
according to the temperature of the large attracting body. It need only be constant
as long as all the physical conditions (other than mass) are constant.

1. It was pointed out by Poyntine and Puriires (see paper quoted) that as regards
small changes in temperature near, say, 15° C., there can be no great variation in weight
with temperature as shown from various common experiments of great precision:
(1) pendulum experiments give an appreciably constant value of gravity (g) regardless
of the small temperature differences occurring at different times; (2) the value found
for the expansibility of a liquid, say, mercury, is appreciably the same whether the
