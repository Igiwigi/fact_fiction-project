and small particle size classes in the eastern portion of our study area, we conclude that the large
aggregates exchange most of their material with smaller size classes as they settle through the


water column. We further suggest that average particle settling rates for this region estimated by
Ohnemus & Lam [68] are too large, and return to reconcile the difference at the end of the next
section.

(d) Fluxes constrained by normalization to 2°Th

Among the approaches described here, we expect the strategies that couple the mass budget of
230Th with the sedimentation and burial of particulate lithogenic phases (§§3e, f and h) to have the
smallest uncertainties. Confidence in these approaches rests on the fact that the one-dimensional
mass budget of 230Th is known to +30-40%, as demonstrated in global models [64], in regional
models [94] and by applying empirical calculations using dissolved °Th data from the
ETNA [65].

230Th-normalized fluxes of lithogenic material obtained from surface sediments are influenced
by two factors that cause overestimation of the historical dust flux. Bioturbation of surface
sediments filters the record of sediment accumulation over time scales of centuries (near the
continents) to millennia (in the open ocean), so the average fluxes derived from surface sediments
include dust supplied by rare large events whose signal in the water column dissipated long ago.
Sedimentation on the continental slope and rise may also incorporate episodic input of material
that was reworked from sites upslope or on the nearby continental shelf [95], as evidenced by
nepheloid layers observed along the African margin [65,68].
