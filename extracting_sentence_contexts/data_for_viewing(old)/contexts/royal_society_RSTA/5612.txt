Unless otherwise noted, all AIMD simulations were run using the CP (Car-Parrinello) [165]
module within Quantum ESPRESSO [166] using ultrasoft Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
pseudopotentials [167,168] provided from the Quantum ESPRESSO standard pseudopotential
library. Gamma-only k-point sampling was used. Simulations were run in the NVT ensemble,
and Nosé-Hoover chains[169] were employed to maintain temperature. Simulation details are
provided in previous publications or are summarized here.

Binary metal halides: Car-Parrinello AIMD simulations were run on the superionic « phases
of AgI, Cul and CuBr, as well as zinc blende CuCl and rocksalt LiCl. Simulations were run for


35-50 ps of production time using supercell sizes of 32 (CuCl), 64 (LiCl) or 108 (CuBr, Cul, Agl)
atoms (except CuBr, which was run for 16 ps). For CuX, a CP fictitious mass of 800a.u. and a
timestep of 0.15-0.2 fs were used. For AgX, a CP fictitious mass of 400 a.u. and a timestep of 0.3 fs
were used. For rocksalt LiCl, a single vacancy was introduced in the 64-atom supercell to facilitate
hopping, and a CP fictitious mass of 400 a.u. and a timestep of 0.2 fs were used. All simulations
were run at 700K except LiCl, which was run at 800 K. The supercell lattice parameters were
a=15.5A (Agl), 14.3 A (Cul), 13.5 A (CuBr), 8.5 A (CuCl) and 10.3 A (LiCl).

Closo-borates: Car-Parrinello AIMD simulations were run for 50-60 ps of production time
using /2 x /2x1 supercells of FCC phases of o-LiBy2Hi2, B-LigBy2Hi2, LigBygHio and
NazBioHio. A CP fictitious mass of 400 a.u. and a timestep of 0.15fs were used. The mass
of hydrogen was set to that of deuterium. The supercell lattice parameters were a= 14.21,
c=10.05A (B-LiyBy2H12); a= 13.62, c=9.63A (a-LizBy2Hy2); a= 13.23, c=9.36A (Li2ByoHy0);
a=14.51, c=10.26 A (NapBi2Hyz); and a = 13.96, c=9.87 A (NazB 9H). Lattice-contracted and
