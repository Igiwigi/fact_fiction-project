ing rapidly forwards, and consider the incisura of the frontal bone as being mor-
phologicaly its distal extremity, then the angle mentioned indicates approximately the
amount of curye which exists. When the foramino-basilar and orbito-basilar angles are
equal, the foramen magnum and the orbital length lie at an angle of 180, or, in other
words, are parallel. According as the orbito-basilar angle is greater or less than the
foramino-basilar, the cranial curve is less or greater than 180".

The foramino-basilar and orbito-basilar angle and the cranial curve require to be all
considered together ; and this is more particularly the case, since it is a remarkable fact
that, while the foramino-basilar and orbito-basilar angles have a wide range of variation,
the adult cranial curve varies within much more restricted limits; or in other words,
the difference between the foramino-basilar and orbito-basilar angles in any skull being
limited, these angles are to a considerable extent interdependent. Thus in the Kafir
$ull 68, the foramino-basilar angle measures 128", and in the female Kafir it is 150*;
the orbito-basilar angle of the skull of the Hottentot measures 129®, and that of the
Greek ﬆkull 46 measures 150%; but a cranial curye 21* more; or less than 180* is pro-
bably never to be met with in any undeformed skull. One female French skull, 25,
has a foramino-basilar angle of 1627, while another, 26, has an orbito-basilar angle of
128*; but these two angles could not coexist in any skull except with very great defor-
mity; were they to do 80 they would give a cranial curve of 214*; and the only 8kull
in which $0 great a curye is approached is 91, the skull with the base driven in, in which
