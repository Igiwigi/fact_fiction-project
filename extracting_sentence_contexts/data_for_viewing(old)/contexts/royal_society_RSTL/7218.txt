on it.

The measuring-apparatus* (D, fig. 1) was a micrometer-screw, a piece of brass being
fixed to the end of it, through which passed a moveable circular Piece of the same alloy
faced with agate. On turning the screw, this piece of brass, as s00n as it. touched the
zinc cap, pressed against the short arm of the lever (7), and thus indicated the point of
contact. To obtain accurate readings, the screw was turned until the bent end of the
long arm of the lever covered the line on the table beneath it; and to avoid parallax, the
point was observed through the tube E, which has a very fine opening at the top and a
magnifying glass at the bottom.

With this arrangement readings can be made with little practice (of course avoiding
the back-lash of the screw), with great accuracy, in fact, easily to 0-001 millimetre.

The length-yalue of a turn of the micrometer-screw was found by measuring wires of
known diameter, These were measured some years since in Heidelberg, in Kircunopy's
laboratory, with a calibrated micrometer-screw under a microscope. I thought, how-
ever, the screw might have altered by constant use, as it had served to measure all the
wires used for the electrical conducting-power experiments made in conjunction with
other gentlemen. On applying to Mr. B. Stewart, he kindly placed at my disposal,
at Kew, their normal measuring-screw, and on redetermining the length-value of
a turn of the screw, it was found equal to 0:185 millimetre, agreeing almost abso-
lately with the former value, namely 0:184 millimetre. The mean of these two values
was used, namely 0:1845 millimetre. 'The milled head was divided into 200 parts, 80
that each division represents about 0-001 millimetre. A small correction had to be
