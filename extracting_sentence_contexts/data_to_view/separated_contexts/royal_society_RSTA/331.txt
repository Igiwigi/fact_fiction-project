An example of a causal network between the variables x; that can be estimated with LiINGAM. The non-zero bjâ€™s are :&
shown as arrows from x; to.x;, with numerical values attached to them. The network is acyclic, which is seen in the fact that after
a suitable reordering of the variables (which has been done here), all the arrows go down.

4. Testing of independent components

After estimating ICA, it would be very useful to assess the reliability or statistical significance of
the components. In fact, in the literature, independent components estimated from various kinds
of scientific data are often reported without any kind of validation, which seems to be against the
basic principles of scientific publication.
