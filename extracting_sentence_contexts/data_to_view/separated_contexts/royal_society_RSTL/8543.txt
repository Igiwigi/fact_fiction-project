Considering the prepotential V of an arbitrary point (@. . . c, e) as a given function
of (@...c, e) the coordinates of this point, and taking (z. . . z, w) for the coordinates
of the point N, which is, in fact, an arbitrary point on the surface, then the value of V
at the point P indefinitely near to N will be =W, if W denote the same function of
(v...z, w) that Vis of (@...c, e). The result just obtained is therefore

— 1. , WY£91 Tra=
VW=Hep P(3s+9)* (#=0),
or, what is the same thing,
—D(8+9)
— (UYTg
