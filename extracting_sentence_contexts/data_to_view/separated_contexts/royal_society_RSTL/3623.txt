To the one there was added
a few drops of hydrochloric acid, to the other a few drops of oxalic acid. In the
one case, the ferric ferrocyanide, being insoluble in hydrochloric acid, was precipi-
tated, leaving no trace of iron in the solution; in the other case there was a blue
solution, but the whole of the iron was not in the condition of ferrie ferrocyanide,
for the addition of more prussiate of potash caused it to become bluer. That this
was due, not to the affinity of the oxalic acid for the ferric oxide, but to that of the
citric acid, will be evident from the fact ascertained by the previous experiments on
the ferrocyanide, that this result would not have been obtained had the nitrate been
employed. IV. It is well known that if hydrosulphuric acid gas be passed through a solution
of arsenious acid in water containing a mineral acid a perfect separation of the yellow
sulphuret takes place, but if there be no free acid the solution remains yellow.
