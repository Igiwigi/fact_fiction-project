rapidly, and soon rendered the liquid media turbid ; and then fermentation came to a
head, and soon ceasedâ€”the yeasts falling to the bottom, or, in cases where the
Mycoderma was favoured, forming a thick film on the top. On looking for the
sheathed Schizomycete in such cases, it was rarely to be found, unless certain ordinary-
looking free bacilli could be taken for it. This was, of course, the question; and
experience soon showed that it would not do to conclude off-hand that the free bacilli
among the yeasts were simply the Schizomycete in question, because, on separating
the latter and cultivating them apart, in all kinds of media, at high or low tempera-
tures, in tubes, flasks, or in cells under the microscope, it turned out that three forms
at least were obtainable, and in some cases more, and none of these obviously
resembled the sheathed and convoluted form commenced with.

The only fact really established, so far, was that the vermiform sheathed bacillus
was not easily capable of direct cultivation in the form met with in the Ginger-beer
plant : a fair inference was that it probably escaped from its sheaths in the cultures
and then carried on its life asa non-sheathed Schizomycete, and that some one or
other of the various forms found in the yeast deposits was the one in question,

The methods employed for separation were the same as those already described as
being used to obtain the pure yeast-cultures, only the task was, of course, more
difficult, and attempts were made to bring the gelatine media more into use.

I also employed the following method, based on the observation that when the
