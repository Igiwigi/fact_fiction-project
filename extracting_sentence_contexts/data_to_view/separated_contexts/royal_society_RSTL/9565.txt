A straight wire in eo
nexion with earth was placed at an angle to the axis of the tube, and made to
approach it. The green line assumed a serpentine form, cutting the positive lumi>
nosity at its point of inflexion (Plate 29, fig. 28). 'The solution doubtless is connecte
with the fact that the presence of the conductor renders negative discharge easier fro
the part of the tube nearest to it, and that the streams of molecules, in consequence of
their inertia, persist in maintaining a nearly diametral path although the direetic
from which comes the demand for the negative discharge which is inclined ab an ang
to this. *
We will now return to the excepted case in which the positive luminosity is made
to pass in a zigzag direction through the tube (Plate 29, fig. 27). As we have 8aid,
the places where it appears to impinge on the side of the tube are marked by patches
of phosphorescence.
