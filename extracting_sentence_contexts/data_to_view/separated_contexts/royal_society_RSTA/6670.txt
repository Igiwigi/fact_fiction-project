We shall return to this
question in ยง 42.

39. In the membrane analogue, according to ยง 10, unstable conditions exist upstream,
where the circumstances correspond with A in figure 2, but stable conditions downstream,
where the circumstances correspond with B. Neither region in fact gave trouble, except
that very fine grading had to be employed, as indicated in figure 25, to determine S with
precision. The assumed conditions upstream were those of ยง36, and a multiplying factor
24 /3 x 100 was employed. On the finest net (part of which is reproduced in a supplementary
diagram) ยฅ-values were computed to one more significant figure.
