Table 1 gives expressions for w_,, together with the error term or difference cor-
rection, according to the number (r) of differences replaced by pivotal values. TABLE 1
r w_y error term
1 —h(dw/8x), + wo
2 —2h(dw/2x), + w,
3 — 3h(Gw/Ox)) — $wy +3w, — jw, 3 (-1)" At
4 —4h(2w]Ox))— Pw, + 6w, —2w, + fw; cranes
5 —5h(Gw/Ax), — $$ + 10w, — Sw, + 3ws— pw,
a. 6 —6h(Gw/Ax) 9 — Fwy + 15w, — 10w, + 5w, — fw, + us

Similar expressions for w, can be obtained from this table by changing thesign of h, replacing
5 w, by we, w, by w;, etc.; in the error term backward differences replace forward differences
a and the factor (— 1)" becomes — 1.

8» For a boundary condition of the type (I. 5) which can here be written as

w+kdw/dx = K, (A. 10)
EB the fictitious point in figure 1 can now readily be obtained from table 1. Taking r = 4 for
example, it easily follows from the table and equation (A. 10) that the required expression
m - .
