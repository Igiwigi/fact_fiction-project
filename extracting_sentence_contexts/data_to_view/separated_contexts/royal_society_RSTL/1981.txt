Ir the influence of colour over heat attracted but little the attention of phi-
losophers employed in the investigation of the absorbing and radiating powers
of different substances, even when presented to their notice in anomalous
facts, which could not easily be explained on any other principle, it is not to
be wondered at, that the apparently far less appreciable influence of Colour on
Odours should have totally escaped notice. In point of fact, I am not aware
that the subject has hitherto been investigated, and know of no recorded facts
in which the influence of colour over odours has been pointed out. In at-
tempting to show from experiment that the colour of bodies in imbibing
odours is correlative with the power of colour oyer the absorption and radia-
tion of heat, I state a fact which, though new to science, is in admirable cor-
respondence with the known properties of light and heat. And though I may
not be able, from the nature of the substances snbjected to experiment, abs0-
lately to determine the amount of this connexion, I trust my imperfect investi-
gations may form the basis of new and better devised experiments, by directing
the attention of men of science to this hitherto untrodden field of inquiry.

My attention was first directed to the subject of odours, as connected with
colour, during my attendance at the anatomical rooms in the winter session
1830-1831.
