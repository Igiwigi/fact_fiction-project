No argu-
ment can be based on the observed numbers opposed to the view that crest, equally
with hernia, is linked with pile. The evidence for linkage in this case is weaker,
partly because of the smaller numbers, but principally because the genes concerned
are now in repulsion, instead of, as before, in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently
overlooked that data from F, generations in repulsion give far less information on
linkage than would the same number of observations from a cross in coupling. The data for crest and colour do, however, provide positive confirmation of our
view, in the entire absence of coloured birds without crest, which with close linkage
should be very rare. Without linkage the expectation in this class is 2-91.
