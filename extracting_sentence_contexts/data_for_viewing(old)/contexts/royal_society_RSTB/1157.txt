the “minimal” stimulus relatively to that of the “maximal” stimulus than would
otherwise be the case.
The following table gives the results of the galvanometric observations; each
deflection being produced by electrical changes in the nerve root, corresponding to the
Q localised excitation, for five seconds, with the interrupted induction current of the
