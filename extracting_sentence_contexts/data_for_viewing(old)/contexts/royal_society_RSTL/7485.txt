the real p-th root of K, then the very same transformed equation would be obtained
the real transformation & : y into #X : Y ; 80 that the equation obtained by the imagi
transformation, being also obtainable by a real transformation, has the 8ame cha
as the original equation. |

326. Similarly if p be even, if K be real and poxitive, the equation &”=K has a real root
k which may be substituted for the imaginary &, and the transformed equation will haye
the same character as the original equation ; but if K be negative, xy K=—1 (as may
be assumed without loss of generality), then there is no real transformation equiyalent
to the imaginary transformation, and the equation given by the imaginary transformation
has not of necessity the same character as the original equation; and there are in fact
cases in which the character is altered. Thus if p=2, and the original equation be
a(a*, y*)"=0, or (a, y*)"=0, then making the transformation & : y into iX : Y, the
transformed equation will be X(X?, —Y*)"=0 or (X?, —Y?*)"=0, giving imaginary roots
X*+aY?*=0 corresponding to real roots a*—ay*=0.

327. Applying what precedes to a quintic equation (@, . . . . Jz, y)*=0, this after any
real transformation whatever will assume the form (@', ...', y)=0; and the only
cases in which we can have an imaginary transformation producing a real equation of
an altered character is when this equation is (', 0, , 0, e, 0Xz", y)*=0(c not = 0), or
when it is («', 0, 0, 0, &, OXz, yY*=0, viz. when it is &(d'a"*+10ca%y*+5e4)=0, or
