presents the images for surfaces with four homogeneous wettability. The bottom row shows the
three characterized homogeneous wettability on the acrylic.

Figure 6a shows water collection rate per unit area of a flat surface at a 45Â° inclination
characterized by various wettability. Superhydrophobic and beetle-inspired surfaces were
prepared using 10 um and 7nm particles. The superhydrophobic surface and the beetle-inspired
surface are the only surfaces affected by the size of the particles. Figure 6b presents differences in
droplet formation on different types of surfaces after 1h.

The data shows that the higher the repellency (higher CA), the higher the water
collection. The decreasing order of the water collection rate per unit area on a homogeneous
wettability flat surface is superhydrophobic surface using 10m, hydrophobic, hydrophilic,
and superhydrophilic. This is attributed to the fact that the higher the repellency, the more
spherical the droplet shape will be, which results in a lower contact area between the droplet
and the surface. Therefore, less heat will be transferred into the droplet and less evaporation
will be observed. As shown in the optical images, large spherical droplets are formed on the
superhydrophobic surface which roll down. In the case of hydrophilic and superhydrophilic
surfaces, the droplets spread across the surface, leading to higher evaporation.

Another observed trend is that a beetle-inspired surface is better than a homogeneous
wettability surface. This is because of the heterogeneity; droplets can slide/roll at a faster rate,
allowing them to maintain a spherical droplet shape, leading to lesser evaporation.

Next, the effect of smaller particles was investigated. Smaller particles have lower pitch of
asperities on the surface as compared to the larger particles which affect the number of nucleation
