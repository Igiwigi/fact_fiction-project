observations of the three authors. Further, the pollen-analysis results seem to show much
affinity in composition between the basal samples of the upper peat and the peaty seams
within the intermediate sands and gravels. This affinity of pollen composition can be seen
in tables 6 and 7, and is similarly evident in the lower peat at Parsons Park (table 5).

At Parsons Park late-Glacial herbaceous pollen types occur in a tree-pollen sequence
suggestive of zone IV, and immediately above the gravel.

At Hawks Tor the base of the upper peat in both site 36 and site 42 A contains this same
characteristic assemblage.

In each of these instances the stratigraphic relation could be held to indicate that the
deposit was close to the late-Glacial, representing in fact that first laying down of organic
muds after the countryside recovered its vegetational carpet after cryoturbatic soil dis-
turbances of zone III. Ifso these layers must be regarded as belonging to zone IV.

Although the hypothesis that the base of the upper peat indeed belongs to zone IV can be
thus supported, it must be noted that a possibility remains that the immediate sands and
gravels may represent not only zone III, but also part or all of zone IV. There is little,
however, in the records of Allerod stratigraphy elsewhere in western Europe (even in
Ireland) to support such a view.

We are therefore forced to accept the possibility that zone IV is, indeed, represented at
Hawks Tor in the base of the upper peat, and that zone IV in this south-western peninsula
has a rather stronger element of warmth-demanding trees than it has in most parts of
