Flowable colloids can also jam up under stress (the cornstarch effect) and this

his concept and dilatancy, particularly in relation to density inhomogeneities,
is explored in a commentary by Haw (2009), based on remarks made at the
meeting and included in this Theme Issue. Progress may be possible using
he concept of effective temperature to describe the unpredictable part of
he particle motion under strong flow. This concept, while longstanding for
fast. granular flows (where it describes kinetic energy), is increasingly being
developed for slow flows and static systems, where instead it describes the
fact that a non-equilibrium system resides much higher up on the potential
energy (or free energy) landscape than would its equilibrium counterpart.
This avenue is explored in the contribution of Bi & Chakraborty (2009),

which introduces a new temperature-like variable conjugate to applied stress.
Effective temperature is one of several unresolved factors in the crossover in
