Everything below 4000K (log T < 3.6)
corresponds to the cold chromospheric bubbles. The minimum temperature achieved is lower
in the NGOL simulation than in the GOL simulations (enhanced with white circle E in figure 3b). In fact, the coolest temperatures for the NGOL simulation are controlled by an ad hoc heating term
in the Bifrost code which is introduced to avoid reaching temperatures lower than approximately
1600K since below this threshold the tabulated equation of state is no longer accurate [139]. While this ad hoc heating is crucial for the NGOL simulation, it is rarely necessary in both
simulations with ionâ€”neutral interaction effects since the cold chromospheric bubbles are not
cold enough to reach the temperature at which the ad hoc heating starts. The cold chromospheric
bubbles in the simulations with partial ionization effects are a few hundred degrees hotter
than in the NGOL simulation.
