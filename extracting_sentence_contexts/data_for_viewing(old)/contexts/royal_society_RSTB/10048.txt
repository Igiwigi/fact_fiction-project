profitably implement a non-quasi experimental design to
avoid this limitation to replicate this effect. Adultsâ€™ perform-
ance on the Transformer task further exemplifies this shift
towards greater knowledge of what information is necessary
to perform well. Adults correctly assessed the difficulty of
the task in terms of their performance, requesting social infor-
mation when they assessed it as more difficult and asocial
learning when they assessed it as less difficult. Such a finding
complements previous research, which has highlighted that
innovation is a relatively late-developing capacity [18-20]
and modification is a rare response for children [16]. Thus,
where it had previously been assumed children would
become better social information users with age [28], in fact
they become better information users in general with age, an
idea in line with recent arguments that social learning is an
extension of more general learning processes [29]. It is unclear
if the 5-year-olds who are requesting asocial learning could see
the solution or had learned that they were good at attempting
tasks themselves; again this is an avenue for future research.
In summary, cultural evolution requires the interplay of
sustaining traditions through social learning and creating
new behaviours through innovation [1]. The current results
show that, in an open choice design, young children and
adults have a preference for social learning rather than asocial
learning. Thus, our reliance on social learning is supported by a
