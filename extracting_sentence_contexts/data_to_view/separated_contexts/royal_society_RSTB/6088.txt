The material which is lost is water,
and the puparium does not compensate for high evaporation by burning fat or other
reserves, and so producing water of metabolism. The high mortality observed in
puparia of tachinoides at low humidities is therefore due to loss of water. The
puparium, in fact, behaves very like a fasting Cimex (MELLANBY, 19326). The effect of experimental conditions is much influenced by the age of the
puparium. The temperature which is fatal in middle life is some 2° C (3-6° F)
higher than that which is fatal at the beginning or end, Table XVII.
