SIGILLARIA SCUTELLATA AND OTHER EUSIGILLARIAN STEMS, ETC. 151

are extremely abundant in the Westphalian* division of the Upper Carboniferous, the
latter in the Stephanian and Permian.

We may now compare briefly Sigillaria scutellata with the other Sigillarias,
showing structure, which have previously been described.

The Clathrarian type, S. Menardi, originally described by Bronenrarr under the
name S. elegans, differs from our stem in the absence of ribs, and in the fact that the
leaf-bases are approximate, and more or less fused together. Internally, an important
distinetion is found in the fact that the primary wood does not form a continuous ring
with a crenulated outer margin, but is aggregated into a large number of distinct
strands, quite free laterally from one another. These, with the secondary wood, con-
stitute definite vascular bundles. The leaf-traces have also secondary wood, as
Renautrt has shown. They do not possess double xylem strands.

On the other hand, S. Menardi agrees closely with our species in the structure of
the elements of the periderm, and of the primary and secondary wood, with the
exception that we have not recognised, beyond doubt, the occurrence of spiral
tracheides in our stems.
