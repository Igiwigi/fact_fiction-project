3(C —]) with right Cauchy-Green tensor C = F'F, a measure of pure transformation strain could
be taken, for example, as 3(M'™M —I).

Microstructural descriptors can be subject to various types of physically motivated constraints,
the most obvious one being the restriction 0 < § <1 arising from the fact that € has to represent
a phase fraction. Also, in many SMAs, the austenite to martensite phase transformation can be
regarded as volume preserving and this motivates the constraint

detM=1. (2.2)

Moreover, other important constraints arise from the fact that macroscopic transformation strain
is physically limited by the overall variant structure. This can be stated in various ways, for
example in the form

(M'M -1)-(M'M~I) <kme, (2.3) a
where kmt is a constitutive quantity characteristic of the maximum transformation strain : =
achievable by a fully oriented martensite. Even if in most models km, is considered as a given [3
material constant, it can also be specified as a suitable function of the state variables (e.g. phase : =
fraction or even stress, as suggested in [7] and [8]). Other constraints can also be considered; for D8
example, if the overall deformation is volume preserving then this causes J = det F to be equal to : 3
one. : =

In summary, the configuration of the body is described in terms of four fields {x, #,&,M)} that : S
