This figure compares well with that recently determined at the National Physical
Laboratory from metrological measurements, which was 0-914,398,41 (Srars, Jonnson,
and Joy, loc. cit.). In making this comparison it must be remembered that the
value now found depends on entirely fresh series of metrological comparisons both
with the Imperial Standard Yard and with the International Metre. The concordance
actually found is better than might be expected under these conditions, and must, in

fact, be regarded as to some extent fortuitous. The metrological comparisons referred
to include :â€”

(a) the determination of the yard and metre lengths on the Laboratory nickel refer-
ence bar No. 184;

(6) the comparison of these lengths with those of the composite yard
gauges.

If the results of the comparisons included under (a) are combined with the known
ratios of the yard and metre lengths on No. 184, as in the previous paper, the value
found for the ratio is 0-914,398,26.
