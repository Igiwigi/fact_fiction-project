It appears that animals, indigenous to the
countries in which these plants are native, refuse to eat them in the earlier and
poisonous stages of growth. The part played by the glucoside in the general
metabolism of these plants and the origin and fate of the eyanogenetic group still
remain to be ascertained. The temporary presence in a plant of a considerable
quantity of a eyanogenetic glucoside, together with an enzyme capable of decomposing
it, appears to us to be a fact which must have an important biological meaning. As so much interest attaches to the subject from several points of view, we are
engaged in investigating the constituents of other plants which furnish prussic acid. Among them we may mention Phaseolus lunatus (seeds), Lotus australis, Manihot
utilissima, and Linum usitatissmum, as well as a number of little known plants
derived from the Colonies which have proved to be poisonous to cattle, some of which
may contain cyanogenetic glucosides.
