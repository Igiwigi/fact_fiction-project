I purpose examining this field of investigation in a general summary of all my electro-
physiological researches, which summary I hope s0on to be able to complete.

PART 1I.

Upon the Phenomena elicited by the passage of the Current through the Nerves of a
living Animal, or an Animal recently killed, according to the direction of the Current.

In my fourth memoir I took great pains to prove at length by the aid of experi-
ment, that the electric current transmitted along a nerve modifies the excitability of
the nerve in a manner differing widely according to the direction of the current ;
thus the direct current rapidly exhausts this excitability, while the inverse current
increases it. Starting from this fact, I hope that I have given a satisfactory theory
of electro-physiological phenomena.

Among the different experiments described on this head, I indicated one in parti-
cular which appears very singular, and which I have since studied in all its bearings.
The frog prepared in the ordinary manner, and divided in the pelvis, is placed astride
between two little glasses in which the reophores of a Faravar's pile of fifteen or
twenty elements were immersed. It is evident that one of the limbs is trayersed by
a direct current and the other by an inverse current, It is unnecessary to describe
here minutely the phases of the phenomena which present themselyes during twenty
or twenty-five minutes.

In the first place, the two limbs contract both on elosing and on opening the cir-
