By analogy with the lattice in plano one might have conjectured that the
Sesult would have been
g 1
2 (1) @2P BFA)? Sut this is not so, although the two functions do coincide as far as the coefficient of
& inclusive. In fact, the two expansions yield respectively
&
‘S| Lat 4a? + 7a + 140 + 230° + 410° + 6327 4+...,
oa Lat 4a* + 7a + 14x! + 230° + 420° + 632'+...,

he suceceding coetlicients becoming widely divergent. This at first seemed sur-

rising, but observe that analogy might also lead us to expect that, if the part-
Anagnitude be limited to /, the result would be

G+ 1+ 2° + 3% @+ 4).
