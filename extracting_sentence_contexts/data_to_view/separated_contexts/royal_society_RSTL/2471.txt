The appearance of these limbs (represented as perfectly disengaged in Mr.
TromesoN's Plate IT. fig. 11.) previous to the shedding of the cephalothoracic shield
and anterior parts of the body, is totally at variance with the principles of ecdysis
observable throughout the Annulosa, in which the locomotive organs, at least the
legs, are the last which are disengaged, and the thoracic shield of the inclosed animal
the first portion exposed to view. It would, in fact, be impossible for the Zoe to
disengage the thoracic limbs without the thorax itself being previously withdrawn
from its covering. 3. But we will look more precisely at the nature of this supposed disengagement
of the five pairs of legs.
