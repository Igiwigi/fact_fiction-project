And though the dentary almost touches the
squamosal it does not articulate with it, and we must thus place the animal among the
reptiles, though it is almost a mammal. Though the lower jaw resembles considerably that of a Cynodont, such as Gomphogna-
thus, the palate differs very greatly and there can be no hesitation in making this little
animal the type of a new Sub-order, and very little hesitation in stating that from a
member of this Sub-order the mammals have been derived. In fact this new type is much
nearer to the mammals than it is to any previously known Therapsid. In the present
paper I shall only speak of the palate. Though the palate is imperfect it can be restored with considerable confidence.
