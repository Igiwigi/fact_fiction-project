However, and unlike kernels, these do not have to be evolu-
tionary ancient (i.e. phylum or sub-phylum level for kernels,
down to species level for ChINs). Central to the applicability
of ChINs in discussing homology is the inherent modularity
of developmental systems. Different body parts and organs
develop, and are patterned, in a semi-autonomous fashion, a
fact known since the early days of experimental embryology
[27]. The division into discrete developmental sub-systems
allows for their individualized evolution, yet shared ChINs
underlying their formation in different organisms help us to
identify the resulting anatomical features as homologous. By introducing ChINs, a historical continuity is inferred by
means of their repetitive re-deployment during the embryogen-
esis of each following generation, while modifying their output
results in varying character states across species [26].
