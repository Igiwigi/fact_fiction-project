and monoclinic (double sulphates and selenates) series has shown that the system of
crystallisation has a preponderating effect on the angular differences, the latter being
the smaller the higher the degree of symmetry. It might have been expected, a
priori, that the monoclinic pair, say, K,Mg(SO,),.6H,O and Cs,Mg (SO,),.6H,O
would give closer angular values than the more symmetric rhombic pair, for example,
K,.SO, and Cs,SO,, since there is a common “dead weight”; but experience proves
the contrary, thus emphasising the effect of difference of system. Now the hexa-
gonal is a higher system in degree of symmetry than the rhombic, and the angular
differences (which the author found very small yet clear and unmistakeable in the
rhombic sulphates and selenates, although not so large as those shown in the mono-
clinic double salts) to be expected in the hexagonal system, other factors remaining
the same, are still smaller, and might easily fall within the limits 2/8’ or there-
abouts. JAEGER has, in fact, realised such a series, and his results are precisely what
the author (Turron) would have expected. It cannot be emphasised too strongly
(a) that the author's tables of angles of the whole 31 double sulphates, the 9 double
selenates yet investigated, and the whole 10 simple sulphates and selenates, show a
general correspondence of mean and calculated values within 2’ for the rhombic simple
salts and at most 5’ (probably only 3’) for the monoclinic double salts, and that the
constants given by the author for each individual salt can certainly be relied on within
-these narrow limits; and (4) that the deductions made by the author, such as the
important one regarding the observed progression with the atomic weight of the
alkali metal, are unquestionably valid, since the angular differences in question
between the salts under comparison are far and away greater than these small limits
of possible error, indeed in the maximum amounting to 2h’,
