The supposed branches mentioned in earlier memoirs have all turned out
— to be either roots or petioles. We are, therefore, not justified in assuming the
sb presence of a highly developed system of ramification such as would be necessary to
= account for the existence of branches of various orders,
s The explanation we would suggest is, that the small specimens, with a continuous
& ting of primary wood, may represent the basal, first developed portions of normal stems. +3 Osmunda, as is well known, resembles Lyginodendron in the fact that the normal
% stem possesses a ring of collateral bundles, which are distinct, so far as their xylem is
= concerned, M, Lecrerc pu Saston in his interesting memoir on the development of
= the stem in Ferns, has shown that the lower internodes of the stem of Osmunda have
£ a continuous ring of wood enclosing the small pith, this ring being only interrupted
g at the nodes. Itis only in the later-developed part of the stem that the pith enlarges
£ and the bundles become permanently distinct.t
%  Acsimilar stage is passed through by the stems of many other ferns. Until we
# have been able to trace the transition in one and the same stem of Lyginodendron
3 from the small pith and continuous xylem of the basal portion to the large pith and
8 separate bundles of the upper stem, our suggestion must remain an hypothesis.
