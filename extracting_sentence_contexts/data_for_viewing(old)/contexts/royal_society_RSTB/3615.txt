Committee for the study of the Tertiary and Secondary Floras of Britain (see
GarpNeR and others, 1886), and a number of others were described from time to time
by CARRUTHERS.

In his ‘Catalogue of the Wealden Flora, Sewarp (1894-5) includes several
plants from Potton and Leighton Buzzard, but these are truly Wealden in all
probability, for though they occur in the Lower Greensand deposits they have every

indication of being derived fossils. Srwanrp, 1895, p. 166, says: “The exact age of
fossils from these beds must be a matter of some uncertainty, owing to the fact of
many of them being clearly derived forms; it may be noted, however, that some
of the plant fossils from Potton appear to be specifically identical with Wealden
types.” In his ‘Catalogue’ also Sewarp includes some other Lower Greensand
plants from different localities which probably are not derived but are really of Lower
Greensand age. This was probably largely a matter of convenience, as at that time
the extent and interest of the true Lower Greensand flora was unsuspected.
Stratigraphical geologists distinguish between the Wealden and the Lower Green-
sand, and from data in my possession but still unpublished I should incline also to
distinguish sharply between the floras of the two periods, The discovery of the
present Angiosperms is in itself sufficient basis for this, for, as is well known, the
Wealden flora is characteristically of the older facies, and devoid of Angiosperms.
SEWARD, 1895, p. 240, says: “ ... we search in vain among the abundant samples
