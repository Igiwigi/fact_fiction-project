The large amount of attention which has been bestowed on the action of nitrite
amyl during the last thirty years, has established certain facts regarding it which
recognised on all hands; but it has left us in considerable doubt as to the oceurre
of other phenomena which are described by some investigators, but questioned |
others. The explanation of even the most evident nitrite effect, viz., the fall

The principle observed in the experiments, which it seemed advisable to make,
order to obtain further information on the action of nitrates, has been to carefi

After briefly sketching the history of previous investigations with the so-call
amyl nitrite, in so far as they bear upon the scope of our inquiry, the action of pu
