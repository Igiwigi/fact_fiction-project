Resumse of the ulterior theory of the double functions.

23. The ulterior theory of the double functions is intended to be carried out on the

like plan. As regards these, it is to be observed here that we have not only the

16 equations leading to linear relations between the squared functions, but that the

remaining 240 equations lead also to linear relations between binary products of

different functions. We have thus between the 16 functions a system of quadric

relations, which in fact determine the ratios of the 16 functions in terms of two

variable parameters #, y. (The 16 functions are thus the coordinates of a point on

a quadri-quadric two-fold locus in 15-dimensional space.) The forms depend upon six
