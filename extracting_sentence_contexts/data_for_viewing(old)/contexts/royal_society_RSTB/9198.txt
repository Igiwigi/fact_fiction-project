Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to clinical medicine and public health,
not only in the UK but internationally [1-3]. Antibiotics are not only essential
for the treatment of classical infections such as bacterial pneumonia, sepsis or
meningitis, tuberculosis (TB) or gonorrhoea, but also opportunistic infections

threat, interventions that may occur in patients predisposed to infection, particularly in hospital. It is
an interesting paradox that many advances in medical care have as an unintended
Author for correspondence: consequence, the fact that patients become more prone to contracting infections,

often caused by pathogens of low virulence that pose little threat to healthy
people. For example, oncology patients may suffer bouts of neutropenia due to
the cytotoxic drugs they receive as part of their cancer therapy, whereas organ
transplant recipients are immunosuppressed and hence less able to fight off infec-
tion due to the drugs they receive to prevent organ rejection. Similarly, many
medical procedures such as insertion of intravascular or urinary catheters, intuba-
tion or surgery breach the bodyâ€™s natural barriers to infection and allow
pathogens direct access to sites such as the bloodstream, urinary tract, lung or
abdominal cavity. As an added complication, patients requiring medical care
are clustered together in hospital wards, with the result that individual patients
who develop infections readily serve as a source of cross-infection to other
