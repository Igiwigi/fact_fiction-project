ETTATI Ty mantis brain contains multiple classes of disparity-sensitive

neurons in the mantis brain, with binocular information com-
binocular neurons, including some sending feedback to ear-
motoneuron threshold for lier visual areas [109,110]. Thus, the full circuitry actually
H strike subserving mantis stereopsis is in fact more complex than
any of the models discussed in this paper.

As shown above, the single-sensor model gives a good
account of current data on mantis striking behaviour, includ-
ing the preference for size, vertical and horizontal disparity,
and the lack of response to ghost matches. If so much is
achieved by a single disparity sensor, why does the mantis
