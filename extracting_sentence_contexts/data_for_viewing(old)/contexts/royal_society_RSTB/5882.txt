man. The uninterrupted course of the midfrontal fissure (7) in Pithecanthropus is also
found in Rhodesian man and Neanderthal man (Diisseldorf and La Quina). In these
casts it runs in a twofold curve from the inferior precentral* into the direction of the
frontomarginal (9) with which it may connect, or nearly connect,} as it does in
Pithecanthropus.

A marked feature of this sulcus, which may be derived from the horizontal branch of the
arcuate fissure in monkeys, is, in recent man, its breaking up into several parts, usually
arches, and losing its connection with the precentral; consequently the human
midfrontal is often overlooked, and if it is complete it is sometimes taken for the superior
frontal.

It is, however, an interesting fact that the uninterrupted condition of the midfrontal
(7) and its continuity with the inferior precentral (5) by the arch (6) is so evident in some
lower palzolithic casts, and that amongst recent human races this occurs more in dolicho-
cephalic than in brachycephalic brains and especially in the dolichocephalic Negroes.
This had already impressed Serei (1909)t, who gave an excellent account of the Herero
brain.

I do not understand the statement made by Poynrer and Kraan (loc. cit. infra, p. 194) that in 75 per
cent. of their hemispheres (13 brains) the midfrontal is represented by shallow irregular elements and that
there is nothing to impress one with the importance attributed to this suleus by EBERSTALLER.

Though interrupted in their figs. 1, 3 and 5 the fissure is extremely evident. In figs. 1 and 3 also, its con-
nection (my 6) with the inferior precentral is clear. In their figs. 1 and 3 they probably labelled a part of
