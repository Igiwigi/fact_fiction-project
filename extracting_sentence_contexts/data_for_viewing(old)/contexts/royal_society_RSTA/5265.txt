ij i j i j i
As a consequence, we obtain a uniform bound on the yth moment of the discrete minimizers.
As a result, the minimizing sequence corresponding to the associated atomic measures is tight,
leading also towards a global minimizer of E[j].

3. Further remarks in one dimension

Here, we concentrate on the one-dimensional case (d = 1) for more refined properties.

(a) Confinement of discrete global minimizers

We check first how sharp are the conditions on the exponents of the potential to obtain the
confinement of global discrete minimizers independently of 1. In fact, when the potential is very
repulsive at the origin, we can show that a uniform bound in n of the diameter of the global
minimizers in the discrete setting does not hold. If x is a minimizer of E;,(x), we always assume
that the labelling of the x; is in increasing order: x1 <x2 <+++<Xn.

Theorem 3.1. Suppose a < y <0 and a < —2. If x is a minimizer of Ey, then there exists a constant
Ca,y such that, for n large enough,

Xp — Xp > Cyynt*/e

holds.
