weeks' quiet caused them to sink, and leave the supernatant liquid clear. It may be
worth remarking that some rabbit-infusions have shown a decided opalescence, while
others have been perfectly clear. The same remark applies to turnip-infusions, 8ome of
which have been found as clear as distilled water, while in general a slight opalescence
is not to be got rid of by filtering.

These later experiments are quite in harmony with the earlier ones. Not one of this
cloud of witnesses testifies in favour of Dr. Basr1\N. Not a single flask of the multitude
manifests the deportment alleged by him to be a matter of common observation. If
the power of spontaneous generation be a scientific verity, surely amid opportunities 80
multiplied and various it must have asserted itself. That the infusions employed were
not © degraded ” by the boiling 80 as to be incapable of supporting life, was proved by
the fact that exposed tubes containing the same infusious, treated in precisely the same
way, resolved themselves with the usnal speed into Bacterial 8warms. The conclusion
to which these results point is, that here, as elsewhere, Dr. Ba8T1aN has allowed the
gravest errors to invade his experimental work.

d 23. Conditions as to the Temperature and Strength of Infusions.

In connexion with these experiments, I have sought, to the best of my ability, to meet
every condition and requirement laid down by others as essential to 8uccess. With regard
to warmth, a temperature of 90* was generally attainable in our laboratory, while
on certain days of mild weather without, and in favourable positions within, the tem-
perature to which the infusions were subjected reached over 100? Fan. As Dr. BASTIAN,
however, has recently laid considerable stress on warmth, though most of his results
