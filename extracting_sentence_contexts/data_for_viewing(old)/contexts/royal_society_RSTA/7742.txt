The magnetometer room was kept within +-0-5° C of a constant temperature by means
of a commercial thermostatic element, which controlled a 400 W heating system consisting
of eight underrun 150W lamp bulbs disposed around the periphery of the floor. In the
later experiments a small commercial squirrel cage fan in one corner of the room served to
circulate the air slowly, and so to keep the temperature of the room uniform. Usually the
spot position varied by 10 to 100mm for 1°C change in room temperature. This rapid

"variation resulted from a considerable degree of magnetic control due to magnetic impurities
in the constructional materials of the magnetometer case. The large magnitude of the effect
was somewhat surprising, but was probably due to the fact that the equilibrium position

f the anti-vibration suspension is very sensitive to temperature. A shift of this position
alters the spatial relation of the magnetometer itself to the slightly magnetic parts of the
ase surrounding it, and so alters the zero position of the spot.
