noticed at this point on the coast. The north-east trend of this line is nearly parallel
to the straight south-east coast of Montserrat, from Shoe Rock to Roche Bluff, which
is suggestive of a fault feature.

One of the most important active soufriéres, Gage’s Lower, does not lie on either
of these lines, but is situated about 500 yards to the north-west of that first mentioned.
In the main west-north-westerly ghaut south of Gage’s, signs of fumarole activity
extend a little way up the ghaut from Gage’s Lower soufriére (situated in its right
bank) and are to be seen again (e.g. hot springs) for some little way before reaching
Gage’s Upper soufriére (located mainly in the left bank). For some way below these
hot springs the stream has encrusted its bed heavily with iron oxides.

The existence of another line of crustal weakness is suggested by the fact that Gage’s
Lower, Spring Ghaut, and Galway’s soufriéres are situated very nearly on a line
trending about E. 30°S. from Garibaldi Hill, through St George’s Hill to the acid
bandaite intrusion of the Roche Bluff centre, south-west of Landing Bay. This direction
is parallel to the general trends of the north-east coasts of South America and Cuba.

(ii) Gaseous products. Hydrogen sulphide is the most obvious gaseous emanation at
all the centres. Steam is also evolved, except at Cow Hill New and Spring Ghaut
soufriéres. Mulcair soufriére may also be an exception in this respect; I saw it only
once from some distance offshore. At those soufriéres where it is liberated, the rising
steam can, as a rule, be seen from a considerable distance.

When the wind was blowing from the direction of Gage’s or Galway’s soufriéres,
