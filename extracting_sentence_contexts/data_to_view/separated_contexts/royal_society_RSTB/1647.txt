Thus, Plate 2, fig. 18, is the response of the: whole strip obtained just before such
division, whilst Plate 1, fig. 6, is that obtained from a portion of this strip imme-
diately after the nerve division, In both cases the organ strip was similarly
connected directly to the electrometer shunted by a resistance of 80 ohms, the
temperature was 5° C., and this nerve was excited 1 centim. from its point of entry. A glance at these two facsimile records will show the striking differences just referred
to, and demonstrate the fact that the production of the peripheral rhythm is
dependent as a first essential factor upon the excitability of the tissue. The influence
of temperature upon the rate of the rhythm (see Section 5) affords further evidence
of this sufficiently obvious fact. Although, in accordance with the preceding remarks, the peripheral rhythm is
essentially bound up with the excitability of the organ, the causative factor in its
production appears to be the excitation of the organ by its own electrical response,
thus resembling the similar phenomenon observed by Kiuye and others in the case
of the Sartorius muscle when the upper end is squeezed.* As is well known the
Sartorius muscle under these circumstances responds to a single stimulus by a
prolonged tetanus, due to self-excitation by the excitatory electrical changes in its
own fibres. That this factor is operative in the present instance is strikingly brought
out by the following three series of experiments.
