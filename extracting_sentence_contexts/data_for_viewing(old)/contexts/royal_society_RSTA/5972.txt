denotes the general heat flow. Note that the length scales /2at cancel out because of (4.2). In the
case of the Burgers equation, this last form provides the general solution.

Before closing this subsection it may be in order to emphasize the following fact. In terms
of the scaled velocity potential @(&), the exact solution is given by = —2v log(1 — (1/2v)¥),
whose leading-order approximation agrees with the scaled heat flow @() ~ Ge). This confirms
the near-identity nature of ®(é).

(b) 2D Navier-Stokes equations

In 2D incompressible flows, the source-type solution is given by the Burgers vortex, which is not
only near-Gaussian, but also exactly Gaussian. Because of this peculiarity, the final steady state
does not contain any useful information regarding the nonlinear terms. Hence, it is impossible
to lift (or generalize) the final state to find a more general class of solutions and we end up with
obtaining the linearized solution only. Curiously enough the better understood 2D Navier-Stokes
equations defy the current approach to gain some information about their solutions.
