Devonian rocks, and often placed under the form-name Hostimella sp. None have
detailed features of agreement such as justified the unqualified use of this name
for examples previously described from the Centennial Beds (LANG and Cookson,
1930), though some of them exhibit a sufficiently close general resemblance. â€˜The
proportions and appearance of others indicate derivation from different kinds of
plants. In the circumstances it seems best to avoid not only naming, but too
definite comparisons of these unsatisfactory remains, and to await discoveries of
better material.

ConcLusION

The importance of the highly organized land-plants described in this paper lies
in the fact that their Silurian age is established by the occurrence along with them
of Monograptus. The graptolites from two localities have been determined by
Dr. Exes, and shown to indicate conclusively that the plant-containing beds

are there Lower Ludlow. It might perhaps be reasonably assumed that this will
apply to the other localities, but, since so far geologists have regarded these as at a
still earlier Silurian horizon, the question is left open by taking the age of this flora
as Silurian and not younger than the Lower Ludlow. The three types of plant-
remains have been discussed severally, and only brief reference to some general
bearings of them is necessary here.
