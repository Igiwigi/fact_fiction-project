BW A concentrated solution of this acid dissolves pure zinc without eyolution of hydrogen
& gas, and the liquid at the same time becomes perceptibly warm ; the reaction very 8001
4 ceases. Even if metal and acid be left in contact for a day or two at ordinary tempera-
EZ tures, the liquid will still contain a considerable portion of unchanged glyoxylic acid. E The process may be accelerated, and may in fact be completed in the course of eight or
4 ten hours, by exposing the reacting substances to a temperature of about 80" C. The
Z previously colourless liquid will then have assumed a yellow colour, and does no longer
2 contain glyoxylic acid or glyoxylate of zinc. The pieces of undissolved zinc are found
5 to be covered with a small quantity of a white crystalline powder.
