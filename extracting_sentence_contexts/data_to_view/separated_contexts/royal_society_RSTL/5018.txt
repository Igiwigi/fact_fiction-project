Nevertheless it seemed to me less improbable that the refrangibility should have
changed, than that the undulatory theory should have been found at fault. And
when I reflected onthe extreme simplicity of the whole explanation if only this one
supposition be admitted, I could not help feeling a strong expectation that it would
turn out to be true. In fact, we have only to suppose that the invisible rays beyond
the extreme violet give rise by internal dispersion to others which fall within the limits
of refrangibility between which the retina of the human eye is affected, and the expla-
nation is obvious. The narrowness of the blue band observed by Sir Joux Herscner
would merely indicate that the fluid, though highly transparent with regard to the
visible rays, was nearly opake with regard to the invisible. According to the law of
continuity, the passage from almost perfect transparency to a high degree of opacity
would not take place abruptly ; and thus rays of intermediate refrangibilities might
produce the blue gleam noticed by Sir Joan Herscnsr, or the blue cylinder, or
rather cone, observed by Sir Davip BrewsTeErR.
