At the pore scale, one of the main concerns is the presence of water. Water, naturally present or
apparently lost during the initial fracturing operations, predominantly resides in the matrix [26]. From an environmental point of view, this fact suggests that it is unlikely that water will leave
the shale formation and will not impact the water resources outside the formation if fractures do
not extend beyond the shale formation. However, it has a negative impact on the extraction of
hydrocarbons due to the possibility of flow blocking. Our results suggest that use of scCO2 or
other miscible solvents in re-stimulation operations can increase of the life of fracking wells.
