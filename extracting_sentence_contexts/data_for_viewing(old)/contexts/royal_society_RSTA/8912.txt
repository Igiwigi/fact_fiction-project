A and B being unequal, that is, on the stress-optical coefficients for the viscous and
elastic parts of the stress being different.

(2) The existence of a sudden change of retardation on loading and unloading implies
that B is not zero, that is the viscous part of the stress must be optically active.

(3) The creep, as well as the initial retardation, must be proportional to the load
applied.

§ 7. Comparison of Provisional Theory with Observation.

The theory described above gives, on the whole, a fairly accurate qualitative descrip-
tion of the facts observed. When, however, the observations of optical creep came to
be plotted to time and it was attempted to fit to the curves formule of the type

it rapidly became apparent that no such formula could give even an approximate fit.
