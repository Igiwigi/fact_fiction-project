Assessments of brain energy budget using a var-
iety of approaches (for review, see [5]) would suggest that
60-80% of overall brain energy consumption is devoted to
spike-generated glutamate cycling and, hence, neural signalling
processes involving principal cells. The basis for this estimate,
however, should be viewed with caution for several reasons. First, it is important to realize that most of the ongoing
electrical activity of the neocortex is, in fact, subthreshold
depolarizations rather than action potential firing ([9], see
also [10]). Second, early estimates of the cost of spikes fell
far short of explaining the cost of brain function [11]. Also,
current estimates leave for future consideration the demands
placed on the brainâ€™s energy budget by the activity of inhibi-
tory interneurons [12-17], astrocytes [18,19] and other
supporting cells [20].
