2 extreme red, the line of yellow, bright green, bright blue, and
Z extreme violet, I found to be inversely as the numbers 27, go,
Z 35, 40, and 45, respectively. In consequence of Dr. WoLLASTON'S
D correction of the description of the prismatic spectrum, com-
2 pared with these observations, it becomes necessary to modify
5 the supposition that I advanced in the last Barertan lecture,
S respecting the proportions of the sympathetic fibres of the
z retina; substituting red, green, and violet, for red, yellow, and
5 blue, and the numbers 7, 6, and 5, for 8, 7, and 6.

= The same prismatic analysis of the colours of thin plates,
SZ appears to furnish a satisfactory explanation of the subdivision
= of the light of the lower part of a candle: for, in fact, the light
E transmitted through every part 6f a thin plate, is divided in a

similar manner into distinct portions, increasing in number with
the thickness of the plate, until they become too- minute to be
visible. At the thickness corresponding to the ninth or tenth
portion of red light, the number of portions of different colours
is five; and their proportions, as' exhibited by refraction, are
nearly the same as in the light of'a candle, the violet being the
