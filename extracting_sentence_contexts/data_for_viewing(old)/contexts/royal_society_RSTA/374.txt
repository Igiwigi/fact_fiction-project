2 years. There are two points to highlight with this chart. First, there is a fan
around the historical data, to the left of the black vertical line. That reflects
the fact that output data are frequently revised over time—sometimes heavily.
The CPI, in contrast, is rarely revised. The chart shows that there was a lot of
uncertainty about the past data. The MPC believes it is more likely than not that
current vintages of data will be revised up slightly. But the big picture of a large
decline in output was expected to remain even in the mature data. Uncertainty
about the past is an important component of our uncertainty about the future,
and is reflected in the forward-looking part of the GDP fan, to the right of the
black vertical line. The second point is that the forecast part of the chart shows
that a return to growth was thought likely. But if you just focused on this chart
you might feel that the MPC was quite optimistic in expecting such a rebound
in growth after a painful, deep recession.

In some ways, that is true. But by itself that would be a misleading inference.
