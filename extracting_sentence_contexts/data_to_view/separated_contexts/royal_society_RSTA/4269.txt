Introduction

The quest for achieving ever more accurate determinations of the Boltzmann constant k, to :
support a new definition of the kelvin, has proved an efficient driver towards the improvement a
of primary thermometry with different experimental methods. The measure of this progress is [3
illustrated by the remarkable reduction of the uncertainty associated with the determination of iB
the physical properties which characterize a macroscopic system in thermal equilibrium at a :
particular thermodynamic temperature T. In fact, the energy kT /2 associated with one degree of DA
freedom of such a system can presently be estimated with a relative overall uncertainty of a few Dw
parts per million (ppm) using a variety of different techniques [1]. (Unless otherwise stated, all :
uncertainties in this work are standard uncertainties with coverage factor k = 1 corresponding toa a
68% confidence interval.) Most notably, in the case of acoustic gas thermometry (AGT), the relative :s
uncertainty in the measurement of the internal kinetic energy of a dilute gas is lower than 1 ppm :
[2], competing with the precision achieved by the current temperature scale, the International
Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) [3], based on the use of fixed points and platinum resistance
thermometry. Here, after reviewing the recent progress achieved in the development of several primary
thermometry methods, we present some preliminary results obtained, mainly by AGT and
dielectric constant gas thermometry (DCGT), in the determination of the differences (T — To9),
where To9 is the formal approximation to T determined from ITS-90 [3]. In particular, we consider
whether recent measurements may resolve some inconsistencies in previous determinations [4],
and prepare the ground for a future revised temperature scale, the so-called ITS-202x.
