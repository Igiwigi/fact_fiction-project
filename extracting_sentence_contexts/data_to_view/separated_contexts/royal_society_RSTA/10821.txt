In the stream-
line diagram, on account of the straight-line boundary on the left, the lines are forced
to go on ina downward direction. Yet it is curious to note the strong twist towards
the left which the lines exhibit immediately after leaving the teeth, and which
indicates the direction in which the flow would naturally continue if not subject to

the artificial constraint just mentioned. An objection which might be raised in connection with some of the diagrams is the
fact that in those cases where the induction varies from point to point, the permea-
bility in any actual magnetic substance is also variable. In so far as this is the case,
of course the stream-line diagrams do not afford a rigid solution of the problem. But
it must be remembered that there are many cases in which the magnetic intensity
is either so weak or so strong that the permeability does not vary greatly within
certain limits of the induction.
