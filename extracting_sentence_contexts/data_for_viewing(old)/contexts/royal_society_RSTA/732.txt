where L is the unknown (half-)length of the buckled region, $€ [0,1] is a scaled arclength
coordinate, and P = P/(Eh*/12) and Q = Q/(Eh*/12) are dimensionless components of the tension.
We choose a global Cartesian coordinate system with origin at the centre of the circle.

The boundary conditions are that on the symmetry line (s=0) 6 =0 and x=0; whereas at
the contact point (s = 1) 6 =a and y= ~—r cosa, where r is the radius of the bounding circle. The
values P and Q are constant from the equilibrium of forces, but their values are unknown, as is
the length L. To determine the unknown tension components, we use the facts that the curvature
of the beam must match the curvature at the contact point, 00/08 =L/r at s=1; and that the
symmetry condition at s = 0 means that the vertical component of the tension must be zero. (Note
that it is easier to locate the buckled solution branch numerically if the vertical position of the
beam at s=0 is treated as an additional unknown Y with the associated equation that Q = 0.)
The unknown length L is found from the constraint that at s=1, x =rsina. Solving this set of
equations and constraints using quadratic finite elements via oomph-1 ib, we find a post-buckled
solution for given a if we insist that Y > —r.

To link this constructed solution to the undeformed ring, we treat a as an unknown with
the constraint that the length change due to axial strain induced by the tension (assuming a
