integrals with real-valued integrands against the Itd integrator dX, resulting in a Hilbert-space decomposition analogous to
(2.3) but involving only real Hilbert spaces.


An important joint property of the Brownian motions P and Q is that, despite their non-
commutativity, increments of P commute with increments of Q over disjoint intervals. Indeed,
if0<v <u <t<s <1, then, informally,

[P(s) — P(t), Qu) — Q@)]
= [P(s), Q@)] — [P(s), Q()] — [P(H, Q@)] + [PO), Q)]
= —2iu + 2iv + 2iu — 2iv =0.

In fact, not only do the increments generate commuting von Neumann algebras but also they are
independent in the sense that, for arbitrary real x, y,

EfeiexPO)-PO)+HQW)—-QO))] = @(oS—H)/2)8-H0*(u—w) 2)
= EfeiP-PO)RTeH(Q)-QE), :=

as is seen by ‘splitting’ [7,15] the Fock space D(L2((0, 1])) between u and f. This strong independent iB
increments property leads on to a corresponding genuinely non-commutative strong Markov DG
property for planar quantum Brownian motion [16] and a corresponding splitting at each Markov 78
time [17]. Dw
