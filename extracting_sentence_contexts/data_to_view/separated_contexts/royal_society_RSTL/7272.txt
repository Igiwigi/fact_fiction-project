There seems to be some innaty |
though inscrutable difference in the intimate constitution of their tissues, into the natuy
of which we may never be enabled to penetrate, even with the most perfect instrumey
the optician could devise. ZOOLOGICAL POSITION AND AFFINITIES. Having now pretty fully explained the anatomy of the Nematoids, we shall be abls,
with the aid of the many new facts revealed concerning their structure, to consider the
question of their affinities and homologies with more chance of success than formerly,
8 that we may hope to throw some light upon this difficult 8ubject. Hitherto, t6
those anatomists who penetrate beyond mere external form, the Nematoids have been
regarded almost as an outlying group, having no definite relationship with other
animals, and admitting only of a provisional location "in the convenient though
utterly artificial class Entozoa. In the first volume of his © Elements of Comparative
Anatomy '* recently published, Professor HuxLEY has done much to elucidate the
homologies of the *Annuloid” animals; and as well from the philosophic nature of
his views as from the fact that he is the latest writer of note who has treated on the
classification of the Animal Kingdom, it seems desirable for me briefly to refer to some
of these views in order that we may be able more fully to appreciate the state of the
question concerning the affinities of the Nematoids.
