It is true that the existing figures for the refraction equivalents show many excep-
tions to this rule; but the figures themselves are so untrustworthy that anomalies do
not destroy the general effect of the evidence. The second, and perhaps more interesting, point is that the refractivities of the
different members of the same chemical family are, within the limits of experimental
error, related in the ratios of small integers. This fact, observed first in the family
of the inert gases, is equally true in that of the halogens, and, if the present results
are approximately correct, is now shown to exist between the two first members of
the families of O and N respectively. The case then stands thus :â€”The indices of fourteen elements have been measured
in the gaseous state. *
