the Platyrhine Monkeys, have a fundus stippled all over with minute brown dots.
The appearance is very similar to that which we shall find in the Lemuride, so that,
but for the great distinction due to the presence of a macula, the Nyctipitheci closely
approach the higher forms of the Prosimis, a coincidence probably due to their
nocturnal habits.

All the Simiz have invariably circular pupils, which dilate to mydriatics and
contract to myotics, convergence, and light, and in that respect there is no difference
except in degree between Man and the other Simiw. The Simi are the only
Mammals which have the visual axes parallel, and which possess the power of con-
vergence, factors which seem to be the necessary consequence of the presence of a
macula, This convergence is longest sustained in Man, most of the Monkeys being
only able to converge for a very short period. In fact, the Mandril (Cynocephalus
mormon), the Black Ape (Cynopithecus niger), and the Red Howler (Mycetes seni-
culus) are the only Monkeys in which I have observed any sustained convergence.

12 DR. G. L. JOHNSON ON THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY

The refraction of all the Monkeys is similar to that of savage Man, viz., slight hyper-
metropia without astigmatism, the only exception being the Mandrils and Drills,
which are all myopic to the extent of 3D to6D.* I have examined six Mandrils
and one Drill, and found them all myopic, and in both eyes equally. The Membrana
