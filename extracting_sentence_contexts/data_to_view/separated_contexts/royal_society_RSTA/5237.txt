In these simulations,
the material forming the Moon is mostly derived from Theia. This feature of successful Giant
Impact simulations has been the hardest to reconcile with geochemical data. The fact that the
isotopic compositions of silicate Earth and Moon are so similar despite evidence that other objects
are different provides evidence that either:

(1) The innermost Solar System from which these two objects formed was not so
heterogeneous after all or Theia accreted at a similar heliocentric distance to the Earth
[7,8].

or

(2) The atoms of the Moon were derived from the Earth after core formation and the
‘traditional’ simulations are incorrect [9-11]. New dynamic models have been proposed
in which the angular momentum constraint is violated (i.e. the Earth-Moon system began
with over twice its current angular momentum) and the excess is extracted by a resonance
involving the Sun [10].

or

(3) There was isotopic equilibration between the atoms in the lunar accretion disc and those
in the Earth’s magma ocean [12]. Determining which of these models is correct is crucial to understanding, not just the formation of
the Moon itself, but also the conditions under which terrestrial planets more generally accreted.
