Contrary to our third hypothesis (figure 1d), however, there to more than one perturbation might mean that the interactive
was little evidence that a clade that responds positively or effects of multiple global changes on microbial composition
negatively to one type of perturbation will also respond to might be minimal. On the other hand, the evidence of legacy

where the same taxonomic group responded consistently to response to one perturbation influences the response to future

more than one perturbation type (figure 4). This result did perturbations [11,28,35,58], perhaps suggests the opposite.
