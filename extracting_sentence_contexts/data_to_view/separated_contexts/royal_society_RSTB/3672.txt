This is also the case with the right
habenular ganglion and with the median portion of the ganglion above the habenular
commissure. Hence it seems not impossible that all three may be directly connected
with the main trunk of the left pineal nerve. The fact, however, that the left
habenular ganglion is produced upwards into the wall of the dorsal sac in such a
characteristic manner at the point where it receives the nerve-fibres from the latter in
special abundance (figs. 54, 61, 7. p. e.), affords strong evidence that it receives at any
rate the greater part of the fibres of the left pineal nerve. It is also possible that some of the fibres of the left pineal nerve may run
downwards along the wall of the pineal sac to join the upper end of the right pineal
nerve (tractus pinealis) where the latter enters the wall of the pineal sac, but owing
to the difficulty of distinguishing these fibres from the connective tissue of the pia
mater in this region, I have not been able to satisfy myself on this point.
