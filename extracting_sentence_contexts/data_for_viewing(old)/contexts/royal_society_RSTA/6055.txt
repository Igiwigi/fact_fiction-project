where p(N)-the probability that the i-th row of M has exactly N non-zero distributed entries over
the S — 1 off-diagonal elements-is a binomial distribution, since the outcome in each entry of M


is a Bernoulli trial with probability C

where the factor N in the variance comes from the fact that z; is the sum of N normally distributed
