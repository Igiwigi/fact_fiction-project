with a simple (first-order) social norm that prizes cooperation
and penalizes the loner and defection choices through bad repu-
tations. By comparing the effect of social norms differing by the
relative reputations they assign to defectors and loners, we
explore the strategic exchanges between punishment and repu-
tation. Similarly to Panchanathan & Boyd [47], we consider
ephemeral groups of agents that interact repeatedly during
each time period and are then reshuffled.

We find that while reputation alone mildly increases
cooperation, and punishment alone does not, the two mech-
anisms synergistically interact, leading to high cooperation.
Our findings stem from the fact that reputation emerges as
a partial substitute for punishment, thus making all types
of punishment less necessary. Our results indicate a way
through which social groups can sustain cooperation despite
the presence of anti-social punishment.

2. The model

A fully-mixed population of N agents play the OPGG in ran-
domly chosen groups of n > 4 as in Hauert [11]. During each
interaction, players are given the choice between cooperating
C), defecting (D) or abstaining from the game (L). Coopera-
tors incur a cost c to participate and contribute towards the
