be expressed by the terms multitude and complexity. As a molecule of multitude, amy-
lene, for example, exceeds alcohol; as a molecule of complexity, alcohol exceeds
amylene; and in this case, as regards radiant and absorbent power, the complexity is
more than a match for the multitude. The same remarks may be made with refer-
ence to sulpharic and formic ether: the former excels in multitude, the latter in com-
plexity, the excess in the one case almost exactly balancing that in the other. Adding
two atoms of hydrogen and one of carbon to the formic ether, we obtain acetic ether,
and by this addition the balance is turned; for though acetic ether falls short of 8ul-
phuric ether in multitude, it transcends it in absorbent and radiant power. Outstand-
ing from all others, when equal yolumes are compared, and signalizing itself by the
enormous magnitude of its absorption, we have boracic ether, each molecule of which
embraces no less than 25 atoms. The time now at my disposal enables me to do little
more than glance at these singular facts ; but I must direct the attention of chemists to
the water molecule: its power as a radiant and an absorbent is perfectly unprecedented
and anomalous, if the usually recognized formula be correct.

In Table IIL. a fact is revealed which is worth a little further attention. The mea-
$urements there recorded show that the absorption of a layer of iodide of methyl,
strongly coloured with iodine (which, doubtless, had been liberated by the action of
light), was precisely the same as that of a perfectly transparent layer of the liquid.
