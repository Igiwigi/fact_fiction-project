This experiment presents the same results as the preceding
one; and shows, that the observed fact is not influenced by
the eccentric position of the source of heat. As the silver wire, from which the needles were sus-
pended, had been unwound from a small cylinder, I thought
it probable that it might be a little twisted ; in which case it
would, from the weight of the needle, untwist until counter-
balanced by the elasticity of the wire. If, in these circum-
stances, heat were applied, it might happen that the elasticity
of the wire would be altered, and consequently, from that
circumstance alone, that the needle might change its position.
