Trace element signatures in olivine-hosted melt inclusions can further be used to constrain the
dimensions of the magma bodies in which they were formed. If the variability in trace element
ratios and isotopic ratios in the melt inclusions is inherited from mantle-derived heterogeneity
[145,146], then the melt inclusions were trapped during concurrent cooling and mixing [145].

Thermal models for sill cooling, convection and mixing, coupled with thermodynamic models of :B
fractionation, place constraints on sill thickness. It emerges that these magma bodies must be less : =
than 10m thick to produce the observations [12], which involves the production of a 4m thick 2k
layer of mush over a timescale of approximately one month, reviewed by Maclennan [12]. : o

Evidence for antecryst entrainment is not restricted to basaltic volcanic centres, but instead are 3
common features of rhyolites from caldera-forming eruptions in continental settings [147] as well :3
as a range of magma types in arc settings [148,149]. In fact, arc magmatic systems preserve clear : 8
evidence for extensive mixing and mingling in the form of resorption textures, sieved plagioclase, od

antecrystic clots and clusters, mafic enclaves and other signs of disequilibrium [132,133,150-154].
Cashman & Edmonds [139] explore the heterogeneity in major elements of arc melts (glasses)
inherent in magma extracted from different pressures in the arc crust, which record different
liquid lines of descent owing to the influence of H2O on the crystallization path.

The minerals in intermediate arc magmas also record information about magma petrogenesis
that can be used to infer the compositions of melts that existed earlier in the magma’s history.
One example is evidence for ‘cryptic’ crystallization of amphibole at depth that is later ‘erased’
from the system through mixing and fractionation during magma ascent [155]. Humphreys et al.
[138] use amphibole compositions, which hold a large range of trace elements and are stable
