In all these cases the anatomy of the sporophyte will present
points of interest, and especially the arrangement of the vascular system in their
creeping rhizomes. But this I leave over for discussion by others who are already at
work on this special aspect of the question. From the facts before us, I conclude that the suggestion of Prest and of Bommer
is a sound one, viz., that the Loxsomacese should be regarded as a distinct tribe,
having affinities with the Gleichenizecese and Schizseaceze on the one hand, and on the
other with the Hymenophyllacese and Dennsteedtiinse ; the attempt should not be
made to force it into any other tribe of living Ferns. Summary for Loxsoma.

receptacle, upon which the sporangia arise in basipetal succession,
