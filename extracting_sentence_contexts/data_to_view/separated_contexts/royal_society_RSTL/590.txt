When, for instance, the air was at 58?, the interval commenced
at the 108th degree, and ended at the g8th. When the air was
at 642?, it commenced at 1144*, and ended at 1044. That the same instrument, exposed to cool in the air, does in
fact cool the same number of degrees in the same time, very
nearly, when the given interval of the scale of the thermometer

is reckoned from the same height, or given number of degrees
above the temperature of the air at the time when the experi- -
ment is made, will appear from the following results of 11
different experiments, made on different days, and when the air
in which the instrument was axpoare to cool was at different
degrees of temperature. The large cylindrical vessel, No. 1, having its two ends well
covered up with eider-down, furs, &c. its vertical sides being
exposed naked to the air, in a large quiet room, was found to
cool 10 degrees, viz. from the goth to the 4oth degree above
the temperature of the air in which it was exposed, as follows. Temperature Time employed
of the air, - Degrees cooled. in cooling.
