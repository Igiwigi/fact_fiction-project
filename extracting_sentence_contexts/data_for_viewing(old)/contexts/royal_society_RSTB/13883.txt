Let us assume we have a set of populations for which we have statistics involving X, and both admixture sources will be
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequency data non-zero, and, in some cases, F3(Xy; X2, X3) will be negative
from S biallelic loci, and for simplicity, I will assume that (exact conditions can be found in [41]).

there is no missing data. Let xj, denote the frequency of an arbi-
trary allele at the /th SNP in the ith population; and let X;= (xj1,

Xj2, ...Xjs) be a vector collecting all allele frequencies for popu- (b) Geometric interpretation of F-statistics

The three F-statistics are defined as Recently, Oteo-Garcia & Oteo [49] showed that this is not,
s in fact, necessary. Specifically, they interpret the populations

SH space R°. In this case, the F-statistics can be thought of as
13 inner (or dot) products, and they showed that all properties
F3(X1; Xz, X3) = gu — X21) (X11 — X31) (2.1b) and tests related to treeness can be derived in this larger
Il s space. In this framework, the F-statistics can be written as
