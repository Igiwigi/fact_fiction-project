important for understanding traffic dynamics.

Before concluding this section, we collect the characteristic times appearing in
traffic. We would like to emphasize that, even though these are close to each other
in magnitude, their physical meaning and their effects on the dynamics may be

completely different.

— Reaction time. T,0,K*% 0.5-1.5s is a dead time required to process
information about stimuli and to initiate actions. It may be different for
different kinds of stimuli; see model (3.10).

— Relaxation time. T* 1-10s appears owing to the fact that vehicles are
capable of only finite acceleration; see model (3.12).

— Desired time gap (also called time headway). Tsay 1-2s is the time
distance drivers would like to keep when following a leader; see
model (3.13).

We remark that these times should also be distinguished from the numerical
update time that is simply an artefact of time discretization. However, depending
on the discretization scheme, its effects may be similar to those of the multiples of
the reaction time (Kesting & Treiber 2008). In the following sections, all results
are presented on the dynamic car-following model (3.7), (3.10), but most methods
are also applicable to (3.7), (3.8) and (3.1), (3.4).
