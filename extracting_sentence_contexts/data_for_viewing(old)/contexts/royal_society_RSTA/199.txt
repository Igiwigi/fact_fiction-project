difficulties are.

DNA sequences alone are not capable of being parsed as the complete logic of

a program. Whenever we talk of a genetic program we must also include steps
hat involve the rest of the organism (e.g. my discussion of the ‘circadian rhythm’
program in Noble (2006, pp. 69-73), and this is certainly true for the analysis
of cardiac rhythm (Noble 2006, pp. 56-65)). Much of the logic of living systems
ies beyond DNA. To save the program metaphor therefore we would have to say
hat the ‘program’ is distributed between the tape and the machine. This would,
incidentally, explain an important fact. Virtually all attempts at cross-species
cloning fail to develop to the adult (Chung et al. 2009). A possible explanation
is that the egg cell information is too specific (Chen et al. 2006). In fact, in the
only case so far, that of a carp nucleus and goldfish egg, the egg cytoplasm clearly
influences the phenotype (Sun et al. 2005). Strathmann (1993) also refers to the
influence of the egg cytoplasm on gene expression during early development as
one of the impediments to hybridization in an evolutionary context. There is
no good reason why cells themselves should have ceased to evolve once genomes
arose. But if we need a specific (special purpose) ‘computer’ for each ‘program’,
he program concept loses much of its attraction.

The way to save the genetic program idea would therefore be to abandon
he identification of genes with specific sequences of DNA alone and return to
he original idea of genes as the causes of particular phenotypes (Kitcher 1982;
Mayr 1982; Dupré 1993; Pichot 1999; Keller 20006; Noble 2008c) by including
