Sor 153. The only loophole for an explanation may be that the value of v as found by
‘gFasry and Prror comes from the Principal series, and that VP, (1) is not really
B(o). This latter point has been discussed in [I.] and also in [II., p. 38]. It is
dequivalent to a considerable change i inS(). To obtain a value 156 or 52x 8 would
Srequire an increase of ‘07 in », #.e, to 17°25, Such a value would be quite well in
consonance with the measures of SAUNDERS and of K. and R. for other doublets, e.g.,
D(2) 17°30 (S.), S (8) 17°224°26 (K.R.), S(4) 17°05+°38 (K.R.), P(1) 17°20 (K.R.).
But Fasry and Prror’s values for P (1)—independently verified by Lord RayLergo—
would seem conclusive against this value, unless F. and P.’s apply only to VP (1)
and 17°25 to S$(«). This would correspond to a lateral displacement of' 3, (see below)

between VP (1) and S().
S and Se both give 8x 144, which falls in line with the other sub-groups. In fact,

* This is the value first deduced when the international system of atomic weights was used. It is
5; more than that in the table. The question is considered below.

if n denote the order of the group, the sub-groups would be based on (2n+1) 4, and
(2n+2)d,. This would leave 3, and 2d, for group 0, He, as is seen, may be either.

The foregoing evidence is, I think, conclusive that the atomic weight terms are
