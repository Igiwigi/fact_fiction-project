in the lamina which extends
anteriorly for 0-97 mm. and posteriorly for 1-82 mm. Though the posterior relations of the laminae remain the same as in the younger
specimens, there is a striking difference anteriorly where the lower lamina now projects
far in front of that of the upper jaw. This is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor
region of the dental lamina is retained in the lower jaw, it has already disappeared in
the upper jaw (compare W, WW and X in fig. 11). The wax model (which was made ata magnification of 150) (figs. 24-27, Plates 34, 35)
shows well the common labio-dental sheet anteriorly in the lower jaw, and the gradual
separation of the dental lamina from the medial aspect of this sheet as it is traced in a
backward direction. I shall use the terminology adopted by Witson and Hitu (1907) to describe the
teeth developed from the posterior part of the laminae, i.e. the letters “‘v”’, “w”, “x,
“y” and ‘“‘z’’.
