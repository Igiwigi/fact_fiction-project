SEWARD ON THE STRUCTURE

The venation of Matonia pectinata is especially interesting in the comparison of
fossil fronds; the occasional lateral anastomoses, and the close approach to the
Woodwardia type of venation shown in Plate 18, fig. 23, agree exactly with the
Phiebopteris character, while the forked and separate lateral veins are identical with
those usually associated with the fossil fronds referred to Laccopteris (cf. text-
fig. 9, A-C). Before enumerating fossil species of Laccopterzs, a brief reference must be made to
the genus Phlebopteris, which it is now proposed to include under the former designation. BrononiArr instituted the generic name Philebopteris in 1828,* and modified the
diagnosis in 1849.t The anastomosing of the lateral veins in “ arcades” close to
the midrib (fig. 9, B), and the origin of simple or forked veins from the arched
anastomoses are characters on which especial stress is laid; the venation is in fact
precisely that of Matonia pectinata. The occurrence of lateral anastomoses and
arcade-like connections in Matonia, combined with secondary forked veins not laterally
connected, serves to emphasise the probability that the supposed difference in the
venation characters of Laccopteris and Phlebopteris is of little or no value.t

The following list must not be regarded as including all known species of
Laccopteris or Phlebopteris; only some of the more satisfactory examples are
mentioned,§ and in a few cases synonyms are given to illustrate the probable identity
of leaves frequently referred to distinct species :—
