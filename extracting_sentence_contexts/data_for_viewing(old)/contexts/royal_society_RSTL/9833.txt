THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF THIN LIQUID FILMS. 453

the thicknesses corresponding to the colours were not identical with those furnished
by NewroN's scale, eyen when readjusted on account of the omissions already referred
to. Nor was this gurprising. The above description of the method of estimation
is sufficient to show that in all probability no two observers would agree as to
the positions of the boundaries between neighbouring tints. If accuracy is required
each must construct his own scale,

This might be undertaken by observations on a set of NewrTox's rings. Two
difficulties, however, here arise, the firs due to the fact that, even when NewroN's
rings are produced on a large scale, the colours are far more crowded than on the
films, and thus not only is their appearance somewhat changed, but differences of
hue clearly distinguishable in the one case are los in the other. The second
difficulty has its origin in the distortion of the lenses, used in the production of
Newrzox's rings, in the neighbourhood of their point of contact. Calculations based
on the as8umed sphericity of the lenses are thus of little use near the central
black patch. For these reasons it was determined to 8upplement the observations
on NgwrTox's rings by those made on the films, to determine the thicknesses
corresponding to a few clearly marked colours by the first, and the ratios of the
5 thicknesses of the intermediate tints by the second.
Â© As it was necessary to produce the rings on a large scale, a pair of the curved
= plates, 8old for this purpose by Mr. LAapp in a brass case, were placed in a vertical
