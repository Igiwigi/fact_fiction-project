mind or body, act either as stimulant or sedative according to the degree in
which they are applied, the stimulant effect always arising from the less, the
sedative from the greater application of them, and different agents being better
fitted to produce the one or other of these effects.

Thus with respect to the nervous influence, the more powerful, within cer-
tain limits, the action of the agent on the brain and spinal marrow, the greater
is the stimulant effect on both classes of muscles ; but if it be extreme, as when
a seyere blow is inflicted on-the head, instead of exciting, it impairs their power,
in the same way that they are powerfully excited by a moderate application of
electricity, but deprived of all power by its excessive application.

The foregoing observations are strikingly illustrated by the facts which have
been ascertained respecting. the nature of the neryous influence.
As this influence has been found to perform its functions in the animal eco-
nomy after it has been made to pass through a space not less than a quarter of

an inch between the divided ends of a nerve, we must suppose either that, like
magnetism or gravitation, it is capable of extending to a distance from the body
in which it exists, or of passing through other conductors than the neryes.
Were the former opinion correct, the influence of a nerve would extend in all
