The molecular descriptors
which gave a positive correlation to Cp were related to the presence of aromatic and conjugated
carbons suggesting that delocalization of electrons allows the energy deposited from the electron
beam to be shared and dissipated more effectively, so decreasing the formation of damaging
radicals [41-44]. The molecular descriptors that exhibited a negative correlation to Cp were
related to the number of rotatable bonds (which relates to the number of different structural
configurations the molecules can undertake) and, more surprisingly, factors that related to the
numbers of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The latter can be rationalized by the fact that
when hydrogen bonding is present, the adjacent covalent bond is weakened making it more
susceptible to radiolytic damage. An alternative explanation might be that, during radiolysis,
the chemical groups involved in the hydrogen bond may readily form radicals (e.g. OH-) that
can propagate and cause further damage.
