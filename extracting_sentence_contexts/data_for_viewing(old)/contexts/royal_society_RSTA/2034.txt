scales has yet to be undertaken in a systematic way. The present manuscript has
highlighted potential sources of uncertainty, and the next step is to assess their relative
importance quantitatively. This open question will highlight important sources of
uncertainty, and will motivate efforts to reduce them. A particular example would be
the way that credibility of a personalized model is informed by better understanding of
sources in uncertainty in generic tissue models.

â€” Coupling of uncertainties across scales requires tools to couple uncertainties across
scales and types of model [92,116]. This coupling may operate not only from cell to whole
organ, but also in the reverse direction. Co-variances among model parameters, especially
at different scales, are also an important consideration. A recent study has reviewed
sensitivity analysis in many different modelling applications, and has highlighted the
fact that many sensitivity analyses are flawed because model input spaces have not been
explored thoroughly taking into account co-varying inputs [122].


Cardiac electrophysiology models have become a valuable tool not only for basic science, but
also have been proposed for transition into clinical applications [98,99,117,118]. The credibility of
model outputs has therefore become an important challenge. Models are necessarily incomplete
representations of reality, and so uncertainty and sensitivity analysis should focus on quantifying
the extent to which the model outputs are reliable, and the minimization of uncertainty [122]. For
safety-critical applications, these are crucial questions.

The main recommendation from the present analysis is therefore that taking into account
uncertainty and variability should be considered a critical aspect of cardiac electrophysiology
