In the other segments it gives
rise simply to the trunk limb muscles. It is only in the maxillary segment, however,
that a coelomic cavity appears in the ventral as well as in the dorsal mesoderm, and
this cavity develops into the end sac of the maxillary gland and persists throughout life. Although these two cavities are not formed through the division of an originally single
cavity, as is the case in the formation of the dorsal and ventral ccelom of Peripatus,
the fact that the ventral cavity appears later in the segmental mass of mesoderm in
continuity with the dorsal coelom sac of the maxillary segment indicates, probably,

that it is strictly homologous with the ventral ccelom of Peripatus. This is entirely in
agreement with the view that the maxillary gland of Crustacea is the homologue of the
excretory organs of Peripatus. Although this view is adopted here only with
certain reservations, it must be pointed out that, up to now, this interpretation of the
maxillary gland has rested chiefly on adult anatomical comparisons. ‘The development
of the maxillary gland and its relation to the coelom has not before been thoroughly
worked out.
