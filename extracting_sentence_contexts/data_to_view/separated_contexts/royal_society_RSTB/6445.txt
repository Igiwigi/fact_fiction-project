It is usually
of a temporary nature except in Gryllus and the Blattidae where it persists in the
larva (Hrymons, 1895, a), and in the Isoptera where it is present even in the sexually
ripe individuals (HotmGrEN, 1909). It is generally unpaired in origin, but in the
Orthoptera evidence of its paired origin has been produced (Hrymons, 1895, a ;
Wiesmann, 1926 ; Roonwat, present paper). Notwithstanding the fact that the
suboesophageal body shows a strikingly uniform structure and is, in all probability,
homologous in all insects, its origin is remarkably varied. Below are briefly
summarized the various modes of its origin in different insects. They fall into
three main groups, viz. :

(a) Endodermal Origin.
