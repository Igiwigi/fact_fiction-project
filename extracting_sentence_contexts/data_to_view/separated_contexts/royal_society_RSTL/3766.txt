I ſuppoſe the denſity of each particle three times
that of iron®, The number of ſuch ſpherules that
contain as much matter as an iron ball of one yard
diameter, I have found to be 15552 xxxv1<4; con-
-quently 576 £xxv1 ſuch ſpherules' contain as much
matter as an iron ball of 1 foot diameter,

Let ſuch a+ ball be. ſuppoſed to move uniformly
with a velocity that ſhopld carry it 1000 yards in 1”,

The light of the ſun traverſes the ſemidiameter
of the orbis magnus in 5” nearly,

In'the enſuing calculations, T (hall reckon the ſun's
horizontal parallax 9/”, '

According to this hypotheſis, the ſemidiameter of
the orbis magnus will contain 22919 ſemidiameters
of the earth,

figned to it, trayerſes —® of this ſpace, or 54.57 ſe-
