This series exhibits the same phenomenon in a very
ED clonnted manner. For in the bulb spectrum \6678 is reduced to 4, but 4922
only to 4%, while the next member, 14388, is actually enhanced to 14, and the next,
4144, is even further enhanced to 1}. These are the other two lines mentioned
Jready in connection with their enhancement in nebule.
3 An even more striking fact in the same connection occurs with the Sharp series of
eParhelium. Its first visible member appears in our ordinary Helium spectrum, but is
OEE invisible in the wedge photograph from the bulb. This is the line 45047.
