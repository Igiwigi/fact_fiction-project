A similar fonction may possibly be assigned to the receptaculum dorsale
described by ws in Macrones nemnrus. *

No differential action of the tivo sacculi can possibly take place, at all events so fay
as impulses received through the Weberian mechanism are concerned, since the only
channel! through which any movement initiated in the fluids of the atrial cavities by
the motion of the Weberian ossicles can reach them is the median and unpaired sinus
endelymphatieus ; bence it must follow that each succulus will be affected by any
such disturbances to an equal extent and at the same moment,

Tt may be well to emphasize the fact that, whatever may be the force whieh sets
the Weberjan ossicles ti motion, there are no obvious adaptations for increasing its.
intensity in the couree of transmission to the sensory epithelium of the inner ear, and
if, as we believe will prove to be the case, it is the variations in the volume of the gas
contained in the air-bladder under the influence of different hydrostatic pressures,
which condition the lateral expansion or contraction of the anterior chamber, it is
obyious that the foree exerted on the Weberian ossicles will be too considerable for
there to be any use of increased leverage in order to nuginent. the impulse imparted
to the fivids of the internal ear. We shall again refer to this point in discussing
Weesnr's auditory theory of the fiction of these ossicles.
