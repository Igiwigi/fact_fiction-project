By exploiting a fine pulse
control and free evolution with J-coupling, a universal set of quantum logic gates
can be designed. Particularly important are pulse sequences that implement the
QST, for both spin 1/2 and quadrupole nuclei [1]. The two earlier-mentioned facts are the very basis of NMR-QIP, and work
extremely well for two-qubit quantum computers. But as the number of qubits
increases, things rapidly become complicated. One of the main challenges in
current research on NMR-QIP concerns the design of special pulse sequences
and, for that, powerful techniques have been developed: strong modulating pulses
and gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE).
