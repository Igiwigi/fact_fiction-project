hedron, or of dodecahedron, &c. there does not appear a cor-
responding probability that any two dissimilar substances
would assume the same form of a particular rhomboid of 10g?
and a few minutes, to which no such geometric regularity or
peculiar simplicity can be ascribed,

But though so accurate a correspondence, as has been
hitherto supposed to exist in the measures of the three carbo-
nates above-mentioned, might be justly considered as highly
improbable, no degree of improbability whatever attaches to
the supposition, that their angles approach each other by some
difference, s0 small as hitherto to have escaped detection.
And this in fact I find to be the case.

Since the angles observable in fractures of crystalline sub-
stances are subject to vary a little at different surfaces, and
even in different parts of the same surface ( as is evident from
the confused image een by reflection from them ), I shall not
at present undertake to determine the angles of these bodies
to less than five minutes of a degree. This, indeed, is the

8mallest division of the goniometer that I usually employ, as
I purposely decline giving s0 much time to these inquiries, as
would be requisite for attempting to arrive at greater precision.
