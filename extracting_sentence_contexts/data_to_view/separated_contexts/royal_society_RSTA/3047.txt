On the other hand, the three glasses with
a low ©, all contain a comparatively high percentage of K,O. We conclude that
‘either B,O; raises Cy, or K,O lowers it, or both. Also, looking at 2783, which is the
Pwest of the seven, we notice that it contains the least percentage of B,O;, but not
fhe highest percentage of K,O. This suggests that B,O, is more efficient in raising
&, than K,O in lowering it. That the effect of B,O; must be predominant is other-
Wise evident from the fact that the order of the percentages of B,O, is the same as
fhe order of magnitude of C,, with one exception (1809). § The last column of Table VI. shows the values of (percentage of B,O;)—3 (percentage

@ K,O).
