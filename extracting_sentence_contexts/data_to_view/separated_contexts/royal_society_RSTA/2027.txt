INTRODUCTION. Tn an earlier paper on the subject of pleochroic haloes* it was pointed out that
several features of the halo derived from the uranium family of radioactive elements
were not easily accounted for. This fact led me to undertake a more careful study of
haloes. But, although many observations and measurements were made, until recently
my attempts at obtaining solution of the difficulties were too crude to merit
publication. They were more especially hampered by the scarcity of haloes derived
from the thorium family of elements.
