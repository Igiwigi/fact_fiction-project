that their refractive index differs from that of the medium in which they are
embedded, it is possible “ to combine a specular and highly coloured reflection with a
very imperfectly developed polarisation, and thus to evade the difficulty which meets
us, when we confine ourselves to ‘ thin plates.’”

Both the opinion and experiments of MaLtock* strongly support the interference
theory. He points out the fact that the polarisation phenomena (ellipticity, ete.,
observed by Micetson) “ may, though functions of the wave length, accompany
the production of colour without being necessary to it, that is, may depend on the
molecular while the colour depends on the mechanical structure.” Moreover,
Mattock is strongly of the opinion that the disappearance of nearly all colour,
when the scales are immersed in highly refractive fluids, is very much in favour of
interference being the source of the phenomena, Even stronger evidence is afforded
by the behaviour of scales under pressure. He arranged a simple piece of apparatus,
by which scales could be brought into the centre of a series of NewTon’s rings,
formed between a piece of plate-glass and a lens of suitable curvature. He could
thus observe through the microscope the effect of applying ‘pressure to any object.
In the case of scales,t the colour was always destroyed, but, when feathers were
used, it tended to return when the pressure was removed. He was strongly of the
