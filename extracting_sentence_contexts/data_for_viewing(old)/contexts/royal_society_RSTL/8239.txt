BEARING OF THE NEW OBSERVATIONS.

The experiments I have lately made, taken in conjunction with my determination of
the long and short lines of metallic vapours, and the consequent simplification of the
spectra by the reduction of pressure or molecular distance, set this question at rest, and
in the direction indicated by MITSCHERLICH, CLIPTON, Roscom, and DIAcoN ; while much
light has been thrown upon all the prior observations, as a consequence of which they are
brought much more into harmony than at first appeared.

First. T have observedF that whether the spectra of iodides, bromides, &c. be observed
in the flame or weak spark, in air, the spectrum is in the main the same, as maintained
by Kircnnoey and BUNSEN ; but that this is not the spectrum of the metal is establisghed
by the facts, that with Â« low temperature only the longest lines of the metals are present,
showing that only a small quantity of the simple metal is present as a result of partial
dissociation, and that by increasing the temperature, and consequently the amount of
dissociation, the other lines of the metals appear in the order of their length with each
rise of temperature.

Secondly. T have convinced myself that this is the spectrum of the oxide, because in
air, after the first application of heat, the spectra and metallic lines are in the main the
