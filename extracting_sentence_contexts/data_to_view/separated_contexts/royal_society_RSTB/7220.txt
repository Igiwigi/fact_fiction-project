(129) The effect of intensity of illumination

As soon as stimulation of the retina began, with the apparatus described above, it was
found that not only did the precision of focusing play an important part in determining the
apparent size of the image, but also the intensity of illumination. In fact the sharpest image
was obtained if both focus and intensity were adjusted at the same time. The following
observations were made with the fixation lamp at its brightest, its image being examined
critically with the reducing apparatus. With a lens of 1D before the observerâ€™s eye, the
image of the fixation source as seen in the apparatus appeared to consist of a disk of finite
size with a bright sharp edge.
