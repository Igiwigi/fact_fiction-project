that by the s8vlar warmth upward currents of warm and downward currents of cold air (similar to those of
HrawoLvr on the plain of Antures) are established, and that snch days are also unfayourable to the transmission
of 8ound. In another passage, however, he seems to indorse the prevalent notion that the optical transparency
of the air and its power to transmit sound go hand in hand; whereas in our experiments days of the highest
optical transparency proved themselves acoustically most opaque.

But nothing of this description that T have read equals in point of interest the following account of tho battle
of Gain's Farm, for which I am indebted to the Rector of the University of Virginia.

« Lynchburgh, Virginia,
March 19th, 1874.
*S$1n,—T have jus read with great interest your lecture of January 16th, copied by Lrrrzr's © Living Age”
from * Nature, on the acoustic transpareney and opacity of the atmosphere. The remarkable facts you mention
induce me to stato to you a fact which T have occasionally mentioned, but always where I am not well known,
with the apprehension thai my yeracity would be questioned, Tt made a strong impression on me at the time,
but was an insoluble mystery until your discourse gave a possible golution.

« On'the afternoon of June 28th, 1862, I rode in company with General G. W. Raxvoren, then Secretary of
War of the Confederato States, to Prrcn's house, about nine miles from Richmond ; the evening before
General Ls had begun his attack on M*CrarLAxy's army, by crossing the Chickahominy about four miles above
Prror's, and driving in the right wing of MOLecLaxy's army, The battle of Gain's Farm was fought tho after-
noon to which T refer. The valley of the Chickahominy is about one and a half mile wide from hill top to
