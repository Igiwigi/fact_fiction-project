The rapid arrival of the E.M.F. of the excitatory variation at its maximum is
2 remarkable, and, as far as my own experience goes, considerably more marked than
G in the case of the Frog’s skin diréctly excited. ‘The slowness, however, of the subse-
$ quent decline agrees closely with the phenomena of the variation of the Frog’s skin,
as already noted by Hermann and Bayiiss and Braprorp. In the case of the sub-
@ maxillary gland, Bayniss and Braprorp mention the occurrence of a quick maximum
“2 and slow decline of potential as a result of chorda stimulation.
€ As regards the length of the latent period, I have as yet been unable to make any
g exact measurements ; all that can be here stated is that it is shortened by increasing
3 the strength of the stimulus—a fact already noticed by ENGELMANN in the case of the
skin of the Frog.
8 The relation, too, between the magnitude of the variation and the strength of the
stimulus evident in Experiment F. (where the break shock gave a deflection of 230°
and the make only 45° with coil at 5 centims., while at 10 the make shock was
ineffectual), has been observed by both Rorser and ENGELMANN in the case of the
Frog’s skin, the former using indirect stimulation by means of the cutaneous nerves,
the latter stimulating directly through the leading-off electrodes.



352 PROFESSOR E. W. REID ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE

STIMULATION BY FARADISATION,

The excitatory effect following faradisation of the skin is, as would be expected,
far more marked than that produced by the application of a single induction shock,
The increase of E.M.F. upon stimulation, as measured by the method I have used,
is, of course, no criterion of that actually developed in the skin, on account of the
short circuiting that occurs in the skin structures themselves, but the percentage
value in terms of that of the current of rest is of interest. ’
Some observations of the increase of the E.M.F. upon faradic stimulation of the
skin of the Eel will be found in Table I.
