Nore 4, Ars. 41 Axnb 104. The assumption that the coefficients A, m, X,, and Ng, also m' and Ng, equation (99), are the same for
8tucco as for meerschaum is equivalent to assuming that the only respect in which the interstices of these
plates differ is that of conrseness. There is no « priori ground for making this asxumption, The fact that the
logarithmic homologues for stuceo fit those for meerschaum through snch a considerable range of densities
proves the approximate trnth of the assumption ; but ib is possible, since c and c,, are arbitrary dimensions,
that the curves for transpiration under pressure depending on A, 14, Ny, and N may approximately fit for
one value of ©, and the curves for thermal transpiration depending on Az, m, AM, Ay in, and XN, may

approximately fit for another yalue of —. Tf this were 0 log. (= :); the shift necessary to bring the onrves

into coincidence would not be the same for transpiration under pressnre as for thermal transpiration, and
as has been pointed ont (Art. 41), this is to a certain extent the case, this ratio having the yalues 6:5 and 5:6—
a diſference which was sufficiently decided to call for notice, but which is no 80 large but that, as pointed
out (Art. 41), it may possibly be due to the plates being hot in the one case and cold in the other. In
any case the smallness of the difference is an additional proof that the interstices do not greatly differ as
pass8ages in any respect except that of size.
