and similar to that of the early stages of pregnancy, but the regressing mammary
gland does not react perceptibly The average number of corpora lutea in an ovary,
4-75, is approximately the same as during the breeding season. Tables III-V show the remarkable fact that 93 out of 99 adult female stoats
distributed throughout the year (whose ovaries were sectioned), had one set of corpora
lutea and the exceptions were lactating, oestrus or pro-oestrus animals. In the
whole series, however, only one non-pregnant stoat killed on March 8 had corpora
lutea transitional to those of pregnancy ; in the remainder the corpora lutea were
quite distinct. Since those of one cycle tend to disappear before the follicles have
ripened for the next oestrus, it is impossible to determine accurately the number or
length of the post-pregnancy cycles in the stoat.
