Instead of this, the slide was taken to a place where it could be
illuminated by strong daylight, and the exposure given to the sensitive photographic
plate was of course correspondingly increased. Zine templates of the shapes required
were made, and by placing the template on the wax, the outline was cut with a
sharp knife, and the particular well thus formed. In cases where the flow in the
well was very slow, air bubbles became imprisoned, and could only be removed after
great difficulty ; in fact, in one or two cases—as will be seen in the photographs, figs,
31 and 32 (Plate 19)—they could not be removed at all. Secrron IT.

(a) In order to test the applicability of the stream-line method to the solution of
two-dimensional magnetic problems, it was decided to work out mathematically
the case of an infinite cylinder of elliptic section placed in an originally uniform
magnetic field with its major axis along the field, to plot the lines of magnetic
induction corresponding to a permeability of 100, and to compare the diagram
so obtained with a stream-line diagram. The theoretical diagram is given in fig. 9
(Plate 14) and the corresponding stream-line diagram in fig. 10.
