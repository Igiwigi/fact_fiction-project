To this species CREDNER (13) in 1893 referred some imperfect skulls, a shoulder
girdle, femur and hind foot from Niederhasslich, The hind foot is that of a
Pelycosaur, and need not be further considered here. Of the other remains all,
except the original of Plate XXX, fig. 2, seem to be specifically identical, the skull
mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown to enter into the orbital
margin. These animals certainly do not belong to Sclerocephalus. The type skull of that
genus has the orbits in the middle of its length.
