into the protoplasm of the oosphere. The passage takes place through a well-
marked pit in the wall of the tube, as has been described above. GoroscHANKIN j

(15) in Pinus Pumilio observed that both the generative nuclei passed into the
oosphere ; STRASBURGER (8) established the same fact in Picea vulgaris. Drxon (14)
was the first to observe that in Pinus silvestris all the four nuclei from the pollen
tube (i.e, the two generative nuclei, the pollen tube nucleus and the stalk cell
nucleus) pass into the oosphere, though he was unable clearly to distinguish them
one from the other as they lay embedded in the protoplasm of the oosphere.*

In a well-fixed and stained preparation all the four nuclei, together with a con-
siderable number of starch grains from the pollen tube, can be clearly observed lying
in the upper part of the oosphere. It cannot be doubted that cytoplasm also
passes over into the oosphere, for each generative nucleus in the pollen tube is

clearly surrounded by its own layer of cytoplasm, as can be observed in the stage

when the tube is already in contact with the oosphere.
