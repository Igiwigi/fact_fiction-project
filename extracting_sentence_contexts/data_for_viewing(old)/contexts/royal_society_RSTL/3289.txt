This point must be between forty and fifty feet above the level of the sea. There are
remnants, as before stated, in this part of the Great Glen, as well as at the south-west
extremity, of coarse sublittoral formations, which, I suppose scarcely any one would
dispute, were accumulated before that small change of level took place, which is indi-
cated by the eleyated marine remains. That the movement must have been exceedingly

its formation, which rise one above another on both coasts of Scotland. Mr. Mar-
