but not surprisingly, the latter has not been shown to elevate
self-grooming rates [55].

To the best of our knowledge, only one other study
experimentally determined allogrooming rates from fungus-
exposed individuals towards their nest-mates, although this
route is also important for spread of the pathogen in the
colony. Similar to our study, Bos et al. [24] reported a
reduction—in their study non-significant—of allogrooming
by infectious individuals to their nest-mates, suggesting
‘self-removal’ of the infectious individual [24,25,56] (but see
[57] for disease-independent self-removal). Moreover, the
fact that nest-mates did not change their mutual allogroom-
ing rates in our experiment indicates that there is no
upregulation of allogrooming among untreated colony mem-
bers when co-inhabiting the nest with an exposed individual.
Yet, previous contact with infectious individuals has been
reported to increase allogrooming responses towards incoming
nest-mates, independent of their health status [38,48].

(b) Infection and healing probabilities

We employ the stochastic small-scale model to determine the
ratio of the infection and healing probability by social immu-
nity a/B,, for the studied Lasius—Metarhizium system based
