where A was the contact area. Equation (1.1) fitted the experimental results reasonably well.
Equation (1.2) did not.

Strength cannot be found in equation (1.1) because the force is proportional to diameter, not
area. Also, elastic modulus is absent so Kj- is not involved. If strength does not exist as a material
constant for brittle tests, then the extraordinary powerful adhesion of nanoparticles in figure 1
might be explained. A test on contacting spheres made from solidified gelatin spheres showed
that the strength did rise as the diameter was reduced, almost fitting equation 1, as shown in
figure 3. The papers in this volume lead us along this new path, which is described more fully in
the recent book Crack Control [4], showing that brittle strength increases as test samples are made
smaller, a fact that has not yet been fully reconciled in Fracture Mechanics textbooks.

The Royal Society has a strong track record in the study of fine cracks, dating back to Hooke’s
magnificent observations in Micrographia [5] and Newton’s celebrated black spot in the ring
interference pattern between contacting telescope lenses where ‘two polish’d marbles,... by
immediate contact stick together’ to give cracking noises [6,7]. The best Royal Society papers
appear in three forms: (i) experimental investigations like the study of rivetted joint strength for
iron railway bridges by Fairbairn in 1850 [8]; (ii) theoretical contributions like the Eshelby paper
on stress analysis of nano-defects [9]; and (iii) the combination of mathematics and experiment
illustrated by the JKR contribution celebrated here [1]. Eshelby’s paper is the most cited in the
Royal Society Proceedings A, while both Fairbairn and Johnson received the Royal Medal of
the Society, indicating the perceived social value of crack-engineering that avoids death due to
structural collapse. The moral is that theory must go with experiment, as demonstrated in the
