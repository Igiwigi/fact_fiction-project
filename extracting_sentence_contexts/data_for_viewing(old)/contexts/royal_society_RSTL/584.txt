in lavas and in rocks of trap formation, they are utterly inade- |

prisms : they ' offer no means of accounting for the extreme

regularity of the sides and the precision of the angles, for the
articulations, for the close contact in which the perfect columns

are placed to one another, nor for their mutual adhesion, which

is 80 strong, that it often requires considerable violence to se-

parate them. These facts are in: absolute contradiction to all

idea of retreat or contraction, and seem to me to coincide per-

fectly with the explanation of their origin which I have already

presumed to lay before you.

I have the honour to be, &c.
