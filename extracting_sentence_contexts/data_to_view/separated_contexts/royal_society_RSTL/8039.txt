9) the harmonic invariant of the qua-
Arics or conics whose equations are connected by it. 67. It is evident from the last article that, being given four plane conics on a quadric,
the condition that the four conics should be tangential to a fifth is the determinant

and in fact Dr. Sa1Mox's direct proof of this theorem in case of conics on a plane will
apply verbatim to the more general case here considered (sce SALMON'S * Conics,‚Äù 5th
edition, page 366). Cor. From the equation (71) we can find, as Dr. SALMoN has done for conies on a plane,

the equations of the pairs of conics which touch three conics on a quadric; the equa-
tion is
