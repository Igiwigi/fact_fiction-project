This not only prevents a free extension
of the forebrain in frontal direction but it also lifts up the brain, thus influencing the
angle of the brain-axis to the foramen magnum (cf. Kienzt, 1918). The other factor,
a general one, is the large quantity of the brain, together with the fact that the chondro-
cranium ossifies in a very early embryonic period and that the skull, especially the
neurocranium synostoses early, the sutures having disappeared in nearly all birds in a
few months (KrumBAcH, 1927). While the adult brain weight (of the chick) is acquired
after 5 months, the brain increase between the 2nd and 5th months is still about half the
brain weight of the 2 months chicken (Latimer, 1925). Besides, the indice de valeur
cérébralet in the newborn chicken is only 0-68 of the adult.
