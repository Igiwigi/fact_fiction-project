Figure 6. PIMC results for the SSF of the UEG with N = 34 at © = 1 for r, = 4 (green squares) and r, = 20 (red circles). The
dashed curves show corresponding results within the RPA, and the dotted line depicts the SSF of the ideal Fermi gas, which is
independent of r,.

the DSF substantially differs from the plasmon shape with respect to both its peak position and
the peak shape. In this regime, the RPA becomes increasingly inaccurate, and the dotted red curve
noticeably deviates from the solid green PIMC results. With increasing q, the systematic error of
the RPA becomes more pronounced and attains a maximum around intermediate wavenumbers,
q~ 1.5qp. In the single-particle limit of q >> qr, the RPA becomes exact again, and no systematic
deviations are visible for q = 4.39qp and q = 6.27qp (figure 5e,f). Interestingly, the main source of
error in the RPA at intermediate wavenumbers seems to be a constant shift in F(q, t) that does not
depend on the imaginary time. In fact, it is easy to see that the first derivative of F(q,t) around
the origin is exactly reproduced by the RPA, since it fulfils the f-sum rule; cf. equations (2.17)
and (2.18). From equation (2.22), it is then clear that the bulk of the RPA error should already
be present in the SSF S(q), which is shown in figure 6. The green squares show our exact PIMC
results for r; = 4, and the green dashed line represents the corresponding RPA. Evidently, the RPA
underestimates the true magnitude of S(q) for intermediate q, which explains the observed trends
in figure 5.

The dashed blue curves in figure 5 were computed from a simple quasi-particle ansatz. In this
model, it is assumed that the DSF consists of a single delta-like peak around the quasi-particle
excitation energy wap,

Ssp(q,@) = A{5(o — wap) + & PP? 5(w + wQr)}, (3.1)
