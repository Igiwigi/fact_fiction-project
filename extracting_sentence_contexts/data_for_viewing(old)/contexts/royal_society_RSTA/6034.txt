When clearly defined and put to rigorous empirical test, social norms represent a reliable and
accessible mechanism to create large-scale changes in expectations and behaviour [2,14,72]. It
is, however, too simplistic to present social norms uniquely as a solution [25]. While they may
promote massive transformation of behaviour, under some conditions, they can also be an
obstacle to change.

Often the behaviours that contribute to the socially undesirable practice to be changed are
themselves the norm. Think for example of activities that contribute to global warming, such as
eating meat, using air conditioning, not adopting renewable energy solutions, flying or driving
alone: these activities remain the social norm in our societies [23]. Social norms can make any


type of behaviour stable; they can be contrary to the collectively optimal outcome, and in fact
reinforce suboptimal behaviour. Examples are norms that promote blood feuds [73], hate speech
[74], compliance with protection rackets [75], corruption [76] or female genital mutilation [45].

How can we promote positive change when social norms are contrary to and, in fact, reinforce
unsustainable behaviour? Public service announcements and educational efforts that rely on
normative messages to alleviate problematic conduct can be undermined by the perception that
the behaviour to be changed is common (i.e. by empirical expectations that suggest otherwise). An
answer to this question will require studying norms that sustain socially undesirable behaviour
(e.g. [77,78]), and particularly how to change them, e.g. through the framework of trending norm
interventions [79]. An understanding of the emergence, stabilization and change of bad norms
facilitates the development of targeted and effective interventions.
