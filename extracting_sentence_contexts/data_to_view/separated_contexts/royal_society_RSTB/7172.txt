earlier than those of the spermathecae, a fact confirmed by the very young female larva
possessing the rudiments of the caecus on the ninth sternite and lacking any sign of
spermathecal rudiments on the eighth sternite. The two separate buds of the caecus unite in the middle line forming one cavity with
a vertical division. In more advanced larvae all signs of double construction disappear,
except near the opening of the invagination, which still shows a division in its cavity.
