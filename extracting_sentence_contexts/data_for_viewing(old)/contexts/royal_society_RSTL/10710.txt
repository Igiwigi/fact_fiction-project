[Note added Sept. 18, 1886.—T have since discovered the cause of this rise and
fall: it is due to the fact that it is impossible to ensure that the axis of rotation
always passes exactly through the centre of mass. Of course, if the wire were
perfectly flexible, and we could entirely avoid pendulous vibrations when we started

the torsional vibrations, this would not be the case ; but, as a matter of fact, even if
we could start the wire without any pendulous motion, the axis of the wire never
exactly passes through the centre of mass, and, as a consequence, when the wire
vibrates torsionally, s0-called © centrifugal force ” canses torsional motion to be
partially converted into pendulous motion, or vice vers.

When, as in Experiment I., the period of pendulous vibration does not approxi-
mately synchronise with the period of torsional vibration, the phenomenon is not very
pronounced; but when, as in Experiment II., the two periods approach to synchronism,
it is very apparent. Indeed, when the two periods approach sufficiently to synchro-
nism, and the damping is not great, the phenomenon may become 80 marked that,
after a time, almost the whole of the torsional motion becomes converted into
pendulous motion, and presently reconverted again, s0 that the torsional vibrations,
