And as their outline does
not differ in any marked degree from that of all other valleys, this conclusion may
be extended to other cases. . In Glen Roy, where the three shelyes can be seen near each other, little or no dif-
ference can be perceived in their state of preseryation ; indeed the upper one, I think,
is more perfect than the one below it. From this fact an argument has been ad-
vanced by Dr. MaceuLLocn, that no long interval of time could have elapsed between
their formation. But this view is quite inadmissible; either the worn and deeply
notched rock of the shelves on Tombhran, or the buttresses on the middle shelf (as
at the head of Lower Glen Roy), which are composed of large masses of well-rounded
shingle, is sufficient, without considering the intermediate shelf and other appearances,
to prove that the water must haye remained at levels intermediate between the highest
and the 972-feet shelf for very long periods.
