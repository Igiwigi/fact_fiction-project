Instead of making
the assumption, some would say distinctly metaphysical in flavour, that a random variable has a
definite value even if unmeasured, one can state as a fact, with no assumptions involved, that one
can impose a joint distribution on (construct a coupling of) all random variables in the system. And then one can ask whether among all such couplings one can find an identically connected


one. Counterfactual statements can be rigorously formalized, but most would agree that their
logical status is more involved than that of factual statements. ‘The system has a coupling with
properties X’ is more ‘ordinary’ a statement than ‘Had we measured A in another context its value
would have been x’. As stated in a Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article [38], ‘Philosophers,
linguists and psychologists remain fiercely divided on how to best understand counterfactuals’. It is hard to be divided over the notion of a coupling.
