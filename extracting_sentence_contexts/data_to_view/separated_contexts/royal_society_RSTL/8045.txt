Hence the Cartesian cyclide is generated as the locus of the curye of intersection of the

From this it follows that a Cartesian cyclide is a surface of reyolutionâ€”a fact which

we kney otherwise, it being" the surface generated by the revolution of a Cartesian
oyal about the axis passing through the three collinear single foci.
