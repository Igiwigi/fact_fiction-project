GOMPERTZ ON THE SCIENCE

order of survivorship ; problems previously considered many years before, and presented
by my late friend WiLL1Ax Mor6ax, Esq., of the Equitable Society, to the Royal Society,
and published in their valuable Transactions; and which had been since considered,
in a learned work on Lite Annuities, by my late respected friend Josnva Mitxe, Esq.,
with some ingenious notation with respect to: those- contingencies. But. still, the
solutions given to many of the problems, though there were but three lives con-
cerned, were of such an intricate practical form, as to be in my opinion perfectly
useless ; especially on considering that it was necessary to, obtain, by Tables of single
and joint lives, by necessary interpolations, the required data; as the differences to
be used for the interpolations, in consequence of the great irregularity of the numbers
of those Tables, are 80 irregular as to throw great doubt on the necessary accuracy
of the results. And I think the examples I gave of my method could leave no doubt
as to the comparative simplicity which resulted from it, and consequently comparative
utility of my analysis; an analysis which applies where there are more than three lives
concerned, and, in fact, where there are any number of lives to be considered. And
I may refer the reader to my solutions in that tract, to enable him to make the com-
parison. There were various other subjects in that paper, and one I mention in particular,
which is the problem to determine what would be the law of mortality between two
lives A, B, 0 that, 8hould it be known that they are both extinct, it would be an equal
chance which of them had died first; because that asmumption is made, in some of the
solutions above alluded to, by former writers, and for a short period would, in fact,
be approximatively true; and the solution of the problem showed that it could only be
accurately true where there was for each life a uniform equal decrement, though not
necessarily the same for both, or else a decrement for each life proceeding in geome-
trical proportion; the former law being in fact only an extreme case of the latter law.
1 may mention that there are s0me omissions in the printed s8olution of this problem,
which may lead the reader, if he does not enter properly into the analysis, to think it
faulty ; and that the paper on the whole stands in need of some errors in the printing of
it, and in one or two places of an incorrect portion of the manuscript sent to the printer,
being pointed out,
