No special symmetry properties are associated with ‘. It is expanded in terms of
the complete set of eigenfunctions y,,,(r,) of the hydrogen atom; thus

¥(t,,02) = 2 ¥m(F2) F,,(T,)5 (11)

the summation sign including integration over the continuum. By substituting in (7) and
making use of the fact that y,, satisfies the equation

[¥8+2(En+;)| Yu (ts) = 0, (12)

by then multiplying by y* (r,) and integrating over the spatial co-ordinates of the atomic
electron it can be shown that

owing to the orthogonality of , and y,,. To simplify this infinite set of coupled differential equations Born assumes:

(i) that V,,(r,) (which is the electrostatic potential appearing on the left-hand side of
(14)) can be neglected;

(ii) that V,,,(r,) ¥,,(r,) (on the right-hand side of (14)) can be neglected for m+ (so that
the coupling terms disappear) ;

(iii) that F,(r,) (again on the right-hand side of (14)) can be replaced by exp (k,n, 1),
n, being a unit vector in the direction of the incident wave (that is, that /,(r,) is undis-
torted by the interaction—as follows from (i) and (ii)). These assumptions are, of course, equivalent to representing ‘in (13) by

i exp (tk,M, T)) ¥,(To), (17)
