the surface exposed amounted to several hundred feet; and I may add, that I have not
omitted a single observation made by me from the discussion contained in the following
Tables.

Before proceeding to the discussion of the obsevvations, I shall give my reasons for
considering the planes of the flaggy structure observed by me, to be perpendicular to
the lines of maximum force. I had already found in the distorted fossils of West Water-
ford conclusive arguments in favour of the view put forward by Mr. SHARPE, that the
planes of cleavage were perpendicular to the line of maximum force ; and before con-

xcluding that the platy or flaggy structure of the conglomerate was true cleavage, I was
Shound to show that its planes were perpendicular to the lines of greatest force. In the
[Mcence of fossils this could not be proved in the usual manner ; but the following facts.
Sascertained by me, leave little doubt upon this important point.

Soon after I had first observed the flaggy structure of the cleavage planes of the con-
Oglomerate, I found that this structure was confined to planes having the general direc-
Stion of the system (A), already noticed in speaking of faults, although it was occa-
Sionally observed in planes parallel to the system (A'). I never observed the flaggy
Sstructure in the systems C or C'; now, as the line of greatest force in a system of
Belevated beds must lie in the vertical plane, or nearly 80, which contains the direction
of the dip of the beds, and as the strike of the beds is intermediate between the systems
ZAand A', it is evident that we have a close approximation to SHARPE's law ; and, on the
Z hypothesis already advanced, of two systems of elevating forces, perpendicular to A and
SA respectively, we have an exact conformity to this law.
