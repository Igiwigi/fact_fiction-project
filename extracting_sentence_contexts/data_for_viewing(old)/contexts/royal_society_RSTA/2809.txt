time (e.g. [129]).

However, mobile lid convection produced with grain damage does not follow these classic
scaling laws (figure 9), because (1) the relative strength of lithospheric shear zones compared
to the underlying mantle increases with interior mantle temperature (figure 8a) and (2) the
wavelength of convection shows clear changes with increasing temperature, and hence Raj, an
effect which is known to cause deviations from the classic convection scaling laws [130]. As
a result, surface velocities at high temperatures (e.g. above T; = 1) are slower than would be
expected if convection followed the classic convection scaling law. Thus, mobile lid convection, if
it were active on the early Earth, need not result in rapid plate speeds and high surface heat fluxes,
and instead may lie a sluggish lid regime as in the convection models shown in this paper. The
style of lithospheric mobility is important for interpreting a range of geological and geochemical
observations of early Earth evolution, as discussed in more detail in ยง4b. In fact, early Earth plate
velocities could even be lower than present-day plate speeds, while still in a mobile lid regime.
Higher mantle temperatures also enhance the effective grain growth rate in the lithosphere, an
effect not captured in the convection models presented here, which would cause plate speeds
to actually decrease with increasing mantle temperature as a result of strengthening lithospheric
shear zones [104]. A similar result has also been proposed on the basis of dehydration stiffening
of the mantle lithosphere during ridge melting [69].

4. Discussion

A major implication of the results of this study is that mantle thermal state is overall less
important for whether a planet shows mobile lid or stagnant lid tectonics than many previous
studies have indicated. Instead, surface temperature and planet size may have a much stronger
