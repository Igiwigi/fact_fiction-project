by experimentalists that, to provide convincing evidence for spin-triplet supercurrents, one
would have to systematically measure the dependence of I, on the length or thickness of
the ferromagnetic material, to distinguish the rapidly decaying spin-singlet supercurrent from
the long-range spin-triplet supercurrent. The question that remained unanswered, however,
was how to produce such spin-triplet supercurrents efficiently and reliably? In one of their :
early papers, Bergeret and co-workers had suggested making Josephson junctions of the form =
F’/S/F/S/F", where the adjacent pairs of ferromagnetic layers—F’ and F, and F and F’—have : 5
non-collinear magnetizations, in order to produce spin-triplet correlations in the corresponding fa
sandwiched S layers [27]. One difficulty with this proposal is that the S layers must have :
thicknesses ds comparable to the superconducting coherence length 5 =(D/A)'/?, where A Ss
is the superconducting gap in S. If dg <&s, then superconductivity is completely suppressed Dw
in S, whereas if ds >> &s, then the Cooper pairs in S hardly note the relative orientation of the 1m
magnetizations of the F layers on either side of S. In fact, there have been many experiments on 13
trilayer samples of the form F’/S/F in which T; of the trilayer varies with the relative orientation iS
of the magnetizations of F’ and F (some of these will be mentioned later in this article), so the .
experimental difficulty of finding a suitable value of dg is not insurmountable. A second objection
to the F’'/S/F/S/F’ geometry is that it is difficult in a sandwich-style structure to attach leads to
the two buried S layers. For whatever reasons, no successful experiments measuring supercurrent
have been performed with samples of this geometry.

In 2007, Houzet & Buzdin [30] suggested an alternative Josephson junction geometry of
the form S/F’/F/F’/S. This geometry has two immediate advantages over the F’/S/F/S/F”
geometry. First, there is no limit on the thickness of the S electrodes, and second, because those
electrodes are on the outside of the structure, they are easy to contact. It is not clear how
much immediate impact the proposal by Houzet & Buzdin had on the experimental community.
