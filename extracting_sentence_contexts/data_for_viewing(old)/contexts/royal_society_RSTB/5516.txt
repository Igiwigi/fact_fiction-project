place at the time of the primary development of the branch-system. The knowledge
of these branched specimens is another step towards understanding the morphology of
the axes with the axillary structures but does not fully elucidate them.

158 W. H. LANG AND I. C. COOKSON: SOME FOSSIL PLANTS OF

The information obtained as to a particular type of vascular strand and tracheidal
structure extends, but does not fundamentally affect, our previous knowledge. The
same may be said as to the specimens of Sporogonites Chapmani, although the discovery
of further specimens of this general type in a new and distant locality is itself a fact
of great interest. On the other hand, the discovery of a new species of Zosterophyllum,
as determined by the fructification, is not only of interest for the same reason, but
because it has led to a completion and deepening of our conception of the morphology
of this type. Not only do the specimens of Zosterophyllum australianum enable us to
picture this fructification in the solid, but they have led to a fuller understanding of
the corresponding region of Zosterophyllum myretonianum. In both we have clear
proof, by the discovery of spores that the shortly stalked, tangentially extended
appendages were sporangia of large size. These sporangia dehisced by a split extending
along the tangentially extended summit. In this character they resembled the much
smaller sporangia of some species of Lycopodium. But in Zosterophyllum, the stalked
sporangia formed a close or lax spike and no sporophylls or leaves were present.
