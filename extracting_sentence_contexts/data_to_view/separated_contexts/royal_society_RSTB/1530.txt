Darton (No. 5) describes the normal human corpus luteum as filled with
blood soon after rupture has taken place, and he thinks that when no blood clot is
present it is probably due to abnormal menstrual conditions. These views seem to be adopted by a considerable proportion of the medical
profession, although some take the opposite view and, like Cosrr, consider the
presence of a blood clot in the follicle to be an abnormal condition. J have no experience myself of the subject, but it would seem to be undoubtedly
the fact that, in the human female, discharged follicles sometimes have a blood clot
within them and sometimes there is no blood clot present. If the presence of a
blood clot in the discharged follicle of the human female is a normal condition, then
the discharged follicles of M. rhesus described above, differ in a marked manner from
them, and yet they are both menstruating animals. With regard to M. rhesus it may be suggested, in the case of the follicle drawn in
fig. 8, that it was ruptured when menstruation was not going on, and that as the
vessels of the ovary were not congested to the same extent as they would be
during the menstrual period, the absence of a blood clot in this follicle may readily
be accounted for.
