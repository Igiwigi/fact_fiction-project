Kossel (1884) that two types of basic proteins, protamins and histones, are components
of the nuclei of certain animal cells. In his last review of the subject, Kossel (1928)
expressed the opinion that these basic proteins do not occur in all cell nuclei, ‘but only
in the nuclei of certain kinds of tissue’. What limitations in their distribution Kossel had
in mind is not disclosed, but it must be presumed from other of his statements that he

believed that they were present only in fish sperm heads and in the nuclei of avian
erythrocytes and of thymocytes, for it was, in fact, only in these nuclei, or in the tissues
containing them, that they had been found. It has now become recognized as a result
of the present authors’ work in Britain and of that of Mirsky and his collaborators in
America that these basic proteins are much more widespread in their occurrence. They
have been extracted as sulphates from nuclei (Stedman 1944) isolated from various
tissues, including tumours, and in the form of nucleoproteins (Mirsky & Pollister 1942,
1943), or as components of thread-like structures which have been termed ‘chromosomes’
(Mirsky & Ris 1948), obtained directly from a number of tissues. While this work has
not embraced every known type of cell, there can be little doubt that basic proteins are
components of all cell nuclei in the higher animals.

During the course of this work, it was observed (Stedman & Stedman 1944) that the
nuclei of the liver cells and erythrocytes of the salmon differed from the sperm heads of
