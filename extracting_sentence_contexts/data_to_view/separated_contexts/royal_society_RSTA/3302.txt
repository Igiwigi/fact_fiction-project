Ignoring the effects of the Earth’s rotation (letting 2 — 0), we recover the standard

expression for the deep-water gravity water wave (and Gerstner wave) dispersion relation, :23
namely c= ,/g/k. Surface waves with wavelengths of 300m, propagating at speeds of about : =
22ms7!, are common in the Pacific—see the discussion in [17]; the corresponding value of the : 3
speed predicted by the dispersion relation c = ,/¢/k is, therefore, quite accurate. : >

The second modified f-plane approximation we consider was derived in [49]. This non- D8
traditional approximation was motivated by the fact that, from a mathematical modelling : 3
perspective, an appreciable level of mathematical detail and structure must be lost as a result of 8

the ‘flattening out’ of the Earth’s surface which follows from the standard £-plane approximation. An approach which retains some artefacts of the geometry of the Earth’s curvature by way
of incorporating a gravitational correction term into the standard f-tangent plane model is
as follows. We now neglect centripetal terms in (1.1), and in considering the form that the
gravitational body force F takes following the linearization procedure, we accommodate a
correction term which incorporates the deviation of the tangent plane from the Earth’s curved
surface.
