It will be seen that these formule represent the isomerides as containing four
hydroxyl groups, and in support of this assumption may be brought forward the fact
that each forms a tetracetyl derivative. On the other hand, luteolin and lotoflavin
form with methyl iodide only trimethyl ethers instead of the tetramethyl ethers which
might be expected. This phenomenon of incomplete methylation is also exhibited by
quercetin and myricetin, which are other members of this class of colouring matters,
and also by various hydroxy-derivatives, such as B-resoreylic acid ; the common feature

in these cases being that each of these compounds contains a hydroxyl group in the
so-called ortho position to a carbonyl group. This is the case with one hydroxyl
group in the formule given above for lotoflavin and luteolin.
