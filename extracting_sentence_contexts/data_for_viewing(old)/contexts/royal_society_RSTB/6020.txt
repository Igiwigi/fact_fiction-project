fully capable in view of his mental and physical organization of being the sole artificer
of the cultural debris associated with his skeletal remains.

Finally there remains to be noted the generic status of Sinanthropus. The latter
was conferred upon that hominid upon the basis of definite and distinctive morphological
characters which probably would have received but little if any criticism had a form
other than hominid been involved. The generic name Sinanthropus was created to be a
useful tool. The names Paleoanthropus, Hoanthropus, Pithecanthropus, and Sinanthropus
are at once useful and distinctive, the last one particularly so since its derivation is so
obviously zoogeographic, carrying with it no implication of preconceived relationship.
Ideas regarding the latter must necessarily change from time to time as new evidence
becomes available. When, therefore, definite morphological facts permit, it would seem
desirable to accord generic status of zoogeographical significance to a new discovery
of truly ancient hominid remains, and thus to avoid at the outset prejudicing or rendering
obscure the ultimate issue of their precise relationship within the hominid group.
