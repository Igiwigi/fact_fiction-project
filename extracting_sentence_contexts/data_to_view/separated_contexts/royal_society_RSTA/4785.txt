We should expect further
that, as a generator can be made into a motor by reversing the current in the
armature, wherever local currents diminish E.M.F. of a generator, they would
increase E.M.F. of a motor. That is, we should expect that local currents would
diminish E..M.F. from lead 0° to 180°, and increase E.M.F. from 180° to 860°. As a
fact, we find this to be partially verified; it seems that local currents diminish
E.M.F. from a negative angle of comparative small amount, perhaps 30°, to consider-
ably more than 90°, and that they increase E.M.F. from 180° to over 270°. Referring to the curves in fig. 14, « and E, are in phase, and Je, dt would need
increasing 3 per cent.
