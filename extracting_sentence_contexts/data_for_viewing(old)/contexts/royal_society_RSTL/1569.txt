posite direction, by the influence of gravitation ; and I believe
the facts I have stated to be sufficient to support the inferences

less succulent, though not uninfluenced in the directions they
take by gravitation, are, to a great extent, obedient to other
laws, and are generally found to extend themselves most
rapidly, and to the greatest length, in whatever direction the
Soil is most favourable : whence many naturalists have been
disposed to believe that these are guided by some degrees of
feeling and perception, analogous to those of animal life.

I shall proceed to state some of the facts upon which this
