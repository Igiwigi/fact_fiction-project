On comparing the strengths of the different irons, it appears that the Derbyshire
and Staffordshire plates are nearly equal, the former indicating 20-165 tons as the
mean of the breaking weight per square inch, and the latter, as in the preceding
Table, 2028 tons per square inch. The same comparison further applies to the above
and those made on the Derbyshire plates in Table III.

Taking therefore the results as derived from these experiments, it will be observed,
that in every instance little or no difference appears to exist in the resisting powers
of plates, whether drawn in the direction of the fibre or across it. This fact is clearly
established by the following comparison, which evidently shows, that in whatever
direction the plates are torn asunder, their strength is nearly the same.
