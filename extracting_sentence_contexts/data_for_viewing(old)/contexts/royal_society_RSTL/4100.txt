glass. This is the only continuing effect I have observed; and this effect is not con-

tinuing in a Daguerreotype sense, it has no relation to the property of attracting the
mercurial yapour; on the contrary, it will be seen from the experiments which I am
about to describe, that the radiations of red, orange and yellow glasses entirely de-
stroy this property. There exists then a certain analogy between the action of the

red, orange and yellow glasses upon the photogenic papers and the Daguerreotype
plate; and this continuing action is probably due to the distinet photogenie action
possessed by these rays, as T am able to prove by facts of a very positive nature.

These two photogenic actions result from two different principles, nevertheless
producing similar effects, as to the colour obtained, on the iodide, bromide or chloride
of silver, whether it be found isolated, as is the case on the photogenic paper, or it
be found in the presence of metallic silver, as happens upon the Daguerreotype plate ;
but they produce quite an opposite effect upon the silyer plate, whatever may be the
colour previously given to the surface by these two radiations, endowing it with a
property, the one of attracting, the other of repelling the mercurial vapours. We
must take care not to confound these two results ; we can conceive two different
actions giving the same colour to the iodide of silver, and we can also conceive that
these two actions may be endowed with contrary properties as regards the fixation
of mercurial vapour.
