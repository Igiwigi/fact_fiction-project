electron was done by J.J. Thomson, who argued that the electric lines of field of an accelerated
charge undergo a distortion as illustrated in figure 3a [33]. Although Thomson’s picture was
highly intuitive and led to a better understanding of the nature of geometric lines of force
associated with charges under radiation, for a long time there was no effort to develop a
mathematical model corresponding to distortions in the electric lines of field from the framework
of broken symmetries. Interpretation of the distortions in electric lines of force associated with an
accelerated charge as a consequence of breaking of the translational symmetry of the electric field
in the radial direction within a localized region of space and time due to rotation of the electric
field, which results in generation of electromagnetic waves as shown in figure 3b, was published
recently [34,35]. Thus, although a periodic acceleration of the dipole configuration of charged
particles results in electromagnetic radiation which is associated with generation of rotating
electric field in space is well known, its correlation to loss of temporal and spatial invariance
of the associated Lagrangian has remained unnoticed, for long. In fact, it is an instance of explicit
