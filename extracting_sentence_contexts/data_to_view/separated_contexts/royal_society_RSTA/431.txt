The assumption that the primary action of grit is mechanical rather than thermal cannot
be regarded as completely proved by the present experiments, but it can be stated that if
the action of grit is to favour hot spots, as appears to be the case with high explosives (part
III (1)), then the temperature of these hot spots must be so high that 100Â° rise in the starting
temperature makes little difference. (See also III (4).) This suggested sensitiveness of some initiators to mechanical action in the strict sense as
distinct from the sensitiveness to hot spots produced by mechanical action might be associ-

ated with the fact that the majority of them are salts, whose lattice energy is very considerably

greater than that of organic high explosives. Breaking of the crystals might be expected to
have an effect of initiating detonation when the lattice energy is high (cf. I).
