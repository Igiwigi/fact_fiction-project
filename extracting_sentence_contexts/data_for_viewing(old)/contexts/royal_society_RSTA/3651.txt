level. The idea that educational improvement actually lags development rather than the other
way around has been suggested by others [30,43]. More data on the relationships between MF
and life expectancy, years of education and the GINI coefficient can be found in the electronic
supplementary material.

As far as we know, the only way large nations can move up along the path suggested in
figure 5 is by industrialization. If successful, these countries will eventually export manufactured
goods to others including those more developed countries in the second stage. The wealthier
countries in the second stage will, in turn, be transitioning from manufacturing to service based
economies, and will be increasingly buying goods from other nations including those in stage
one. Hence these two stages are highly coupled. Consumption in the developed world goes to
provide manufacturing jobs and opportunities in the industrializing, developing countries. In
fact, exporting is an important part of industrialization. A recent analysis called exports the single
most important driver of economic booms [30].

6. The role of material efficiency

We have seen that up to the present day human well-being and materials use have been
inextricably linked. On average, the annual material footprint of each human being is currently
10 metric tons, but no country with an HDI equal to or greater than 0.9 (such as the United States)
has a material footprint less than 20 t per cap. Is it possible to lift the bulk of humanity to a state of
wellbeing equivalent to that enjoyed in the developed world without requiring a doubling of our
material production? A potential solution is to pursue materially efficient strategies (providing
material services using less raw material) by, for example, making lightweight products, using
products for longer and reusing components at product end-of-life. The technical (physical)
