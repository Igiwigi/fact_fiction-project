The above is an illustration of the familiar fact that the intensity of the electrical
response varies directly with the number of elements thrown into activity.*
If it is compared with those in the first chart, it is evident that the primary initial
effect commences in the same way, and subsides in the same way, but that its
intensity is decreased to a little less than one half.

Section 2.—Haperiments on Irreciprocal Resistance.

As in the case of Torpedot and of Raia batis,t it was found that strips cut from
the isolated organ respond to the passage of an electrical current through their
substance. For this purpose the exciting current must obviously be a tolerably
intense one, and the most convenient to use is the induced current.
