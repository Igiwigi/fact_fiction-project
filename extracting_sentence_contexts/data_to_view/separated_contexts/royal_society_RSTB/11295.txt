Infants do not seem to have the same circadian patterns
hormonal exposures can lead to potentially long-term of cortisol release throughout the first few months [55]. Collec-
health and mental health effects as well as changes in brain tively, studies have demonstrated that infantsâ€™ cortisol

than 15 different hormones that could potentially be involved ing patterns differentially impact their cortisol levels, although
with fetal and infant developmental patterns, including hor- generally reactive cortisol responses are moderate during stres-
mones that have to do with birthing, breastfeeding, maternal sor exposures. An increase in cortisol, followed by a fairly quick
psychological conditions and other neuroendocrine and neu- response cessation, is an adaptive event, as cortisol mobilizes
rophysiological processes occurring during gestation and energy in order to provide the periphery with the fuel necess-
infant development. A significant number of neuroendocrine ary to increase perceptual awareness and attention to deal with
processes can potentially influence and interact in the devel- acute stress [56].
