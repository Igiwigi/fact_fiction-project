CLARKE ON THE GREY SUBSTANCE OF THE SPINAL CORD.

roots of the nerves, or escape through the anterior columns ; while those from
posterior ends extend backwards to different distances, and form a continuous 8tratum
of fibres along the lateral margin of the grey substance: some of them join the fibres
which radiate from the centre, and contribute in succession to form the bundles which
escape as a network through the antero-lateral column ; others extend as far as the
posterior cornu, and seem to be continuous with the posterior roots which escape
through the postero-lateral fissure. 'The rest of the posterior roots partly descend towards
the centre of the anterior cornu, and partly cross the posterior cornu diagonally in
connexion with a chain of cells, to be continuous with the transverse commissure, In
the cervical enlargement (fig. 45), the cells of the anterior cornu are more numerous
and more diversified in shape; some of them send processes. towards the anterior com-
missure, but a great number have no apparent connexion with it. In my firs: communication on the s8pinal cord, I stated that the posterior roots of the
spinal nerves are attached exclusively to the posterior white columns. T have since
found that the same assertion was made by RoLaxD0: he says, © tutti i fili nervosi delle
radici posteriori 8 staccano esclusivamente dai cordoni posteriori del gran funicolo spi-
nale; cio che puo essere comprovato in yarie e differenti maniere#*.” S7T111x6 denies
the fact, and maintains that in the lumbar region a few fibres traverse the posterior part
of the antero-lateral column. I have again carefully gone over the ground, in the cord
both of Man and different animals, and find that my statement is correct. ST1L11NG has
probably confounded nerve-fibres with the blood-yessels which traverse the posterior part
of the antero-lateral column much in the way that he represents.
