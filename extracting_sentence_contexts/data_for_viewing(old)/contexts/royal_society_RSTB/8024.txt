partitions subdivide to form an anastomosing framework throughout the cortex, a condition
clearly seen in the section of the testis photographed in figure 19, plate 7. Graafian
follicles occur throughout the cortex of the foetal ovary, but most of the larger ones, which
attain a diameter of about 2 mm, occur near the periphery. There are also many follicles
without antra, many of them with only a single layer of epithelium. One of the larger
follicles, which is polyovular, is shown in figure 20a, plate 7.

The most striking feature of the ovary at this stage is undoubtedly the great degree of
hypertrophy of the interstitial tissue. A small proportion of the excess of bulk of the foetal
as compared with the neonatal ovary is due to slight enlargement of the peripheral
follicles, but by far the greater part of it is due to the interstitial tissue. It may be remarked
at this point that the elephant ovary resembles that of the mare, not only in that the
interstitial tissue is rendered conspicuous during foetal life, but also in the fact of its being
remarkably inconspicuous in adult life. In both animals the increase in weight of the
ovary during pregnancy appears to be attributable almost entirely to the growth of the
corpora lutea and the increased vascular supply involved in their development. This is in
contrast with the sequence of events in some other animals, in which the interstitial cells

are conspicuous in the reproductive processes of the adult. The most extreme example yet
described is that of the water shrew, Neomys fodiens, where the interstitial tissue hyper-
trophies during pregnancy to such an extent that the whole ovary at first sight appears to
consist of a single mass of luteal tissue, and the individual interstitial cells are indis-
