In answer to my inquiries, Mr. STRICKLAND
= stated, that upon comparing the femur with that of the Megalosaurus, it was evident -
[= that it belonged to a different genus: and he had labelled it * Cetiosaurus,” from its
& resemblance to portions of femora and other hones found in the same locality,
6 and 80 named in the Oxford Museum; and likewise, because in the crushed mass
= of bony fibre which filled the interior, he did not perceive any traces of a medullary
E cavity; but it is quite possible, Mr, STrrckLAanD adds, © that such a cavity may have
= existed, though now 80 much obliterated by compression as to have escaped my ob-

servation.”

The character of the condyloid extremity, and the general form of this bone, appear
to me to separate it from the femur of the marine reptiles, to which it has been re-
ferred, provisionally, by this distinguisbed naturalist ; if upon a more accurate ex-
amination a medullary cavity should be detected, there will be strong grounds for
as8igning this gigantic thigh-bone to the Pelyrosaurus; on the contrary, if the shaft
Should prove to be solid throughout, the supposed relation of this femur to the
humerus previously described, will of course be negatived. Summary —From the facts described he following inferences result :—
