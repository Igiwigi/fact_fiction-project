and that the series on the right converges uniformly for values of s in (a, 6). It is easy to show directly that the series on the right of (2) is absolutely
convergent. The result, however, follows at once from the fact that we have
throughout left the order of the terms of the series arbitrary, which would otherwise
have been impossible, by RreEMANN’s theorem on derangement. §2. We may here digress to prove a slight extension of the Hilbert-Schmidt
expansion theorem,* applicable when «(s,t) has the properties mentioned above.
