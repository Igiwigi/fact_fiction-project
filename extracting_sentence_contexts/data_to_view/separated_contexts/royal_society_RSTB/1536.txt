Out of forty-three adult females of M. rhesus which were examined, twenty-two of
them had no sign of a corpus luteum, or as I will call it a “discharged follicle,” in
either ovary ; of these, fourteen were menstruating females, while the remaining eight
were not menstruating at the time. On the other hand in twenty-one females a more
or less prominent discharged follicle was present; of these, sixteen were pregnant
females, or females which had very recently borne or aborted their young ; while of the
remaining five, one was a female which I am inclined to think had aborted her young,
but Iam not certain of the fact and consider this case doubtful (fig. 7), one was a
non-pregnant, non-menstruating female (fig. 8), and three only were females in which
menstruation was in progress at the time they were killed (figs. 5, 6 and 9).
