A key objective of the present work is to obtain insight on wave propagation through more
complex arrangements of resonators, for example, when they are tiled periodically to form finite

clusters, gratings, or lattices [13,14]. The scatterer considered here is a canonical geometry for ard
two-dimensional metamaterials, and following an established nomenclature in the literature (i.e. :8
Melnikov et al. [15]) our resonator is considered to be a ‘meta-atom’. This terminology arises from [3
the fact that a two-dimensional periodic lattice of such resonators can give rise to a metamaterial, a)
a type of composite material that exhibits unusual and unexpected properties that are not readily :8

In addition to our multipole-matched asymptotic solution, we also compute cross-sections 1&8
for a single cylindrical Helmholtz resonator. These are measures of strength for different wave
processes, for example, describing how much incident power is scattered or absorbed by the
resonator. We also evaluate extinction cross-sections, which refer to the power loss in the
downstream direction to the incident field (where a detector or observer would be located), due
to the presence of the object [1].
