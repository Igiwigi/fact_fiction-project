The ventro-lateral septa (Â».1.s.) extend
Jackwards gome distance beyond the point of union of the above-mentioned septa,
Ind then bend upwards to join the peduncular septum at the point u (fig. 104). In
Zome cages it is difficult to trace the septum up to the peduncular septum, especially
Shen the larva is fully expanded. In fact, I completely overlooked their connexion
E my earlier paper, and described the septum as terminating freely below. In some

mens this appears to be actually the case, though it is difficult to make sure of it,

But in every case the line of longitudinal muscles accompanying the septum (see p. 780)
continued up to the peduncular septum, The ventral septa (v.s.) are of nearly the
game length as the dorsal, and in some specimens appear to terminate freely below. In most cases, however, careful examination during a half-contracted state of the larva
Shows that the lower ends of the septa bend towards one another and unite in the
Enedian ventral line.
