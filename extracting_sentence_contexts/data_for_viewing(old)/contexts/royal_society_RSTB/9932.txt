observer. To infer the impact of masking by terrain in the present study, a
mountain 2000 m high was placed eastward from the city. The summit of the
mountain is located 30 km away from the city centre. Then, the observer was
placed 80 km from the city centre at both sides of the city so that for the eastern
observer, the mountain completely blocked the direct light from the city. The
ratio of the radiance without blocking by the mountain over the radiance
with blocking by the mountain as a function of the zenith angle is given in
figure 17. This figure tells us that for most viewing angles, the terrain blocking
only slightly reduces the sky’s radiance. The radiance without the mountain is
only 1.03 times the radiance with the mountain on average, from z = —60° to
z= 85°. This factor increases rapidly for reverse angles larger than 60° (z <
—60°). The highest factor, of approximately 2.3, is obtained at 85°, the highest
zenith angle computed. This rapid increase can be explained by the fact that
at such angles, the observer's line of sight crosses the shadow of the mountain
for most of its trajectory into the atmosphere.
