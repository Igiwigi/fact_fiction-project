As explained in the previous sections, the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) method [12], in
principle, can be used for the image reconstruction using muon data. However, this method was
not widely adopted by researchers. There are several reasons that are responsible for this. The first
one is that this method needs to have a muon beam in order to be able to calculate the muon beam
attenuation and to calculate the scattering angle distribution width. This shortcoming can be
accounted for by using a relatively long measuring time. The second reason is that muon imaging
techniques are naturally three-dimensional imaging methods, thanks to the random cosmic ray
muon source. Therefore, specially designed three-dimensional FBP methods are needed for muon
imaging problems, which require extensive research efforts to develop. However, in some special
cases, the three-dimensional imaging problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional imaging
problem.

A good example for this is vertical nuclear spent fuel casks. Owing to the fact that spent fuel
assemblies are very long, spent fuel casks have the same profile at different positions along the
vertical direction if we ignore the lid and bottom parts. Therefore, for any muon path, if we shift
it in the vertical direction to a new position, then the materials encountered along the new path
will be the same as along the original path, therefore the bin size in the vertical direction can be as
large as the cask itself. Furthermore, we noticed that for muons with the same azimuthal angle,
x- and y-coordinates, but different zenith angles and z-coordinates, their expected water
