as having a share in these results, if it he supposed included
in the cavity, no exact conclusions can. be drawn from the
apparent degree of contraction of the water ; particularly as
the late ingenious researches of Mr. PERKINs $how, that water
is much more compressible than was formerly imagined ; and
the volume of water, however high its temperature, must be
influenced by the pressure to which it is exposed ; 80 that a
certain compressing weight may not only impede, but alto-
gether counteract the expansive force of heat.

Many speculations might be indulged in on this subject, but
I shall not at present enter upon them ; and I shall conclude
by observing, that a fact, which has been considered by the
Neptunists, above all others as hostile to the idea of the igne-
ous origin of crystalline rocks, namely, the existence of water
in them, seems to afford a decisive argumentin favour of the
opinion it has been brought forward to oppose,
