dependence of the value required on the F-sequence of Al, whilst the corresponding
. value from T] is very different, viz., ‘962661. For suppose the F-sequence takes the
form m+ group constant +A (1—m-) (see Part I.). The A for Al and TI are
respectively ‘001754 and °134153, whilst m is always 2 for the first line of the
F series. Hence the difference of the values of the denominators of the F series
of Al and Tl is $('134153—‘001754) = ‘06620, whilst the values found are
*962611—"956239 = 006372, sufficiently close to show that the above explanation
may be on the right lines. The fact that ‘014 and ‘0437 are in the ratio 1 : 3, i.c., of
the valencies of the Groups I. and III., may be a coincidence, but should be borne in
mind for future testing. The results for these two groups suggest a similar kind of
group constant for Zn and the Mg sub-groups of IT., but if so no F series have yet
been observed to determine them. It is at least to the point to notice that such a
term would raise the coefficients of the Zn set (002715) more to an equality with the
values (‘002755) of the Al set.

The evidence for the dependence of the p-sequence on the atomic volume is
therefore strong from all the cases in combination. The actual value of the constant
((002740) cannot be accurately determined as yet, because we have no knowledge of
the actual value for any element of the physical quantity we denote by “ atomic
volume”; but it is probably not far from ‘002740. The results of the foregoing
