Q XII. Tur Bargran LecTURE.—On the Theoretical Explanation of an apparent new
Q Polarity in Light. By G. B. Airy, Esq. M.4. F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.

S IN the Report of the Seventh Meeting of the British Asociation*®, and in that of
£ the Eighth Meeting +, Sir Daviv Brewsres has given a short account of experiments
Z which haye led him to infer the existence of a polarity, in the rays of homogeneous
= light, having regard only to the sequence of colours in the spectrum. I am aware
= that Sir Davip BrewsTeR has announced his intention of publishing a more elaborate
S paper upon these experiments. But as the leading facts of- the experiments have now
= been communicated to the public nearly two years, and by Sir Davip Brewsrer
© himself, and as the accounts have been sufficiently explanatory to enable any other
> person to repeat the experiments, and as various persons have in consequence re-
= peated them, there cannot, I conceive, be the most trifling impropriety in making the
£ whole subject a matter of discussion, experimental and theoretical.

< As the experimental facts observed by myself differ from those of Sir David Brzw-
S$ STER in a degree which, as regards the experiment, is trifling (and might easily pass
S unobserved), but which, as regards the theory, is important ; I think it necessary to
S give the following brief history. My first repetition of the experiment was made in
S October, 1839, in consequence of a friend requesting my opinion upon a proposed
theoretical explanation. To that friend I immediately communicated (by letter) the
