ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS. 277

able to infer that the subsequent arousing of the insect from this hybernating condi-
tion arises, in addition to the stimulus of increased temperature in the surrounding
medium, partly also from the stimulus of a more perfect aeration of its fluids, through
means of the greater quantity of air which necessarily enters its enlarging respiratory
organs. These opinions are 8upported by the facts that some insects pass into the
pupa state at two different periods of the year, and that their 8ubsequent development
into the perfect state depends upon the period at which they enter into the pupa. Thus the common Cabbage Butterflies, Papilio brassice, Lixx., and P. Napi, Laxx.,
when changed from larva to pupz in the middle of summer, become perfect insects
within a fortnight; but when the change into the pupa state takes place at the end
of summer, the perfect insects are not developed until the following Spring, unless,
as shown long ago by Reaunus, they are placed in a warm atmosphere, when they
may at any time be deyeloped within @ few days, eyen in the months of December
and January. Besides these facts, and a variety of others which are equally well
known, eyery one is aware that the hybernation of many insects occurs at compara-
tively high degrees of temperature.
