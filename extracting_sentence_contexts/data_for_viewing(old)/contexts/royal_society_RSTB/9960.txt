rates leads to a lower absolute number of potential allopar-
ents [129]. Declining extrinsic environmental risks render
the returns to parental investment more certain, encouraging
greater investment and making the dilution of such investment a
greater relative determinant of offspring success. In addition, the
scope of sibling competition over material capital is increased
dramatically by the introduction of modern skill-based labour
economies, where human capital takes longer to instil via
formal education and work experience [82,129]. Accordingly,
the best evidence of sibling competition in developing
populations comes from those that are more economically devel-
oped or from relatively urban zones within developing
populations [8,16,130]. Indeed, the very fact that most evolution-
ary anthropological researchers come from such populations
may have led to the appeal of the quantity—quality model.
Many evolutionary demographers have argued that
modern fertility decline may be adaptive as part of an optimal
regulation of the quantity—quality trade-off, provided sub-
stantial economic rewards are bestowed on descendants
[35,88,131,132]. Multigenerational studies confirm, however,
that modern low fertility rates are unlikely to be fitness-
maximizing, with low fertility benefiting descendent material
and somatic capital, but having little impact on descendant sur-
vival or reproductive success [5,6]. In short, parents are not
effective in trading off quantity for quality in such a way as
