Moreover, the cumbersomeness of using
different instruments to analyse one sample is preferably avoided. The recent development of
hybrid devices combining the benefits of multiple instruments, therefore, allows researchers to
use the same tool for various purposes [17,18]. Two interesting examples are the QTrap and
the QTOF, which are in fact triple quadrupoles wherein the last quadrupole is replaced by a
linear ion trap or a TOF tube, respectively. As a result, the high speed and sensitivity of a
conventional QQQ is combined with a higher resolution in the case of a QTOF or with MS"-
capability in case of a QTrap, respectively. When comparing these two instruments, it should be
noted that both devices are extremely suitable for both identification and quantification [17,19,20].
