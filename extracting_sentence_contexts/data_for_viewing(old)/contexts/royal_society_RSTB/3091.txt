prolonged expansion, and the very rapid flow of urine, commencing 31 minutes after the injection of

ON THE ACTION OF PITUITARY EXTRACTS UPON THE KIDNEY. 19

One of the most interesting facts in connection with the action of pituitary extract
is the prolonged period of latency which sometimes—especially in the dog and rabbit,
less often in the cat—intervenes between the intravenous injection and the effect
upon the secretion of urine. This is most marked where there has previously been
a suppression of urine, in which case several minutes may elapse before the effect on
the urine shows itself, although the effects upon blood-pressure and kidney volume
are at once manifested. Figs. 17, 18, and 19 show such a result, but with blood-
pressure and urine flow alone registered. The kidneys and ureters were left
untouched in this instance and the urine was collected by a drainage tube tied into
