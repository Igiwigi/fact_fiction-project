Mr. Powe.t, of the Botanic Gardens, informed
us that the foliage of the more tender plants was blighted and turned yellow, and
all the forward bread-fruit dropped, not from the weight, but from the nature of the
ash. The plants with stout thick leaves suffered comparatively little damage, and in
fact it was noticed that a few days afterwards their foliage was cleaner, greener, and
more free from insects than before, so that there was reason to believe that the
ash had insecticidal properties. Lamps had to be lighted in Kingstown about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and
although the darkness was not intense before nightfall, the air was so full of falling
dust that the appearances resembled those of a very thick, dark city fog. During the
night the noises continued, but apparently no further showers of stones occurred.
