As regards the depth of the non-conducting layer, 200 to 300 km., it may be
noticed that Hr_merr||, and also TrrrmaNn and Hayrorp1, have concluded that
the inequalities in the distribution of mass near the earth’s surface extend down
to a depth of 120 km.; variations in the electrical properties of the earth seem
therefore to extend below this region of variation of elasticity.

§19. The Solar Diurnal Barometric Variation.

As was remarked in § 6, the atmospheric motions to which the daily magnetic
variations are to be attributed, on the Srewart-Scuuster theory, are the horizontal
and not the vertical movements. Before proceeding with the study of the magnetic
variations, a brief statement will be made of the principal relevant facts regarding
the daily circulation and electrical conductivity of the atmosphere.
