Concerning the forward growth of mesodermal bands in the Onycho-
phora: their development is simpler than it is in most annelids as well as arthropods, see
next section. Primary and secondary metamerism in segmented animals, and the primitive character
of the Onychophora
Much has been written recently concerning primary and secondary segmentation
(Iwanoff 1928, 1933 and 1944; Snodgrass 1938), which Iwanoff (1944) claims to have the
significance of a new principle of morphology. A review of this theory seems called for, as
the facts appear to be open to a somewhat different interpretation. * Neither Nair nor Manton has observed any extra blastoporal immigration in the Malacostraca, other
than that of the pre-antennulary mesoderm which comes from the germinal bands.
