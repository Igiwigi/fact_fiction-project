This choice was based on the fact that the hyperbolic functions ensure (2.6) at the boundaries
a = Py and 6 = Q,. The parameter values were calculated to be as in table 1 and shown, along
with the estimations of data points, gand yy, in figure 2. It should be noted that since Mg = 1 then
the conditions of (2.4) are satisfied while the fact that Jy, <0 ensures (2.5). Note that there is no
suggestion that ¢ = é only that gis an approximation of ¢, similarly for y. Having defined functions E, F, é and v, problem is solved if the pair (a, b) that solves (2.19) is
found and when used in (2.17) and (2.18) satisfies (2.12)-(2.14).
