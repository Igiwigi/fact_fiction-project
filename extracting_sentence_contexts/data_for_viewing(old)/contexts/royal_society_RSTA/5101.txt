when a single non-metallic atom constitutes the bridge). In such systems, there is a substantial
spin on both metal centre and ligand which leads to very large magnetic superexchange constants,
and the propagation of strong magnetic interactions is facile in the direction(s) of network
propagation.

For example, antiferromagnetic AgSO, exhibits a strong quasi-one-dimensional superex-
change along the infinite [Ag(SO,)] chains characterized by a superexchange constant, J, of
—18.7 meV [25].5 This number is impressive while taking into account that the superexchange
pathway formally consists of three atoms, i.e. of the OSO bridge. Note that similar J value
(—19meV) is observed for antiferromagnetic NiO, with the monoatomic bridge (O atom)
between the Ni centres, and as many as two unpaired electrons per site (Ni(II) in high-spin
d® configuration). Closer inspection of the calculated spin density in AgSO, shows that the
superexchange pathway in fact omits the sulfur atom as it polarizes the O- --O bridge. This is
peculiar, since no chemical bond exists between the neighbouring O atoms of the sulfate anion.
Clearly, Ag(II) cation is capable of spin-polarizing the adjacent anion so strongly that it induces a
fractional chemical bonding between O atoms. We will come back to this unusual feature in §8.

KAgF; is another exemplification of very strong magnetic superexchange in Ag(II) systems.
Although its crystal structure is related to that of the KZnF3 perovskite, the small local distortions
of the AgF bond lengths and the Ag-F—Ag bond angles lead to a quasi-one-dimensional structure

5The J constant given in the original paper must be multiplied by 2 to comply with the magnetic Hamiltonian used in other
works. A slightly smaller absolute value (J = —15.4meV) has been measured for Ag, (SO3F)s with its infinite [Ag(SO3F)*]
chains [28].
