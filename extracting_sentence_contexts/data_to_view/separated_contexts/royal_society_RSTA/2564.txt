But, as we know from the current papers in Algebraic
Topology, referring to pictures you can prove essentially anything. For instance, that any
triangle is equilateral. By purely accidental circumstances, the facts usually presented as theorems in school textbooks
are true (in this case, can be deduced from Hilbert’s axioms), but this does not make their
traditional proofs any more correct. For instance, Euclid’s proof of the fact that the diagonals of
a parallelogram bisect each other (the one reproduced in Wikipedia) already uses much more
difficult facts that they intersect inside the parallelogram or, for that matter, that they do intersect
at all! As was gradually discovered between the third century B.C and the nineteenth century
A.D., the reason is that Euclid’s text missed a whole bunch of axioms (or, in fact, at least two such
bunches, betweenness and continuity), necessary to derive his claims.

measurement, and can therefore live well with incorrect proofs’.
