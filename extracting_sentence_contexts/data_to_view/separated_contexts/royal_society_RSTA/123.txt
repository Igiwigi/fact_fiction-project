As the
numbers 1, 8, 7? forma basis of k(@), the numbers of the form w~!(u-+4v + 6?w) are the integers
of k(@), and so there is an integral unimodular substitution from u, v, w to u’, v’, w’ such that

u+Ov+@w = o(u' +00'+6w'),

u+dv+¢?w = o'(u'+¢v'+¢?w’),

ut+yo+ pu =o'(u'+yo' +P’),
where o’ and w” are the conjugates of w in k(¢) and k(y). Omitting the accents we can now
writet

x=u+ot+oew, y=ut+fot+fw, z=ut+ywt+yu,

where a, f, y is a permutation of 0, ¢, y. Since an interchange of X and Y in theorem 11 does
not affect either the hypothesis or the conclusion, we can suppose that «, f, y is a cyclic
permutation of 4, ¢, 7. t This result can also be deduced, using the fact that (1, 1, 1) is a lattice point, from the proof of lemma
5 given in Davenport (1943).


334 H. DAVENPORT AND CG. A. ROGERS ON DIOPHANTINE Having determined the nature of the lattice A, we now return to the lattice A,, which
converges to Aas n-+00 through some sequence of positive integers.
