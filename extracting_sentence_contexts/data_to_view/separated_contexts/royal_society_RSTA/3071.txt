There is
also no sophisticated treatment of land-use management in the current generation of Earth system
models yet. As a result, so-called permissible CO? emissions associated with a given concentration
or temperature pathway may not be directly comparable to the net global CO2 emissions as
per UNFCCC reporting rules when there is a significant contribution from CO removals by
ecosystems [16]. Finally, natural sinks can persist up to several decades after CO2 concentrations
have peaked in 1.5°C or 2°C mitigation pathways [17] due to the fact that the carbon cycle is
currently out of equilibrium. The prospect of novel CDR techniques can raise new and different sets of questions. CDR
technologies can be broadly grouped according to where they store the atmospheric CO3.
