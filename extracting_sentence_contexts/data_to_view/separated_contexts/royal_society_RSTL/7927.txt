Survey, Dec, 10, 1861. At that time, when Zepidosiren was till the only repre-
s8entative of Mvrrxr's subclass Dipnoi, Professor HuxLey pointed at its affinity to certain Ganoids :â€”* Without
wishing to lay too much stress upon the fact, T may draw attention to the many and singular relations which
obtain between that wonderful and apparently isolated fish, Zepidosiren, sole member of its order, and the cycloid
Glyptodipterine, Ctenododipterine, Phaneropleurine, and Colacanth Crossopterygide. Lepidosiren is, in fact,
the only living fish whose pectoral and yentral members haye a structure analogous to that of tho acutely lobate,
paired fins of Holoptychius, of Dipterus, or of Phaneropleuron, though the fin-rays and surface-scales are still
less developed in the modern than in the ancient fich, The endoskeleton of Zepidosiren, again, is as nearly as
pos8ible in the 8ame condition as that of Phaneropleuron, and is more nearly similar to the skeleton of the
Caolacanths than that of any other recent fish [quare Acipenser? A. G.]; while, perhaps, it is not stretching the
8earch for analogies too far to discover in the stiff-walled lungs of Lepidosiren a structure more nearly repre-
senting the ossified air-bladder of the Cozlacanths than any with which we are at present acquainted, among
recent or fossil fishes. Furthermore, Lepidosiren is the only fish whose teeth are comparable in form and
arrangement to those of Dipterus.
