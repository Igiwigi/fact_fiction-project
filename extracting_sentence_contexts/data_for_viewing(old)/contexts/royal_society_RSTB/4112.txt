The Monocotyledons are the rarer, and therefore perhaps the younger, in each case.
But when we add up the totals of each kind, such is the greater proportion of endemic
Dicotyledons that the Dicotyledons as a whole have a rarity of 3°49 to 3°47. On the
other hand, this greater proportion of endemic Dicotyledons may be used as an
argument that they are the older group, and have therefore had more time. to give
rise to endemics. We find in fact :
