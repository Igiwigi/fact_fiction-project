Penicillium show superhydrophobic surfaces resulting from minute rodlets on the vegetative
hyphae, specifically conidiophores (figure 11). The surfaces are most probably formed from a
specific class of proteins called hydrophobins [144,145], but wax-like hydrocarbons might also
be involved (figure 11). Fungi are not only specialized to live on plant surfaces, but they also
are simultaneously capable of dissolving epicuticular wax layers and also locally modifying the


wetting properties, therefore creating its own microhabitat. They probably do this by excreting a
certain type of surfactant, which is also known from epiphyllous bacteria.

Similar structures have been described in lichens. In view of the results that some lichens
also have superhydrophobic external and internal surfaces, they may represent a second lineage
that developed such adaptations [146,147]. In fact, only the fungal partner exhibits hydrophobic
surface characteristics, which points to fungi as a huge group of terrestrial organisms that most
probably colonized land in a close association with plants. Today, there are quite a number of
species known that exhibit superhydrophobic surfaces (see above).

Slime moulds (Mycetozoa) are a group of unrelated Protista, sometimes called social amoeba.
The spores of certain species are hydrophobic [80]. However, we have observed in Stemonitis
parts of the sporangia are superhydrophobic, in particular a nanoscopic layer of unknown
composition covers the sterile fibres (capillitium; figure 33). This new finding again proves:
(super)hydrophobicity evolved even if only a part of an organism is exposed to air or for the
dispersal of spores and fructification unit.
