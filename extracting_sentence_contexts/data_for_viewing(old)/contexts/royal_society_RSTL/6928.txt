of the general and intendant, I began then to in-
form myſelf of the neceſſary inſtrudtions for acquit-
ing myſelf of this dangerous commiſſion, the diſa-
greeable conſequences of which I eaſily foreſaw. 1
had ſo often heard of theſe leprous ſpots, that 1
judged it necefſary to know, whether what was faid
was true: for 1 could not comprehend, that a dif-
eaſe, which has ſo dreadful an end, and the ſym-
ptoms then fo terrible, ſhould continue ten or fifteen
years without any other appearance than theſe ſimple
ſpots; which, in themſelves, had nothing very bad.
I demanded an inqueſt to be made, in order to ſatisfy
myſelf of this fact : ſeveral ſurgeons, as practitioners,
and ſeveral honeft inhabitants, as obſervers, were ac-
cordingly called together, who all proved the fame
fa& in this inqueſt ; which you, Sir, may, and muſt,
have ſeen in the regiſter of the ſubdelegation of this
iſland, I am, moſt fincerely,

SIR,
Your moſt humble and obedient Servant,

Auguſt 10, 1748, Peyſlonel.
