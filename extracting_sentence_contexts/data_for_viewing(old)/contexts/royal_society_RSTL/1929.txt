the sphincters, the ejaculators, &c., and in that which supplies the tail ; and,
lastly, in reference to the several columns of which the spinal marrow is com-
posed. I think the investigation of the anatomy will, for various reasons, be
best pursned in the hedgehog.

It is gratifying to me to state that no part of these experiments has inflicted
pain, beyond that of prompt decapitation, or division of the spinal marrow.
'This is true, at least, if the conclusion be correct, that when the head is re-
moved from the body, sensation and volition cease, whilst the reflex function
and the irritability alone continue; and it may be satisfactory to the humane
to know that the motions of the eel, for example, after the head is removed,
are not motions arising from sensibility, but from another principle, as distinct
from feeling as the irritability of the mere nervo-muscular fibre. This fact will
snggest the propriety, as well as the means of avoiding such monstrous cruelty
as that of skinning eels alive. This will be effectually done by first removing
the head, however the animal may afterwards move on the application of sti-
muli, and appear to feel,

To avoid misapprehension, I think it right, in conclusion, very briefly to re-
capitulate the claims of this paper :
