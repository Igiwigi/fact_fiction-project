Though I have

- no reason to apprehend any error in the graduations, or in the values of the
S degrees, minutes, &c., into which the arc of this sector is supposed to be divided,
Z both are regarded as unknown elements, whose values, if necessary, might be
=> investigated, but into which, by reason of the system adopted, there is no
S occasion to inquire, further than to be satisfied that their errors are of an order
I 80 small as not to bring into question the identity of an object. S These are the data furnished by observation for every object in a complete
2 Sweep; and I shall now explain how from these data, compared with the mean
Z places of all those known objects which are to be found in authentic catalogues
= brought up to a given epoch, and which occur in a s&weep, the mean places
S of all the wnknown ones for the same epoch may be obtained, with the greatest
> degree of accuracy of which the system of observing is susceptible,—without the
7 necessity of taking into direct consideration any uranographical or instru-
5 mental correction whatever,—and that in a manner which, as will appear, carries
FI with it a moral certainty of eliminating (0 far as they can be eliniinated by
E any process) whatever errors may have been committed in the observations of
EZ the zero stars. In fact, if we consider all the corrections which we can pos-

E sibly have occasion to apply to obseryations of this kind, whether arising from

S the uranographical reductions, (viz. precession, aberration, nutation and refrac-

= tion,) or from instrumental mis-adjustment, such as extrameridional situation

z of the plane of the sweep, or its deviation from a vertical ; error and rate of

the chronometer ; error of evaluation of the divisions of the sector, &c.; or,
lastly, even from instability of the instrument itself, due to hygrometrical or
pyrometrical causes, whose operation, though very irregular, is still to a cer-
tain extent gradual ; we shall find that they are all functions of two quantities,
—the time elapsed since a given epoch, or, which comes to the same thing, the
