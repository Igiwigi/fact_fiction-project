The
form of the orifice in question is sometimes such as to suggest the idea of the mem-
brane having become cleft; in some instances appearing to have been first attenuated

very strong presumptive evidence that the central part of the altered germinal spot is

membrane F, an object yery much resembling a Spermatozoon which had increased in
8ize, Its large extremity was directed towards the interior of the ovum. Fig. 168.
represents a portion of this object ; the remainder having been too indistinctly seen
to admit of delineation.
