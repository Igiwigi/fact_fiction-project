Ampicillin, the first broad-spectrum B-lactam antibiotic with
activity encompassing Gram-negative bacteria was introduced
in 1961. However, this was followed just 4 years later by the
report of an ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolated from the blood
of a patient in Greece, the resistance being mediated by pro-
duction of a B-lactamase enzyme designated TEM-1 (derived
from the patient’s name, Temoniera) [43]. This was not entirely
a surprise as the existence of B-lactamases had been identi-
fied some 25 years earlier, with the first 6-lactamase in fact
having been found in an isolate of E. coli in 1940 [44]. What
was striking about the clinical isolate from Greece however,
was that the resistance was transferable (due to the resistance
gene being located on a mobile plasmid) not only between
strains of E. coli but also to other Enterobacteriaceae as well
as Haemophilus influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae and P. aeruginosa
[45-47]. In the early 1970s, the occurrence of ampicillin resist-
ance due to TEM-1 in H. influenzae type b, which at that time

was a significant cause of bacterial meningitis, was a major
public health concern, as was the adverse impact of TEM-1 on
the use of penicillin for the treatment of gonorrhoea.
