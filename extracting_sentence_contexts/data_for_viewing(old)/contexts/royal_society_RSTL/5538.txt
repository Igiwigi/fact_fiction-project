But we will not rely in the present instance upon our own observations alone. Before
he formed any theory of the structure, and in his first letter upon the subject, Professor
ForBgs remarks, that © the whole phenomenon has a good deal the air of a structure
induced perpendicularly to the lines of greatest pressure.” is later testimony is in 8ub-
stance the same. In his thirteenth letter, read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh
on the 2nd of December, 1846, he says that the blue veins are formed where the pressure
is most intense. In his reference to the development of the laminar structure on the
glacier of the Brenya, the pressure is described as being © violent,” the effect being 8uch
as to produce *© @ true cleavage when the ice is broken with a hammer or cut with an axe.”
So also with regard to the glacier of Allalein*, he says © the veined structure is especially
developed in front, 4. e. against the opposing side of the valley, where the pressure is
greater than laterally.” In fact, the paralleligm of the phenomenon to that of slaty
cleavage struck Professor ForBrs himself, as is evident from the use of the term * now”
in the following passage :—* It will be understood that I do not now suppose that there
is any parallelixm between the phenomenon of rocky cleavage and the ribboned structure
of the ice.” 'This reads like the giving up of a previously held opinion ; the term now
being printed in italics by Professor Forses himself. The adoption of the viscous theory
appears to have carried the renunciation of this idea in its train.

Later still, and from a source wholly independent of the former, we have received
additional testimony on the point in question. The following quotation is from a letter,
dated 16th November, 1856, received by one of us from Professor CLAUSIUS of Zavich,
80 well known in this country through his important memoirs on the Mechanical Theory
of Heat:—©* I must now,” writes M. CLausvs, © describe to you another singular coin-
