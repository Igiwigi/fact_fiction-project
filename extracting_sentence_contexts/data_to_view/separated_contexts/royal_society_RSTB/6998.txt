Pinus then
shows the marked increase which has already been mentioned as occurring in the recent
deposits. These two cores therefore show two striking differences from the marginal cores. First,
there is the compression of Zones IV, V and VI into about 25 cm. of deposit as compared
with 250 cm. in core 2, and the fact that all three pollen zones are here included in the
stratigraphical zone of clay-gyttja, whereas in cores 1 and 2 Zone IV covered the entire
thickness of this deposit. Secondly, there is the overwhelming dominance of Pinus in these
early zones, contrasted with the same zones in the marginal profiles, where Pinus occurs in
roughly the same (or somewhat smaller) proportions to the other trees as at corresponding
levels in pollen diagrams from the rest of England (Godwin 19406). In immediately post-
glacial times, therefore, deposition must have been much more rapid at the margins
(3 m.) than in water 7 to 10 m. deep, and the deposit in the more central position was clay-
gyttja throughout the period until the Boreal-Atlantic transition, whereas at the margin
this facies developed only in Zone IV, being followed by detritus gyttja in Zones
V and VI.
