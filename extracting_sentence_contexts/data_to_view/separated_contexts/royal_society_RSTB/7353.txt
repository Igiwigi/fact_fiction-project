However,
many lobules remain collapsed, and the whole picture is so varied that quantitative esti-
mates can only be made in those parts where reasonably uniform conditions are present. Results for the post-natal period are shown in table 26. By 48 hr., in spite of the fact that lung volume has increased, the number of intersections
is of the same order as the figure at term. By 5 days it is exceeded and more so by the 10th
day. When it is remembered that lung volume was increased by a factor of almost 2 at 48 hr.,
by 3-2 at 5 days and by 5 at the 10th day, it is obvious that considerable new formation of
septa is taking place.
