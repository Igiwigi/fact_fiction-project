Now we have shown above that —«, is the common angular velocity of the pair of
proper planes, and the above results show that it is in fact the luni-solar precession,

k,—«; is the angular velocity of the two nodes on their proper planes, and ib is
nearly equal to Nt. The ratio of the amplitude of the 19-yearly nutation to the inclination of the lunar
orbit is I/n. The ratio of the inclination of the lunar proper plane to the obliquity of the ecliptic
is ml/n.
