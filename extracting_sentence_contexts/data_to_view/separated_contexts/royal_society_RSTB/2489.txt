It seems
obvious that no comparison is valid between the pith of Osmunda and the apparent
pith which may sometimes occur in P. aurewm, for the former is extrastelar, whereas
the latter is intrastelar, and in direct continuity, according to LecLerc pu SaBion’s
own account, with the parenchyma of the internal phloem. In any case it seems
inadvisable to erect a stelar hypothesis on a peculiarity of a single species of Poly-
podium which has not yet been matched, either in additional species of the same,
or any other Polypodiaceous genus, especially as this feature does not appear to be
constant even in P. aureum itself. I have examined young plants of the following Polypodiaceous species :—Nephro-
lepis cordata, Microlepia hispida, Onychium japonicum, Polystichum  setosum,
Lastrea opaca, Davallia plumosa, Nephrodium hirtipes, Platyloma falcata, Blech-
num occidentale, Lomaria ciliata, Gymnogramme sulphurea, and species of Pteris,
Adiantum, Pellea, Aspidium, and Asplenium, without finding anything to record

beyond the fact that the young central cylinder in these species is throughout a
concentric fibro-vascular tube with foliar lacunze. Photograph 35, Plate 5, represents the tubular stele of Antrophyum semicostatum. The gap in the central cylinder is subtended by two concentric leaf-traces.
