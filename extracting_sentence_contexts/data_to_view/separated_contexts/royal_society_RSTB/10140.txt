The perceptual crossing task is anything but simple. It is only after the performance has been explained that it
appears so. In fact, described in strict computational terms,
it is a highly ambiguous, type II problem [41], i.e. a problem
where stimuli must be actively discriminated spatially and
qualitatively using only temporal and proprioceptive cues
(all ‘objects’ found in the virtual space produce the exact
same on-off tactile stimulation). The task set to the partici-
pants is no less complex than typical discrimination tasks. In fact, it is untypically difficult, because the two moving
objects that the participant can encounter (the other partici-
pant’s sensor and shadow) move identically.
