Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter the construction phase. The next-generation PTF
is a project to fill the Palomar Schmidt focal plane with charge-coupled devices to create a 30-40
square degree field of view (FoV). Pan-STARRS-2 has entered construction, which will give a
pair of sensitive 7 square degree FoV cameras on 1.8 m telescopes. These three projects have the
potential to provide the optical follow-up to gravitational wave and gamma-ray sources, giving a
powerful combination that could detect gravitational waves and quantify their sources. This has
potential implications far beyond astronomy, and will test fundamental physics if these sources
can be found and measured.

The second priority was the discovery and characterization of high-redshift GRBs. The
immense luminosity of GRBs has allowed their detection at z ~ 9, but this requires rapid near-
infrared follow-up to Swift triggers and further rapid response from the largest telescopes. The
fact that they can be used as beacons to probe the intervening intergalactic medium and also locate
the first galaxies means that this type of transient science has exciting potential for early Universe
studies. This meeting highlighted the importance to have combined facilities of a gamma-ray
burst monitor (Swift and SVOM are the only two missions currently working or funded), a suite


of 4m near-infrared telescopes for rapid response (and filtering the J+H band drop out afterglows)
and access to 20-40 m telescopes (European Extremely Large Telescope, Thirty Meter Telescope,
Giant Magellan Telescope) at the same time. While all of these facilities either exist, or are likely to
exist at some time in the future, this group foresees challenges in them existing at the same time
and working coherently together with large collaborations.

Discussions among the teams and in the plenary session also led to a conclusion that a
