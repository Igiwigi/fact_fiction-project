The fact that in this and in other 8imilar experiments it is possible to excite the
leaf once, twice, or a greater number of times without any appreciable movement of
the image, ab first sight seems to indicate that the electrical effect is independent of
the mechanical. But before accepting such an inference it must be remembered that
we cannob be at all sure that the interstitial movement of liquid, which in the leaf as in
all the moving organs of plants is the efficient cause of change of form, may not
begin without making itself visible by any change in the curvature of the lobe, how-

ever delicate our means of observation may be. It appears to me probable that every
effectual excitation—every excitation which is marked by electrical disturbance—is also
followed by diminution of the water-charge of the excited protoplagm.
