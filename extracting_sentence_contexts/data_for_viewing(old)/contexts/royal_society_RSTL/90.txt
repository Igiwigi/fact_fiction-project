Body of a Polypus forms only one Pipe, a ſort of Gur,
or Pouch.

I have bcen able to turn that Pouch, that Body of
the Polypus, inſide-outwards; as one may turn a Stoc-
king,

I haye ſeyeral by me, that haye remained turned in
this manner; their Inſide is become their Outſide,
and their Outſide their Inſide : They cat, they grow,
and they multiply, as if they had neyer been turned.

Facts like theſe I have related, to be admitted, re-
quire the moſt convincing Proofs, I yenture to fay,
I am able to produce ſuch Proofs,

They ariſe from the Detail of my Experiments, from
the Precautions I have taken to ayoid all Uncertainties,
from the Care I haye uſed to repeat the ſame Experi-
ment ſeyeral times, from the Aſliduity and Attention
with which I have obſerved them.

All this would require a Diſcuſſion too long to be
here related.
