On the cause of the colours with which the images are
affected. As there are some specimens of calcareous spar in which the
multiplication of the images is not accompanied with the pro-
duction of colours, the one phenomenon is not necessarily con-
nected with the other, the multiplication of the images depend-
ing merely on the interruption in the regular structure'of the
mineral, and the colours upon the thickness and erystalline
nature of the vein by which that interruption is produced. We have already seen that the double image Ab (Fig. s.)
is in-general white, while a, and B, are affected with the same
prismatic colour, and that when Ab is coloured at particular
angles of -incidence, its colour'is always complementary to

but. there is obviously a particular angle of, reflection at which four pencils are not
formed.

that of a'and B. \ These colours are therefore produced by
the transmission of polarised light through the crystallized
film AB, Fig. 4. The light is first| polarised by the prism
ABE: it is then separated into-its complementary colours; by
the crystallized film AB, and this compound heam is analyzed
by the second prism ABF. This arrangement, indeed, is.the
very same as that which I have described-in a former paper,*
as necessary for the exhibition of the complementary colours,
the light being - polarised by double refraction instead. of by
reflection, and being analyzed by a prism of calcareous spar,
instead of a plate of agate.
