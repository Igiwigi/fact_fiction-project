Nitrogen compared with the seed, to plants at the time in a precisely similar
dition to those now under consideration, the increase in the rapidity of growth was
marked.

Moxt of the buckwheat seed sown came up; but about half of the plants lived for onl;
a few days. The remainder, which survived, went through all the stages of 4
ment to flowering; but the entire amount of growth was on a very limited scale.

Reference to the last column of Table XII. will show that, under the conditions of
growth above described, the buckwheat, like the plants already discussed, indicated
no gain of Nitrogen. In fact there appeared to be a loss in the experiment of nearly
2 milligrammes of Nitrogen ; and that the result should be to a small extent in this
direction may, perhaps, be accounted for by the fact of some of the plants dying early,
in consequence of which there may have been a slight evolution of free Nitrogen due

to decomposition.

Bearing of the above rexults on the question of the evolution of free Nitrogen from the
Nitrogenous Constituents of plants during growth.

We have thus far only considered the aboye results 80 far as they bear upon the
question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants. But from the constancy of the
amount of combined Nitrogen maintained in relation to that supplied, throughout the
experiments, they afford evidence of an important kind in regard to the conyerse
question of whether plants give off free Nitrogen during growth. With no less force
