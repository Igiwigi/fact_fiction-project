It is
interesting to see that the correlation between the ovules and either ripe or aborted
seeds is not very high. A large number of ovules not necessarily connoting either
a very large number of ripe or of aborted seeds. In fact, in the case of the ever-
lasting pea, the number of ovules has very small influence indeed on the number
of seeds which ripen. In the tare vetch only is the relationship more marked,
Professor F. O. Onrver tells me that in certain cases evolution appears to be tending
in the direction of the pod containing one ripe seed only. It seems, therefore, that
such relations as are indicated in Table LI.
