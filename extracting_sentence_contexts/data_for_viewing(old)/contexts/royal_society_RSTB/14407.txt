tent has even been suggested as a key driver for the successful regulation of
larger social groups in early hominins and to have facilitated the emergence
of conventional language [3,7—10]. However, a growing body of research chal-
lenges this view, with evidence to suggest that animal emotion expressions can
also be produced in strategic and flexible ways and be voluntarily controlled, at
least to a certain extent [6,7,11]. In fact, the view that emotion expressions in
non-human animals are involuntary read-outs of internal states is invalidated
a priori by philosophical accounts that discuss emotion expressions under the
logic of evolutionary theories on communication [12].

The communication of distress may be a context where strategic emotion
signalling is especially important. In human toddlers for instance, producing
distress signals often results in emotional engagement of carers, including the
offering of consolation, a form of empathic comforting [13]. Consolation is
not only important for alleviating the signaller’s distress, but it can also serve
other functions too, including strengthening of social bonds [14,15]. Given its
