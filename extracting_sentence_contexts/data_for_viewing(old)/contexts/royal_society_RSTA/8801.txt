The other example is that of Greenore Point. In this case « is negative, we should
therefore expect the effect of the coast line to be to make the time of H.W. earlier
on the north side of the cape than on the southern side.

This effect might. if it were sutticiently great, reverse the direction of travel of the
co-tidal line in the neighbourhood of the point. As a matter of fact the effect
is great enough to do this. It is H.W. at Saltees, some 10 miles 8.W. of Carnsore
Point, at 6h. 6m. At Carnsore Point, 4 miles 8. of Greenore Point, it is H.W. at
6h. 25m. At Tuskar Rock, 4 miles out from Greenore Point, it is H.W. at 6h. 10m.
At Wexford South Bay, on the north side of the Point, it is H.W. at 6h. 5m. After
that the time of H.W. gets later as one goes further northwards up the coast. It
will be seen that from Carnsore Point to Wexford South Bay, therefore, the direction
of travel of the co-tidal line is just reversed. The fact that H.W. at Wexford South
Bay, which is well round Greenore Point, is actually earlier than H.W. at Tuskar
Rock which is south of Greenore Point, besides being 4 miles out at sea, is remark-
able. I do not know whether any explanation has been offered before of how it is
that the effect of a cape on the tidal phenomena in its neighbourhood is so very
different in different parts of the sea.

Summary of Conelusions. (Added October 24, 1919.)

The rate of dissipation of energy at spring tides in the Irish Sea is calculated from
the known formule for skin-friction of the wind on the ground and the friction of
rivers on their beds. The results range from 1040 to 1300 ergs per square centimetre
per second. The least of these is 150 times as great as Mr. SrREeEt’s previous
