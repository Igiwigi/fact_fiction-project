A pragmatist could insist that the purpose of the periodic table lies : =
in teaching and explaining chemical phenomena and that the current 18-column format serves : =
those purposes well. In the present article, we prefer to take a more philosophical approach. 1B
The discovery of the periodic system represents one of the major achievements in all of modern : =
science. The periodic table is of course an attempt to provide a visual representation of the DR
periodic system, namely the fact that elements recur in an approximate fashion after certain : o
intervals. From this holistic or global perspective, it makes sense to want to emphasize the unity 8
of the periodic system and to treat all of the elements on an equal footing, rather than retaining : ยง
the separation of the f-block elements that is a historical hangover from the time when it was not : S
clear how these elements should be regarded (Mendeleev and the other pioneers of the periodic 7S

table had great difficulty in accommodating the rare earth elements which form a large fraction
of the f-block. Mendeleev is known to have given up this task to his colleague Brauner (see [11]).
