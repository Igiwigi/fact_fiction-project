Concerning scalar metric fluctuations, a steep and growing primordial spectrum is in obvious
conflict with present data, and has to be efficiently suppressed at all (large) scales relevant to
the present CMB observations. This is possible, provided the parameters controlling the cosmic
pre-big bang dynamics satisfy appropriate constraints [34]. In addition, an appropriate (slightly
red) spectrum of adiabatic curvature perturbations, responsible for the observed CMB anisotropy,
has to be efficiently produced through the axion-curvaton mechanism [30-33]. This also can
be obtained for a restricted class of pre-big bang backgrounds [25-27,34], and the restrictions
imposed to match the observed spectral behaviour can break the perfect duality symmetry of the
whole cosmological scenario.

Even imposing such constraints (and thus obtaining scalar perturbations compatible with
observational data), we are left with tensor perturbations whose properties are somewhat
‘anomalous’ with respect to those of the standard inflationary scenario. In fact, their amplification
during the pre-big bang phase leads to the production of a primordial stochastic background of
relic gravitational waves peaking at high frequency (typically, in the GHz range), and with a large,
possibly detectable intensity in the sensitivity band of present (or near-future) interferometric
antennas (see e.g. [34,58] for a recent discussion). The spectral properties of these cosmic gravitons
are uniquely and directly correlated to the kinematic behaviour of the gravi-dilaton background
in the primordial pre-big bang regime. Their detection would thus provide direct (and unique)



information on the possible dual symmetry of our Universe, and/or on its possible degree of
breaking.
