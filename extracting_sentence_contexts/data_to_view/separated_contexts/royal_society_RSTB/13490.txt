Simple technologies such as cutting
stone tools, for instance, exploit the effect of hard and sharp edges to slice
through softer materials. Other technologies such as wheels harness the effect
of rolling to facilitate movement by reducing friction. There is nothing particularly remarkable about the fact that human cultural
evolution exploits natural phenomena. Products of biological evolution also
exploit natural phenomena. The teeth of carnivores are hard and sharp to cut
through flesh, the structure of down feathers traps air to limit heat loss from
birdsâ€™ body, and so on.
