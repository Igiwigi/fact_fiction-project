sites only, and do not of necessity represent fairly the crop of the whole country ;
the geographical position of a plot, its date of sowing, spatial allowance, dates of
irrigation, etc., may all be important, but in order to avoid encumbrance with these
details, most of them have been confined to the Appendix. Of course, the ideal
method would have been to obtain data from a number of permanent Observation
Stations, so scattered over the country as to provide a fair sample of the whole, and
preferably subjected to the ordinary cultivation and irrigation régime of the site
and season. It should also be remembered that for our present critical purpose no
data of non-analysed yield are of any use.

It might be thought that such an analysis as we propose to make would be
hampered by “ seasonal factors,” so it is perhaps worth while at the outset to call
the reader’s attention to the fact that there is no seasonal factor left, as such, on
the completion of our analysis. Certain peculiarities of any one season may leave an
impress on the crop; of such are a late or early flood, or a hot day in the spring,
but these are not “seasonal” in any vague sense.

It remains to outline the method of treatment given to the data in this present-
ment. The logical method would be to take factor by factor and discuss the opera-
tion of each one separately. Reference to the Appendix will show that such
treatment would be much too lengthy. The converse method has therefore been
adopted, by classifying the data and making a factorial analysis of them; thus we
have dealt with the various causes which may influence the rise of the flowering-
curve by bringing together all our data on this matter, and then showing how the
date and rate of the rise have been controlled by soil-temperature, soil-fertility,
