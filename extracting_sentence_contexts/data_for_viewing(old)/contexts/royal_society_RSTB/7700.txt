between 36 and 46°C. The first flights by individual swarm members appear in the morning
at body temperatures within and below Hussein’s range of ‘normal activity’, as Gunn etal.
(1948, pp. 16 and 39) have shown. The taking-off observed at that time is by numerous,
separate individuals scattered throughout the swarm (p. 169), and it is most unlikely that
the temperature threshold for it is much lowered by mutual stimulation. Stimulation of one
individual by others soon takes a hand, but is not a primary or a necessary condition for
repeated taking-off.

Mass flight cannot be regarded as spontaneous in the sense that isolated flights are,
owing to the occurrence of mutual stimulation, and observations of isolated gregaria locusts
starting on migration have not yet been recorded. Hence it is at present impossible to say
at what temperature migration would start without the aid of mutual stimulation. Possibly
the required temperature would be higher than for swarm migration. But the fact remains
that Volkonsky (1939) found that the threshold body temperature for mass taking-off by
locusts in a large cage varied between 31 and 37° C, and Gunn et al. (1948) found that the
highest body temperatures recorded at stream-away in the field varied between 27 and
41°C on different occasions. That is to say the start of mass migration often occurs
when the locusts’ body temperatures are well within Hussein’s range for normal activity.
Waloff’s (1946) finding that the flight activity of Desert Locust swarms in East Africa
remained at a high level as long as the average maximum temperature was above 20 to 22° C
(cp. Predtechensky, 1935) was strikingly paralleled by the finding of Gunn et al. that mass
departure occurred at air temperatures between 17 and 23° C.

Mass migration is not caused, therefore, by excessive temperatures. On the contrary,
Volkonsky (1939) found that his caged swarm ceased taking-off when body temperatures
