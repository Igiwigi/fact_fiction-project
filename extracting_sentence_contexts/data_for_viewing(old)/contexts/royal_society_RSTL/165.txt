pass across, the full effect was again produced. The reason of
this difference appears to be, that the quicker evaporation in-
creases the degree of cold, and the current brings greater dif-
ferences of density contiguous.

This 5tate of rapid evaporation will fully account for the
phenomenon witnessed by Mr. Latyam, who has described
(in the Phil. Trans. for 1796, p. 957) an extraordinary eleva-
tion of the opposite coast of France, 8 as to be seen fronr the
beach at Hastings, and other parts of Sussex.

There is a fact of the same kind stated by De La LanDE,
(Astron. Tom. II.) who says that the mountains of Corsica
(though at the distance of more than 100 miles) are occa-
Sionally visible from Genoa.

It is probably owing to the same cause, that other objects
have been sometimes seen, at such distances that we should
expect them to be intercepted by the curvature of the earth ;
for it is evident, that whensoever the evaporation over each mile
of surface occasions a refraction of about x minute, the rays
receive a curvature equal to that of the ocean, so that its sur-
face will appear flat, and the spherical form of the earth will
not obstruct horizontal vision of objects at any distance.
