at 63, 64, 69, 76; consequently, the representation of flexion is anterior to that of
extension. It will be seen that the hallux is at the highest point (7.e., nearest: the
middle line) of the area only associated with the ankle and other toes, (Vide infra.)

(24) Movements of the Small Toes.—-The small toes were represented at 54, 63, 64,
69; 70, 71,76, 77,75; LOO, 110,

At squares Nos. 109, 110, which were situated on the anterior frontier of the lower
limb area, we obtained the unique movement of very slight extension of the second
toe, which is homologous with the index finger.

The primary movement of the small toes occurred on exciting squares Nos. 70, 71,
54, 78, No. 70 being the point of intensest representation ; in fact, at 70 and 71 the
small toes were the only segments which moved at all. See fig. 24, Plate 20.

Character of Movement —This was in all cases extension. See also “ Marches,”
p- 143.

(25) Movements of all Toes.—All the toes moved in synchronous association at
squares 63, 64, 69, 76, the movement being invariably extension with separation of
the digits. See also “ Marches,” p. 143. :

(26) Movements of the Ankle.—The total of absolute representation of movements of
the ankle is situated at squares 54, 55, 56, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 76, 77.
