features. In Psummobia pallida there is a much more copious proliferation of sub-
filamentar tissue, tending to choke up the interior of the plica, than in the other
species, There is a fair amount of muscle fibre around the interlamellar spaces and
in the interlamellar septa in Psammobia vespertina.

The principal filament of Psammobia ferroensis bears a false resemblance to a
couple of ordinary filaments (see fig. 38), due to the sharply-cut sides of the frontal

filament. The illusion is dispelled, however, on examining sections near the ventral

edge of the demibranch, since here the groove becomes less and less pronounced, and
finally disappears. The appearance presented in fig. 839A may sometimes be seen,
owing to the frontal groove disappearing on one side before the other. Apart from
this, the fallacy may be exposed by a eritical examination of the cilia of the principal
filaments (fig. 38).

In Psammobia ferroensis the sides of the principal filament slope away abruptly
from the edges of the groove, but in Psammobia vesperting (fig. 39B) and Psam-
