also of ciliary motion, and that it, too, is to be regarded as directly depending upon
a conversion of vital force into mechanical motion. The continuance of motion in
the cilia appears to be intimately related to changes taking place in the cells on which
they are borne; and its persistence after the detachment of these cells from the re-
mainder of the body, like the persistence in the contractility of muscular fibre which
has been completely isolated from all its connections, proves that we must look to
forces existing in them, and not to influences derived from any other source, for the
maintenance of this curious operation.

Passing from these particular manifestations of vital force, which s0 remarkably
indicate its relations to physical agencies, to those which, being concerned in the
development and growth of organized structures, seem to have less in common with
them, we shall fix our attention on the fundamental fact, that these Organizing forces
(as we may conveniently designate them) are s0 completely dependent upon the con-
tinual agency of Heat (and in some cases of Light also), that they may be considered
as the manifestations of the action of heat upon organized fabrics.

The necessity for this agency may be seen at every period of the life of organized
beings of all kinds. In the lower tribes of animals, and in the entire vegetable king-
dom, we trace this dependence in the precise relation between the vital activity of each
individual, and the amount of heat which it receives from external sources. Every spe-
cies is adapted to flourish within a certain range of temperature; and that amount
of heat which is most effective in sustaining the life of one species, may be injurious
or even fatal to another. But within the range which is compatible with the mani-
festation of its vital powers, we find that the relation is most constant between the
