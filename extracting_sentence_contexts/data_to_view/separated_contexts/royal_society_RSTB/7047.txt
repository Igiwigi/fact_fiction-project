The size and configuration of the stele, in fact, are directly related to the
size of the apical meristem and the latter to the nutritional status of the tissues with which
it is in organic continuity (Wardlaw 1945). A comprehensive study of pteridophytes has shown that the progressive elaboration of
the stele accompanies its increase in size. That there is such a size-structure correlation
may now be accepted as a fact (Bower 1921, 1930; Wardlaw 1947d). The initial differentiation
of vascular tissue immediately below the apical meristem is a process which apparently
takes place uniformly throughout development, from the young sporophyte to the adult
state; it is during the subsequent phase of development and differentiation that the various elabora-
tions of the stele take place. These can be directly correlated with the size and nutritional
status of the apical and subapical regions.
