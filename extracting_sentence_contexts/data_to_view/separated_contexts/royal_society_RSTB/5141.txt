That is, so far as these data are concerned, decrease in the size of the
leaf tends to be accompanied by a decrease, instead of an increase, in the number of
stomata, and vice-versa. As, however, the correlation coefficient is only -}- 0-074,
which is less than the probable error, no importance can be attached to this feature. The fact that there is no “ significant ” correlation is, however, to be emphasised, as
despite the comparatively small number of leaves examined, viz., 26, the contrast with
Statice binervosa (30 leaves) is so marked. The Ficaria leaves were obtained from eight
different plants, grown under uniform, conditions as to soil and in a moist atmosphere,
four being well illuminated and the other four in shade. It would, therefore, seem, that
the relation between leaf size and stomatal frequency, which is so pronounced when we
compare leaves of the same node, may be entirely masked under humid conditions.
