A slight
enlargement can be detected even in the second cell from the host cell, as the third,
of which only a small portion is depicted, lies at the level of the surface of the
tumour. The width of the outer wall of the host cell represents the original width
of the cell when infection took place. On the left-hand side there are no rosette
cells, and the wall of the host cell is straight, the explanation of both these relations
lying in the fact that the adjacent cell on that side has also been infected ; for it
has invariably been found that when two infected cells adjoin, the common wall is
kept straight by mutual pressure and the two organisms share the one rosette. Should a single uninfected cell intervene, however, its presence is sufficient to ensure

the formation of an individual rosette for each host cell. The host cell figured

has probably reached its full size, but the prosorus will continue to enlarge until it
fills the lower portion of the cell (fig. 13).
