Mendeleev’s construction of the periodic table; it still
Goldhammer—Herzfeld criterion, represents the cornerstone of our view of modern
Mott criterion chemistry. In this contribution, a particular emphasis
will be attached to the question ‘Why do the
A . chemical elements of the periodic table exist either
uthor for correspondence: : “as
as metals or non-metals under ambient conditions?’
Peter P Edwards This is perhaps most apparent in the p-block of the
e-mail: peter.edwards@chem.ox.ac.uk periodic table where one sees an almost-diagonal line
separating metals and non-metals. The first searching,
quantum-mechanical considerations of this question
were put forward by Hund in 1934. Interestingly, the
very first discussion of the problem—in fact, a pre-
quantum-mechanical approach—was made earlier, by
Goldhammer in 1913 and Herzfeld in 1927. Their
simple rationalization, in terms of atomic properties
which confer metallic or non-metallic status to
elements across the periodic table, leads to what is
commonly called the Goldhammer—Herzfeld criterion
for metallization. For a variety of undoubtedly
complex reasons, the Goldhammer-Herzfeld theory
