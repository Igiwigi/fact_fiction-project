There are,
however, plausibly still reasons to doubt the model, in part because of the level of background
theory mediation and the lack of empirical access to photonic phenomena in the interior of stars. The final piece of evidence, that we take to establish the model as empirically viable in
its domain beyond reasonable doubt, involves a means of gaining access to non-photonic
phenomena in the interior of stars. However, once more, crucially this evidence is only in fact
able to support the model when combined with terrestrial experiments, and so is naturally
underpinned by uniformity principles. We have made a point so far of the fact that obtaining
direct photonic observational evidence of the nuclear reactions in stellar cores is not possible. However, on account of the fact that the neutrinos produced in the nuclear reactions in the
stellar core interact so weakly with matter, it is highly probable for them to escape the star
without interacting, allowing us to detect on Earth stellar neutrinos directly from the stellar
core.
