some facts in the anatomy of the Mollusca which have hitherto been unknown or
neglected.

With these views I propose to treat—-1, of the nervous system ; 2, of the vascular
system ; 3, of certain portions of the alimentary system ; and 4, of the renal system.

I. Nervous System.—The nervous system of every Mollusk consists of two great
systems ;—A. an excito-motor, or sensory and yolitional system ; B. a visceral or
sympathetic system. The former consists of three pairs of primary ganglia, which
always exist, and of a variable number of accessory local ganglia, which may or may
not exist*,

* The first record I can find of the distinct enunciation of this very important anatomical fact, is in M, Sov-
LEYET'S es8ay on the Pteropoda (Observations Anatomiques, Physiologiques et Zoologiques sur les Mollusques
Pteropodes), of which an abstract is given in the Comptes Rendus for 1843 : he says,—* The central neryous
system of the Mollusca is essentially composed of the three orders of ganglia which I have just pointed out
(orders answering exactly to those mentioned in the text), and it is in fact reduced to these ganglia in a
certain number of animals of this type. But in others the nerves which are given off present numerous enlarge-
ments in their course, and this tendency to a ganglionic disposition is $0 decided among the highest Mollusks,
that all the nerves emanating from the central medullary masses produce new ganglia in the parts to which
they are distributed” (p. 667).

Again :—* From the facts which have just been stated summarily, T believe I may conclude, —

*1. That the exclusive analogy which many naturalists have wished to establish between the nervous system
