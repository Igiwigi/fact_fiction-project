although he used the utmost expedition, being, in fact, closely
pursued by the Carthaginian fleet. The place where he landed
was called Azrepizs, the Quarries; whence he proceeded to
the neighbouring cities of Meyaay Tia, Megalapolis, or the
Great City, and Aevzo» Tore, White Tunis. The position of
