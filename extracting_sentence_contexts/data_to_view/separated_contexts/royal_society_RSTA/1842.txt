However, it is suggested that the observed
differences in catalytic selectivity are not significant. It is possible, given the relatively high flow
rates used within this study, that the plateau observed in H2O2 concentration can be related to
limitations associated with reactant gas diffusion to the catalyst. Alternatively, it is also possible
that as the liquid and gas flow rates were held constant during these experiments and in turn
residence time across the catalyst bed is modified (electronic supplementary material, table S.2)
that in fact H2O2 synthesis and degradation rates are equivalent, resulting in a plateauing of
observable HO, concentration. Regardless, selectivity towards H2O, is seen to remain high,
exceeding 85%. The effect of total reaction pressure was next investigated (figure 4), while maintaining all
other reaction conditions.
