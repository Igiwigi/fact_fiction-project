At present, therefore, there is no theory
which accounts satisfactorily for the observed facts. The widespread fields of positive
anomalies indicate excess mass, but whether this is supported by the static strength of the
crust or by a dynamical process, such as convection currents, is still an open question. The
latter hypothesis appears to be the more attractive, since the assumption of a semi-plastic
substratum provides a simple explanation of the fact that the sediments which form the
outer margin of the continental shelf are very nearly in isostatic equilibrium. The evidence
for this will be considered in the next section.

This profile comprises stations nos. 4 to 16 and 50 and extends a distance of some 500
miles west-south-west from the Lizard.
