This matches empirical evidence from mul-
tiple supergene systems, where combinations of different

selective pressures are involved in the maintenance of
polymorphism [3,4,55,63,64]. In our simulations, balanced lethals only evolved under
restrictive conditions. This finding is in good qualitative
agreement with the fact that, despite a broad representation
across the tree of life, balanced lethal systems appear to be
quite rare [10]. All documented balanced lethal systems are
supergenes [12,15,16,59,60] but none of them has yet been
studied at the genomic level. With the advent of next gener-
ation sequencing, properties associated with the evolution of
balanced lethal systems can be investigated empirically.
