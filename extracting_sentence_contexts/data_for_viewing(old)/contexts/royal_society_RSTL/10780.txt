The above experiments give no indication of a continuous change in the surface
tension as the film becomes thinner. The differences observed are irregular and sueh
as would arise from accidental causes.

Thus, in Experiment VIL., the black film showed a deficiency of surface tension of
0-41 per cent. when balanced against a film which displayed the blue and green of the
8econd order. In Experiment IX. the surface tension of the black film, also balanced
against another, which showed the blue of the second order, was in excess by 1'5 per
cent. r

In all cases where the same experiment has furnished two results they make dT of
opposite 8igns, thereby indicating that the difference between the two films is not due
to the fact that one is thicker than the other.

"The results are summed up in the following table â€”
