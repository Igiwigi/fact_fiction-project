(G) The Isolation of the Particular Region Observed.

Ste i is, in our opinion, an essential condition for the accurate employment of any
Wthod of localisation which relies upon the evidence of electrical changes in a given
ion, that the region in question should be as far as possible isolated. In the
xavanometric experiments alluded to in the History (p. 279), as carried out upon the
Ã©tebral hemispheres, such isolation was not affected; a door was thus left open for
wBroduction of errors which it is not easy to control.
BWe have repeatedly had occasion to observe that when a pair of non-polarisable
Iectrodes is placed upon the cord lying in situ, or upon the surface of the exposed
Bin (see fig. 26, Chapter XI.) electrical differences present themselves and influence
Re galvanometer, this being evidently due to the fact that the parts with which the
tacts are made, since they form one directly continuous mass with the structures
und them, lie in the path of the derivations of currents, whose primary electro-
tive source is far removed from the electrodes.
a this connection we may refer to the derivations of the electrical difference
between the different regions of the beating* heart which are present in the body.

On connecting two points on the surface of the exposed brain by means of non-
polarisable electrodes with the galvanometer, any reflex movement of the scalp muscles
lying outside the exposed region was found to evoke electrical changes in the points
of contact, and if structures so far removed from the seat of observation can affect the
contacts, how much more easily will these be affected by sources of electromotive differ-
ences situated in the deeper fibres, &., of the brain. The fact that electrical
