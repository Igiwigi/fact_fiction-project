So far as my own observations have gone at present, I find that amongst the Anguilla
tide this remarkable tenacity of life of which we have been speaking, is met with onl
amongst the representatives of four land and freshwater genera, Tylenchus, Plectul
Aphelenchus, and Cephalobus ; whilst those of all the other genera excepting Rhabditd
marine as well as land and freshwater, are rather remarkable for the very opposll
characteristic, they being incapable of recovery even after the shortest periods of desi
cation*, Very many of the species of these four genera are found in earth, lich
moss, or other situations in which they are exposed to constant vicissitudes of drough
and moisture according to ever changing meteorological conditions, and in the possel
Son of this power of resisting the effects of desiccation they exhibit the most admi
rable adaptation for neutralizing what would otherwise be the fatal influence of tht
varying condition of their environment. Their whole life-history must be a strang
one, made up of periods of life and activity alternating with others of potential deal

altogether inconstant and variable, and sueceeding one another under the influence 0

almost a matter of chance. Doubtless they have a certain definite 8pan of active eaxistence,
in which to go through the stages of development and growth, and provide for the cone
