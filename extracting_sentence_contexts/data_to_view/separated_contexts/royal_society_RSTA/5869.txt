has to be computed. In fact, for the PSB3 molecule, the KEO calculation on the grid of ce, is

about 1800 times faster than the calculation of fe . The analysis of the variations of the metric tensor components allows us to propose [28]: (i) a
constant metric tensor, GConst, Which is obtained from an average of the constrained metric tensor,
ct, over 45 geometries and includes only the symmetric components, whose values are given
in table 1; (ii) a diagonal constant metric tensor, Gpiag-Const, in which G™sHOOP js set to zero. To further assess the influence of these approximations, exact quantum dynamics simulations
were performed with the three metric tensors, namely Gpiag-Const, the constrained metric tensor
ream and the one extracted from the exact metric tensor, Gt).
