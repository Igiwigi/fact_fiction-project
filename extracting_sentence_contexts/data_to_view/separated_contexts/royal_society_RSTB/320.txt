Summary of Results obtained by the Study of Degeneration following Lesions of the
Motor Cortical Area,

Removal of the grey matter of the motor area of the brain, exclusive of the
marginal gyrus, produces degeneration which becomes collected in the internal
capsule, and thence downwards follows a regular and definite course as has already
been abundantly shown by previous observers. Diagram 1,

POSTERIOR ANTERIOR

Horizontal section through one hemisphere showing the position of degeneration in the internal capsule
following removal of the external motor surface (exclusive of gyrus marginalis),

In the internal capsule, as seen in a horizontal section, it occupies the middle third
extending farther behind the knee than in front (diagr. 1), but quite distinct for a short
distance in front of the knee, The degeneration does not involve the whole breadth
of the internal capsule, but leaves the inner border almost entirely free.

* For an account of the symptoms observed during life and the exact extent of cerebral surface
removed, see “ A Record of Experiments upon the Functions of the Cerebral Cortex,” loc, cit., Cases 15,
16, 17, and 18. OF THE GYRUS MARGINALIS AND GYRUS FORNICATUS IN MONKEYS. 351

The part of the capsule along the inner border is occupied by the fibres from the
gyrus marginalis (diagr. 2), as is proved by the fact that when the entire motor
area (including the gyrus marginalis) is removed, the whole width of the internal
capsule is degenerated (diagr. 3), although the inner border never appears so
completely degenerated as the outer. Diagram 2. Horizontal section through one hemisphere showing the position of degeneration following
removal of the gyrus marginalis.
