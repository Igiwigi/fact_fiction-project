For interesting details on this subject, and also on the influence
fSolutions of yarious poisonous and narcotic alkaloids, I must refer to M. Davainr's
rSresting memoir, He also dwells upon what I am able to confirm, viz., the fact that
h&-remarkable powers possessed by the young are not shared by the adult Tylenchus
ici, which does not exhibit any very well-marked tenacity of life. As I shall point
= afterwards, however, this is quite exceptional, and is in all probability due to the
iGthod of existence of this animal, since in other species of the genus Zylenchus both
I; and young are similarly endowed in this respect. Elsewhere* M. Davaixg having
ome aware of the fact that all the Anguillulide do not possess this same tenacity of

Ethinks that those species which are constantly submerged do not possess this pro

a the right direction, it is, however, too sweeping a generalization,

The experiments which were conducted in concert by MM. Dovtrt and GAVARRED
pon the degree of tenacity of life of the Rotifere and Anguillulide found in tufts of
