The former he found to be
grey-green, the latter a dirty (ﬆhmutzig) brown, This, indeed, represents not unfairly
the general difference in tint of the glands in the respective states when examined
with not too high a power. I should prefer to call the tint of the one yellow-brown
and that of the other brown-black, GriTzNER applied his description to the cells as
a whole; the yellow-brown tint is, however, in the main due to the staining of the cell-
granules, the brown-black tint in the main to the staining of the cell-protoplasm. It will be noticed that my views on the processes taking place during secretion are
opposed to the lately-advanced views of STRICKER and SPINA, and on the whole similar
to those of Hemexnais, The theory of STrRICKER and SPINAt is based upon 8ome
interesting facts observed by them in the glands of the web and nictitating membrane
of the Frog. The theory s0 deduced holds, they think, for all secretory glands ; they
attempt to show that it holds for the salivary glands,

I may be pardoned for not entering into a discussion of the question as long as the
objections raiged by Hepexnaixy} remain unanswered. T will only remark that in my
observations on serous and mucous salivary glands, on gastric and pancreatic glands,
and on the liver, I have seen nothing in favour of the theory of STrICKER and SPINA,
but many things against it.
