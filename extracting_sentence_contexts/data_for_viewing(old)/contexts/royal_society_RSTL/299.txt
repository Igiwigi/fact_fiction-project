by M. Gay Lvussac, with respect to the union of gases, and

the actual prevalence of that law of multiple proportions by
which the atomic theory is best supported, and it is in fact to
Mr. DaLTon that we are indebted for the first correct obser-
vation of such an instance of a simple multiple in'the union of
nitrous gas with oxygen. In his endeavours to determine'the
composition of the atmosphere, he found that the quantity of
oxygen contained in 100 measures of common air would com-
bine with either g6 or 72 measures of nitrous gas, according
to certain variations in the 'mode of conducting the experi-
ment.*

Chemists in general, however, appear to have been by no
means duly impressed with the importance of this observation
of Mr. DaLTox, till they were in possession of other facts
