509. The consideration of the yarious theories of electro-chemical decom-
position, whilst it has made me diffident, has also given me confidence to add
another to the number; for it is because the one I have to propose appears,
after the most attentive consideration, to explain and agree with the immense
collection of facts belonging to this branch of science, and to remain uncontra-
dicted by, or unopposed to, any of them, that I have been encouraged to give it.

510. Electro-chemical decomposition is well known to depend essentially
upon the current of electricity. I have shown that in certain cases (375.) the
decomposition is proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing, whatever
may be its intensity or its s0urce, and that the same is probably true for all
cases (377.), even when the utmost generality is taken on the one hand, and
great, precision of expression on the other,

511. In speaking of the current, I find myself obliged to be still more parti-
cular than on a former occasion (283.), in consequence of the yariety of views
taken by philosophers, all agreeing in the effect of the current itself. Some
