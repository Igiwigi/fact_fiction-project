cases there ought to be little or no variation in the difference between any two
of the pendulums : neither would there be if we could insure the making of
the experiments precisely under the same circumstances ; and no blame can

be attached to those zealous officers, surrounded as they must be with difli-
culties of every kind for carrying on snch delicate experiments. In fact,
amongst the multitude of experiments that I have myself made, I have seldom
found, after I had dismounted a pendulum, and then replaced it (even on the
same day, under all the fayourable circumstances of equality of temperature &.,
and with all the convyeniencies of manipulation,) that I could make it tell the
same 8tory in the next series of experiments. Eyen the same pendulum, furnished
with two different knife edges, rendered synchronous or nearly $0, similar to
those described in the above enumeration as convertible pendulums (No. 25â€”
38), where the trifling difference in the results of each pair of knife edges,
ought, after proper reductions, to be a constant quantity, will frequently differ
by an amount much greater than can be attributed to the errors of obser-
vation.
