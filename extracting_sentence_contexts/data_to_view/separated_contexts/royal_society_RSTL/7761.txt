Trans, 1824, I. p. 222),
in which he gives a graphic account of two attacks of © halt-blindness,” with an interval
of twenty years between them. On comparing his account with later descriptions, I think it will be recognized that
WorLLAastoNn, ARAGO, and BREWSTER are describing one form, while Sir Jonx HERSCHEL,
Sir CnarLes WHEATSTONE, the Astronomer Royal, and Professor DurouR, with myself,
are describing another (which had also been noticed by Dr. ForugRG1LL and Dr. PaRRy). The striking facts of gradual increase, motion, form, and colour which characterize the
records of the later group, could not have escaped the notice of the three earlier obseryers,
if present ; and we must conclude from their silence that these features were wanting or
at least were inconspicuous. In Dr. WoLLastoN's paper, the passage of chief importance for comparison with other
accounts is the following :—* This blindness was not 80 complete as to amount to abso-
lute blackness, but was a shaded darkness without definite outline. The complaint was
of short duration, and in about a quarter of an hour might be said to be wholly gone,
having receded with a gradual motion from the centre of vision obliquely upwards
towards the left.”
