Laplace inferred the same expression from theoretical considerations
based on the form of the undulatory theory accepted in his time. Jamin (1856, 18572),
as a result of experiments on water and its vapour, considered that the law did not
hold when a change of state occurred, and since his time it has come to be regarded
merely as an empirical approximation. Better agreement with the experimental facts is obtained with the empirical ex-
pression (1-2), which was propounded by Gladstone and Dale (1858, 1863) as the result
of experiments on water and carbon disulphide at different temperatures. Sutherland
(1889) has attempted to give a theoretical basis for this relation, though without much
success. The third relation is probably the most interesting both theoretically and practically.
