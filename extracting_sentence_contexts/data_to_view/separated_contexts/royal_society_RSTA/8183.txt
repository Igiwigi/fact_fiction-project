But we have
already pointed out that microseisms begin to make their appearance long before the
arrival of the monsoon current on the Malabar coast with rough seas. Storms also
invariably give rise to pronounced microseisms when they are in the mid-Arabian Sea
or in the centre of the Bay of Bengal. When due account is taken of the fact that equation (10) ‘is applicable only to the
superficial layer, the pressure disturbance at the bed of the sea can be obtained in two
stages. Assume that the motion due to the surface disturbance has become negligible
at the depth y = — h, where h is only a small fraction of d. Then if P, is the pressure
disturbance at this depth, equation (11) gives

Pi = ge (h +1).
