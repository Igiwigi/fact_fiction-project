Scholander termed this ability to redistribute blood flow to
vital organs the master switch of life, as it provides a defence
to asphyxia [59]. Although a key aspect of the dive response,
to date, to our knowledge, no field studies of blood flow or
blood pressure in diving animals have been undertaken
using biologgers. In fact, the only blood flow field study on a
diving animal was a study on penguins modelled after blood
flow telemetry studies on baboons and giraffes [60-62]. Millard
et al. [19] found blood flow reduction in the femoral artery was
much greater than in the carotid artery during voluntary dives
of tethered penguins. In 2007, a fully implantable telemetry
system for measuring blood flow and pressure was demon-
strated in alligators [63].
