It may be shown that in


such a case it is uniform for f in compact subsets of the open right half-axis (0,00). For singular
perturbation theorists, the reason for that is clear: there are initial (and possibly other) layers
involved here, and the convergence simply cannot be uniform around f = 0. In fact, quite often singular perturbation theorems have the form

Jim T,(t)x =T(t)Px, t>0,xeEX, (5.1)
ro1-

where {T(t), t = 0} is a strongly continuous semigroup on a subspace Xq of X and P is a projection
onto Xo (in the sense that P* = P and Px = x,x € Xo). To repeat, in this case, the classical theory
does not work and, in particular, condition

lim (A—A,)-1x=(4-B)-!Px, = xeX, (5.2)
rol

(where B is the generator of {T(f), t > 0}) for all (some) 4 > 0 is necessary but not sufficient for (5.1). Condition (5.2) may imply (5.1) provided that the semigroups involved possess additional
regularity properties (like uniform analyticity; see e.g. [4], Ch. 31 and 41 for details; the latter
condition can be for example efficiently checked if we are working in a Hilbert space and
the semigroups are related to forms, see [18]).
