of this is obvious; analytically it is merely an instance of a general fact, pointed ont
by Jacorr; namely, that the effect of two successive pseudo-differentiations with
respect to two independent variables, is not generally independent of the order of
operations. If V be the potential of another body, given in position, upon the body considered,
then V is a function of 0, @, , and
