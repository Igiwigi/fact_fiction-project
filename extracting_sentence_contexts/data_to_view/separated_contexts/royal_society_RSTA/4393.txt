Le nd 2—= ly will ire their true values. If, now, there is no

correlation between the Jiniseils values in the two cases, we have at once :

1 p-—l
mss iy = To-aely my SP N.

a @=D)@G= me :
PY PY PY

From this it follows at once that
NN = NNvy

or the second term in (xxx.) vanishes. Thus :

Mm, oor

R= sy

(xxx.) bis,
Thus R vanishes with 7, and no spurious correlation could arise from the existence
of fictitious values distributed at random through the correlation table. This result
might, indeed, (as it often is tacitly) be assumed by some, but it seems very desirable to
have a definite proof. It remains to consider = and 3’, We have:
