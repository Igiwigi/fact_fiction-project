This is only the case for the overlap in ranges above 650 GtCOz, i.e. for low gross FFI
CO emissions close to the limiting case and high estimates of the remaining 1.5°C budget [27]. Thus very deep FFI CO emissions reductions drawing on all levers from final energy demand
to carbon intensity reductions may still be able to limit warming to 1.5°C without overshoot if
and only if the 1.5°C budget turns out to be at the upper end of the estimated range. However,
this finding needs to be qualified by the fact that our limiting case of FFI CO2 emissions has
been constructed to make it unlikely that emissions could be even lower, at the expense of the
likelihood that it actually can be achieved. So the overlap might be vanishing small, even if the
1.5°C budget is high. If it is not high, CDR will become indispensable to limit warming to 1.5°C.
