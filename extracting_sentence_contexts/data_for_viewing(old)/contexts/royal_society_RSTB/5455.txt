original cavity of the skull.” In Sorex, the lateral half of the alicochlear commissure
does form the floor on which the limiting membrane of the cavum epiptericum rests.
The carotid artery on rising through its foramen finds itself median to the inner mem-
brane of the cavum epiptericum, and just beneath the dura mater, which it pierces to
enter the cranial cavity. At its very point of entry through the carotid foramen, the
carotid artery is median to the abducens nerve.

I have, therefore, no reason to doubt that the carotid artery and carotid foramen are
in every way identical with the similarly named structures in other vertebrates, and
that the alicochlear is the trabecula. In passing, | may mention that the courses
of the carotid and abducens in Lepus as described by Vorr (1909) are quite typical as
regards their morphological relations : the artery rises up passing median to the nerve.
The fact that the carotid artery enters to the outside of the nerve, and yet runs in
beneath it to rise up on its inner side, and thus preserve the typical relations, is additional
proof that the carotid of Lepus is the true carotid, which has undergone a slight topo-
graphical displacement. That the trabecula (alicochlear commissure), or rather its
lateral portion, should come to form the floor of an extra-cranial space (cavum epipteri-
cum) is easy to understand. ‘The cavum epiptericum itself is developed as an expanded
space accommodating the large trigeminal ganglion. In its expansion, this space has
extended laterally as far as the ala temporalis would allow, and since the skull-wall is
membranous in this region, it has bulged medially as well. In so doing, it has pushed
its way in over the trabecula, and may be said to rest upon it, much as in Selachians
the innermost part of the orbit “ rests ” on the subocular shelf.

The hindmost region of the cavum supracochleare is interesting, because it comes
