defend the notion that language provides an especially impor-
tant scaffold for embodied concepts in general and abstract
ones in particular.

A diverse body of evidence supports the thesis that our con-
cepts are embodied and grounded [9,10,12]. For example,
Pecher et al. [13] find a modality-switching cost associated
with a property verification task. Participants verified verbally
expressed facts involving one modality (such as the fact that
leaves rustle) more rapidly after verifying a fact involving the
same modality (such as the fact that blenders make noise) than
after verifying a fact involving a different modality (such as
the fact that cranberries are tart). Hearing motion-related verbs
interferes with visual motion processing [14] and visual
motion processing interferes with the processing of motion-
related verbs [15]. Neuroimaging data provide further evi-
dence of conceptual embodiment. Reading odour-related
words (e.g. cinnamon, garlic and jasmine) elicits increased acti-
vation in the primary olfactory cortex relative to neutral contro!
words [16], and reading action words (e.g. lick, pick and kick)
elicits increased activation in the cortical regions associated
with performing the relevant movements [17]. The specificity
of the modulated activity can be quite fine-grained. Right-
and left-handers exhibit increased activation in the premotor
areas that are contralateral to their dominant hands on lexical
