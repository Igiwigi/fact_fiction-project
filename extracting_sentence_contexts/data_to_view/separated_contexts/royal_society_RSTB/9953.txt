However, this ignores two issues. One is that there are econ-
omic reasons why the Tasmanians may have reduced their
reliance on fishing. For example, Andersson & Read [31] have
pointed out that the Tasmanians’ non-consumption of fish
could have been due to the fact that fish were not needed for
protein because of the ready availability of shellfish and seals,
and are not a source of carbohydrates. Under these conditions,
they aver, the investment required to obtain fish may actually
have been maladaptive. An alternative economic explanation
for the Tasmanians’ decision to fish less often has been outlined
by Hiscock [32].
