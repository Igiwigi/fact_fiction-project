Thus the general formula again holds good.

Tt is easy to verify that the other coefficients of are in fact reproduced.

The principal use of the transforming factors, determined in this section, is that it

$10. The Functions of the Second Kind.

The second continued fraction of § 6 terminates because
fi,s + 2n+4 2fi,s+2%n+4+1} =0
when n=} (i—s) or } (i—s—1), since one of the two factors then assumes the form
{i+ 1}.

Hence it follows that the equation for determining o is the same as before ; but we
