But to make the counter-arguments appear
credible—and empirical—NELA needed experts. Academics would play a crucial role.

4. The National Electric Light Association academic campaign

The NELA academic programme had three major components: (i) the recruitment of experts
to produce studies offering competing facts on the central question of the cost and efficiency
of private versus public electricity generation; (ii) the rewriting of textbooks to support and
promote the goals of the private electricity industry, including denying charges of corruption and
promulgating an image of the industry as ethical and trustworthy; and (iii) the revision of existing
academic programmes and creation of new ones to foster belief in the free market principles. The
first goal was intended to prevent the development of municipal electricity programmes in the
present; the second two were intended to ensure the long-term dominance of private electricity
in American life.

(a) Recruiting experts and constructing competing facts

The principal point of factual contention was the cost of electricity generation. However, by
NELA’s admission the goal was not to support objective study of the matter, but to ‘kill’ the
municipal ownership idea.
