The maximum value of I; occurred when the Permalloy magnetization had nearly completed its : =
switching, whereas the Co magnetization was still in the middle of the switching process. As a : S
result, there were substantial regions of the sample where the Permalloy and Co magnetizations : 2
were non-collinear, giving rise to large spin-triplet supercurrent. 14

The results of Banerjee et al. [44] were the best attempt at the time towards reproducible control _
of spin-triplet supercurrent. But they suffer from the fact that the magnetic configuration where 4
the largest I; is observed is not stable to small changes in the applied field. One would like to 7s
have a situation where a sample is put into a certain configuration by applying a field, the applied : ez
field is then removed, and the sample stays in the same configuration. Two ongoing experiments 1g

in our laboratory have this goal.
