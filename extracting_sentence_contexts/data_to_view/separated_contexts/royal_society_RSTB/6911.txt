4. OBSERVATIONS ON PARTIALLY ISOLATED LEAF PRIMORDIA

In the ferns as a class the leaves, or megaphylls, are large in proportion to the shoot on
which they are borne. Indeed, it has been held that the leaves dominate the axis and, in
some species, this view is apparently supported by the details of vascular anatomy. In
phytonic as contrasted with axial theories of the leaf-shoot type of organization, it may
even be denied that the shoot has any real existence apart from the leaves; that it is, in
fact, no more than a structure derived from the fusion of decurrent leaf-bases. Although
the concept of phytons has usually only a subjective significance, some investigators (e.g.
Campbell 1921) have given it an objective meaning. Elsewhere, the writer (Wardlaw 1944 5)
has shown that if all the leaf primordia are systematically removed from the shoot, the
latter nevertheless continues its axial growth and develops a solenostelic vascular system.
