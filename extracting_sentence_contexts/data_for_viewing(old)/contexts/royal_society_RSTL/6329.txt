or both have been derived from some intermediate form (such as that which seems
common alike to the young of both), the modifications which have given rise to the
marked differences they now exhibit are mainly due to diversities in the external con-
ditions under which they have been respectively propagated.

244. But to what other type does Peneroplis itself present the closest approximation ?
By systematists in general the intimate relationship which I have shown it to possess to
the helical type of Orbiculing («| 130) has been 80 slightly regarded, that it has been
considered as at least equally related to the Operculine type; and yet, as T hall pre-
sently show, these two types are removed from each other in all the most essential
features of their structure, as far as any two polythalamous Foraminifera can be. And
the idea of the derivation of Peneroplis from the same stock with Orbiculina, s8eems
justified by the fact that the young forms of the two are frequently 80 alike as not to
be distinguishable by external characters alone, whilst their internal difference consists
only in the presence or absence of the secondary or transverse septa, a character which
I have shown reason to regard as yariable in this group* (« 130).

245. Notwithstanding, therefore, the apparently wide divergence of the cyclical Orbi-
tolites, the helical Orviculina, the fusiform Alveolina, and the simply-chambered Pene-
roplis and Dendriting, these several types must be regarded as most intimately related
to one another; and that relationship seems to me much more likely to have arisen
from a common ancestral descent, than from the original creation of independent types
capable of graduating into each other s0 continuously as almost to assume each other's
characters. It is very important to remark that they all possess that peculiar texture of
shell, which is designated by Professor WILLIAMSON as porcellanous; preenting an opake
