§ 18. In the case of the mean annual temperature, the long-period mean was
intermediate in all three instances between those for the periods of sun-spot maximum
and minimum, and the differences between these two latter means are fairly similar. The existence of a difference between the average mean temperature of years of
sun-spot maximum and minimum is accepted as an established fact in Hawnn’s
‘Climatology.’* According to Hann’s figures the mean excess of temperature in a
period of four sun-spot minimum years over a period of four sun-spot maximum years,
situated relatively to maximum and minimum as in the case of the Falmouth groups
of years, is for a tropical station no less than 0°55 C., the difference between the two

extreme years of an 11-year period amounting to 0°73 C. At an average extra-
tropical station, according to HANN, this latter figure is reduced to 0°54 C. Allowing
tentatively a corresponding reduction on the 0°55 C., it becomes 0°41 C, Thus the
differences recorded in Table XX.
