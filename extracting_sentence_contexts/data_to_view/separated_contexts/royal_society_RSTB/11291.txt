The putative sporangia are
highly variable in shape, with the better developed ones resem-
bling cup-shaped gametangiophores. Furthermore, spores—a
diagnostic feature of sporangia—were not observed. Here, fea-
tures originally interpreted as sporangia might in fact be
gametangiophores fossilized at different developmental stages. Within the current circumscription of the genus Cooksortia
[67], some fossil are undoubtedly sporophytes because
spores have been observed in situ. Others with flared, trum-
pet-shaped ends might plausibly represent a more or less
isomorphic gametophyte phase.
