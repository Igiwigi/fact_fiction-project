the monthly values that the dates of the minimum would agree closely with those in
columns B., G. & H., if they were available.

It must be borne in mind that these are independent investigations, excepting that
the figures in columns G. & H., and W., are mostly dependent on the same material.
The observations in England were nearly all made at or after sunset, so that solar
radiation is excluded; they were also made with an entirely different type of
instrument, and refer to a different period. The observations on the Continent were
made in the morning; about 8 or 9 a.m. would, perhaps, be a fair average. (With
regard to the greater range on the Continent, see p. 261, line 5.)

The following facts appear from the tables. The temperature decreases steadily up
to a height of about 10 or 11 km. (9 or 10 km. at Pawlowsk), and remains almost
stationary above that height. The annual range decreases from the surface up to
2 or 3 km.; it then continues nearly constant, with perhaps a small increase at
7 or 8 km., up to about 11 km., at which point it is abruptly reduced to less than half
its former value. In the strata above 1 or 2 km. the maximum and minimum yalues
are delayed for about a month, but above the point at which the vertical temperature
gradient ceases they come back and occur at the summer and winter solstices.

This point is higher in summer than in winter; it is higher in England and the
central part of the Continent than at Pawlowsk (59° 41’ N., 30° 29’ E.). Up to it
the gradient of temperature is much the same in all places and at all seasons,
excepting in so far as the larger annual range of temperature in the East produces a
