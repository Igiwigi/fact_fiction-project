This symmetry is broken as soon as additional scattering phases change the value of the
phase a away from 7/2. This occurs in the case of the excitation of waveguide modes in
our sample. Because of the interference between the direct and indirect transmission channels
and because of the fact that the indirect transmission exhibits an additional phase, the overall
transmission becomes asymmetric. For sample A, the extinction and phase evolutions, as derived
by the S-matrix, are again shown in figure 10a and directly compared with the result obtained
with the oscillator model in figure 10b. The parameters used for the model were |fwo| = 0.8,
Awe =lc/Ewc = 798.5nm, Iwo = 10 meV, awc = 0.42 and gp = 0.
