As the

electrons rotating round each other in equal orbits, their secular effects just cancel each other, so that
the molecule as a whole is non-magnetic. This exact cancelling will not however usually occur when
there are more than two electrons in the molecule, or when a number of molecules are bound together
in a group as in the case of an iron magnet. Similar considerations also apply as regards the ave;
electric moment of a molecule, which is in fact the electric moment of the Gaussian secular equival
above described.
