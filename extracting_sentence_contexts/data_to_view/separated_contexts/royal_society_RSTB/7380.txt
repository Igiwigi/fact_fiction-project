F. Millspaugh, then curator of Botany in the Field Museum, Chicago, who
reported: ‘It is not possible to determine the species of the Nicotianae from leaves
alone.... However I judge that the species you submit from Guinea is Nicotiana
suaveolens.... My opinion that the species is N. suaveolens is based mostly on the fact
that that is the prevailing species cultivated in Africa (south) and on the islands
adjacent.’ Millspaugh evidently mistook New Guinea for the Guinea coast, and his
statement that N. suaveolens is cultivated in South Africa is entirely unsupported by
other writers. Laufer (1930, p. 3) refers to N. tabacum and N. rustica as the only species
of tobacco in Africa, where they were introduced from America.
