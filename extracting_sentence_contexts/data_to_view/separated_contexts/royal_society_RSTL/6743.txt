This may be to s8ome extent true; but it is also certain that the evaporation
from the moist straw, by throwing over the pans an atmosphere of aqueous vapour,
would check the radiation and thus tend to diminish the cold. MeLLox1, in his excellent paper * On the Nocturnal Radiation of Bodies,” gives a
theory of the 8erein, or excessiyely fine rain which sometimes falls in a clear sky a few
moments after 8unset. Several authors, he says, attribute this effect to the cold resulting
from radiation of the air during the fine season immediately on the departure of the un.

power of pure transparent elastic fluids, it appears to me more conformable to the prin-
ciples of natural philosophy to attribute this species of rain, to the radiation and subse-
quent condensation of a thin veil of vesicular vapour distributed through the higher
strata of the atmosphere ”*. Now, however, that the power of aqueous vapour as a
radiant is known, the difficulty experienced by MELLONI disappears. The former hypo-
thesis, however, though probably correct in ascribing the effect to radiation, was incor-
rect in ascribing it to the radiation of *the air.”
