The influence of the moon upon the barometer, although small in amount, was
shown in a very striking and decided manner; for after eliminating the regular
diurnal variation, the differences arranged in lunar tables showed a decided maxi-
mum, both at the superior and inferior culmination of the moon, and a decided
minimum at its rising and setting. The effect which the moon's position, relatively to the meridian of the place, had
upon the barometric pressure, was publicly noticed, about the middle of 1842, by
Captain Leproy, R.A., who appears to have bad his attention directed to it from the
first establishment of the observatory at St. Helena. On the receipt of Colonel Sanixx's paper, I was anxious to ascertain if the fact of
the moon's influence, s0 clearly and decidedly shown at St. Helena, could be similarly
proved by the Singapore barometric observations. I therefore determined, before leaving England for India, to proceed upon the
plan adopted by Colonel Sapixs, and in order that a comparison might be made be-
tween the results at Singapore and at St. Helena, have copied to a considerable
extent the form of the different lunar tables drawn up by him in his very valuable
paper. The observatory at Singapore was in latitude 1* 18' 32” north, and longitude 103*
56' 30” east of Greenwich.
