Q
& where it will be seen that the values of the minimum spark potentials, for air, over
8 this large range of spark lengths vary by only 7 volts. The values for hydrogen,
g over the same large range of spark lengths, vary by only 5 volts, and those for
@ carbon dioxide by only 4 volts. ‘° These results, then, seem to establish the fact that the least spark potential
§ required to break down a gas is entirely independent of the spark length. > It is evident, too, from figs.
