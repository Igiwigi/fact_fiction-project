Provision of clear and quantitative information on the rationale for geoengineering
and engagement with the public and policy-makers has also lagged behind
[6]. This has resulted in a polarization of views, with technology enthusiasts,
sometimes holding patents into the techniques they are promoting, juxtaposed
against environmental pressure groups who are strongly opposed to any attempt
to address the climate problem by geoengineering, considering it unethical
and diverting resources from mitigation. This difference of opinions can be
exasperated by the media, who often focus on the ‘wackier’ ideas, presenting
geoengineering research as impossible science fiction. Yet scientists and engineers
are far from blameless in how geoengineering is perceived, particularly in a
tendency to frame specific proposals as a single ‘cure-all’ for future climate change.
As reliance on any one technology for climate mitigation effectively creates a
single point of failure, it should not be surprising that a reactionary fear of risky
interference in the climate system by geoengineering arises, further complicating
the debate.

We might take lessons from conventional mitigation and frame the potential
role of geoengineering in terms of ‘wedges’—i.e. aiming to build up a desired
climate mitigation via a suite of diverse technologies and approaches. Wedges
could be regional and seasonal in their climate mitigation as much as global and
with a more constant effect, targeting either full or partial mitigation of specific
