as in §§ 33, 34, but whilst reducing one it would also increase the other.

Considering, however, the complexity of the problem the preceding results justify,
to a remarkable degree, the assumptions that have had to be made in the course of the
investigation.

The experiments made with the pulleys on different spans are very instructive as
showing how one pulley affects the other in regard to whirling. For example,
Experiments 130, 131, 135, and 134 show that, when the two pulleys are both taken
into account, the calculated speed is much too low. Hence we may infer that if
Pulley I (which is the lighter of the two) be placed on the far side of the centre of
its span from the middle bearing, its effect on the whirling speed is very small. The
whirling speed may, in fact, be taken as that resulting from the combined effects
of the heavier pulley and the shaft. On this assumption, the calculated whirling
speeds in the above four experiments would be (see § 44, Experiments 110, 109) 3056,
3056, 2600 and 2600 respectively, and the percentage errors would be + 5, + 6°2,
+7, and + 3°4, instead of + 4°4, + 8°7, + 4°7, and + 6°4,

46. The discrepancies between the observed and calculated results are accounted
for by the fact that the empirical formula—viz., N,N./,/(N,? + N,°)—upon which the
resulting calculated speeds are based, is not strictly accurate. In the case, however,
of two or more equal spans with pulleys on each span, that formula gives calculated
results Jess than the observed results and, therefore, erring on the right side. This
is apparent from Experiment 130-140, but it might also be proved by considering the
case of two equal spans with a pulley placed in the centre of each span. If the two
