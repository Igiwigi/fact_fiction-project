ON THE ARAUCARIEA!, RECENT AND EXTINCT. 391

the Eusporangiate Filicine.‚Äù Our contention is that this opinion as to the ancestry
of the Coniferales, or at least the Araucaries, is one which deserves more attention
than it has recently received and, in the present state of our knowledge, it is the
view which appears to us the more probable. In the first place it is essential to form
an opinion as to the position of the Araucaries within the Coniferales ; we shall not
attempt, at least in this communication, a revision of the grouping of the whole of
this somewhat heterogeneous section of the Gymnosperms, but restrict ourselves to
one definite point, are the Araucaries primitive in comparison with other Conifers ?
That they are among the oldest members of this group may be taken as an established
fact, and we go a step further in believing that they bear the impress of plants of a
comparatively low or primitive type.

Some of the features which we regard as supporting this view have already been
mentioned, but we will now briefly consider the morphology of the reproductive
shoots as a test of the primitive character of the Araucariez.

In a monograph on the male flowers of Gymnosperms, TurBout* states that those
of Araucaries exhibit points in common with the flowers of Cycads. In the structure
of the sporophylls and in the arrangement of the vascular tissue Turnout considers
that the Araucarie, more than any other Conifers, resemble the Cycadacese, But
we are disposed to take the view that the male flowers of Cycads and Conifers are
not constructed on a sufficiently similar plan to render easy a close comparison. The
