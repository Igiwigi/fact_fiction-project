reduction is further indicated by the fact that while citrinin gives an iodine brown colour
with FeCl;, reduced citrinin gives an initial blue colour becoming iodine brown on
addition of excess of FeCl,.

(5) Bromine compound of citrinin.—A bromine compound was obtained by treating
citrinin with bromine in glacial acetic acid. This gave rise to a yellow crystalline
compound, M.Pt. 121° C., which decomposed readily on treatment with water, with
the formation of hydrobromic acid.

(6) Distillation of citrinin with zinc dust.—An attempt was made to obtain the basal
aromatic nucleus contained in the molecule of citrinin by distillation with zine dust,
but no product could be isolated except a small quantity of tarry distillate with a
strong phenolic odour.
