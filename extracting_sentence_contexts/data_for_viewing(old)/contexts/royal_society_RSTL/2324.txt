As the females approach the Oviparous Fertebrata in their separate genital tubes, 80
also the males resemble them in the peculiar structure and connexions of the intro-
mittent organ ; thus, in the Macropi, the Dasyuri and the Phalangist&, the cor-
pora cavernosa penis have the same position below the pubis, with the same want of
ligamentous attachment to the bony pelvis; and the glans has the same bifurcated
form and double groove for the transmission of the semen as in the Opossum, in which
these peculiarities of the male organs were first accurately described by Coweer#*.

In those genera in which the females have an inward fold of integument, or abdo-
minal pouch, the males have an outward duplicature in the corresponding situation
for the lodgement of the testes, which are thus placed anterior to the penis; and it is
a remarkable fact, that the muscle which surrounds the mammary gland in the one
Sex is analogous to the suspensory cremaster of the testis in the other.

Both sexes in the marsupial genera manifest, also their affinity to the oviparous
classes in possessing two superior yene cavze, and in the want of the inferior mesen-
teric artery: and the marsupial bones, 80 common in the skeletons of reptiles, are
