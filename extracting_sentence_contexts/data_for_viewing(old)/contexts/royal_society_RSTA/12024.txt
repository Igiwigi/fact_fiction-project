i.e., k, x ave harmonic with regard to DY. ‘Thus k, « are the foci of the involution
OG, DY, and are therefore given when K is given.

3. Now the IDH scheme depends on a triangle and one other straight line. Thus
any two such schemes can be projected into one another; ¢.e., excluding for the
present (1) the cubic with three real concurrent inflexional tangents, (2) the crunodal
cubic, (3) the cuspidal cubic, we may say “all cubics have the same framework.” But
in connecting projectively the frameworks of two cubics we have exhausted the possi-
bilities of projection, and so have no means of bringing the K’s of the two cubies to
coincidence ; thus different positions of the three K’s on h give essentially distinct
cubics, so exhibiting clearly the known fact that the essential nature of the general
cubie depends on one parameter only.

Since we can project so that the triangle D,D,D, becomes equilateral, while the
line (I) goes to infinity, we can always use a symmetrical diagram. This simplifica-
tion is adopted for most of the diagrams here given.
