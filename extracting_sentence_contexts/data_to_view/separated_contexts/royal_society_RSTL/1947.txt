FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY,

$ 10. On Conducting Power generally.

418. It is not my intention here to enter into an examination of all the cir-
cumstances connected with conducting power, but to record certain facts and
observations which have arisen during recent inquiries, as additions to the gene-
ral stock of knowledge relating to this point of electrical science.

419. I was anxious, in the first place, to obtain some idea of the conducting
power of ice and solid salts for electricity of high tension (392.), that a com-
parison might be made between it and the large accession of the same power
gained upon liquefaction. For this purpose the large electrical machine (290.)
was brought into excellent action, its conductor connected with a delicate gold-
leaf electrometer, and also with the platina inclosed in the ice, whilst the tin case
was connected with the discharging train (292.).
