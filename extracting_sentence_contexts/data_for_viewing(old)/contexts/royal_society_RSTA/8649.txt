In this and the following two sections we shall examine more closely the means by
which the platinum wire grid is enabled to record electrically the aerial vibrations
which are set up in the neck of the resonator. Suppose in the first instance that a
microphone is held with its axis vertical (neck uppermost), and that the grid is connected
in series with a battery and the primary of the first stage transformer of an amplifier.
It is found by experiment that the temperature of the platinum wire, when carrying its
normal safe working current of about 29 milliamperes, is in the neighbourhood of
600Â° C., and we know that in these circumstances the energy supplied to the wire in

the form of heat is lost mainly by convection. There is in fact above the grid a free
convection current whose velocity depends on the temperature and diameter of the
platinum wire. A sound of suitable pitch produces in the neck of the resonator an
alternating current of air which is superimposed upon the free convection current,
with the result that the convection of heat from the platinum wire is alternately retarded
and accelerated. It can easily be seen that if the maximum velocity of the alternating
air-current does not exceed the velocity of the convection current, the periodic tempera-
ture change produced in the platinum wire will have the same frequency as that of the
sound stimulating the resonator.

This is in accordance with the observed fact that when the microphone is held
vertically the note heard in the telephones has the same pitch as that of the original
sound.
