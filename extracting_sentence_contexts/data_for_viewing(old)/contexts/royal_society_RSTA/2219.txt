started with J.J. Thomson in his famous Treatise on the Motion of Vortex Rings (1883), for a model
for the atom [5,6] (figures 3 and 4).


Motivated especially by atmosphere observations, in this article we consider the dynamics of a
system of point vortices on a two-dimensional sphere, and, more specifically, the stability of a ring
of identical vortices in the presence of a polar vortex at each pole. Such a system—as discussed
widely in the literature, see for example [2,7]—is described by a Hamiltonian system of equations
and in [8] we do a detailed analysis of the general case with one or more rings. Motivated also by
the polygonal coherent structure present in the Earth’s atmosphere during particular periods of
the year, in this article we summarized what we have found for the particular case of total vorticity
equal to zero. Besides possible geophysical motivations, such a case is particularly interesting
from a mathematical point of view, for its universality. In fact as we have discussed in previous
articles—see for example [1,9,10]—a starting point of the mathematical formulation of the study
of Euler incompressible fluids is the solution of the Poisson equation AY =a, where W is the
stream function of a passive tracer advected by the velocity field generated by the vorticity field
w. When solving the equation above on a sphere the fact that the surface is closed imposes an

extra condition:
i} odo =0,
sg

where do denotes the element of area in S?. (We shall also use do or, in some cases do’ for
other surfaces.) This implies that the corresponding equation for the Green function—i.e. the
fundamental solution of the Poisson equation—also has to verify such a condition, and it is
