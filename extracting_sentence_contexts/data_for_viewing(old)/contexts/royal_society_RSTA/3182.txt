[AaBypAg By] - Aa By = AgBy « [Aa By Aa By].

Because of (3.61), this is equivalent to proving that
[AaBpAw Bw] - Aa” Byr = [v2 AgBy] - Aan Bur = vb yt rea By
= AgBy - [Av ByAarByr] = AgBy - [vit Ag By] = yee, yah AgByr
SS yt AaBy = yep vie AaByr
and, because of (3.57), this is equivalent to

abl ,ab” _.a'b”, ab"
Verb Vary = Verb’ Verb’

which is identically satisfied because of (3.49).
The two partitions of the identity A = (Aq) and B = (By) are maximal in A. In fact, if an element
X= oq AadbAaBy commutes with all the A,’, then, for each A,’,

Ay (x sida) = ravAaBy = (x sida) Aw

For each a” £ a’, multiplying both sides on the left by Ag”, one finds
