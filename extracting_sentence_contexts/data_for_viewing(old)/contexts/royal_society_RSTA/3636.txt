based on credible estimates; actual compensation rates will vary from plant-to-plant depending
on the emissions intensity of production activity relative to the benchmark.

Figure 5, based on table 2, demonstrates the perverse situation—caused by the limited sectoral
coverage of the UK CPS, the difference in the carbon prices charged across the schemes and
differing rates of compensation—that primary steel-makers are effectively taxed at a carbon
price that is 10% of that levied on secondary steel-makers. This encourages primary steel-
making over secondary steel-making despite the emissions savings associated with secondary
steel-making (which accounts for a quarter of the emissions per tonne of steel associated with
primary steel-making). More importantly for this article, the table shows that expenditure on
carbon taxes (that are levied at rates far below estimates of the social cost of carbon) is further
reduced radically through compensation schemes: primary steel-makers are effectively charges
30p/tCO2 and secondary steel-makers are effectively charged £2.30/tCOz2 despite the fact that
the EUETS charges approximated £5/tCOz and the UKCPS is set at £18/tCO2. The potential
distortions caused by these compensation mechanisms to downstream incentives are twofold.
Firstly, if companies do not pass on the opportunity cost associated with freely allocated EUETS
allowances, the downstream incentives offered by this scheme will be severely limited. Secondly,
the method by which energy-intensive industries are currently compensated for their carbon
costs (in line with equation (3.3)) means that they do not see the full cost of carbon embodied in
their production decisions so are barely incentivized to reduce their use of embodied emissions
inputs. Although steel-makers may be expected to pass on the opportunity cost of freely obtained
allowances, they would not be expected to pass on the cost of indirect carbon costs for which they
are compensated.
