If therefore the actual rate of the watch should be obseryed when the balance vi-
brates by the action of the auxiliary springs only, it is probable that the time shewn
by the watch in 6o seconds of mean time might differ s0mewhat from that which has
been here $stated.

Since these notes were written, I have been favoured by hjs Excellency Count Bz uns
with an account of an observation made on the-rate of Mr. Mupce's first time-
keeper, when the balance vibrated by the action of the auxiliary springs only, the ba-
lance spring being removed. According to this observation, the watch shewed twelve
minutes by the motion of the hands in one hour of mean time, which corresponds to
an interval of 12 seconds of time, shewn by the watch in 60 seconds, or one minute of
mean time. According to the calculation, 33 seconds of time are shewn by the
watch in one minute. A nearer agreement between the theory and matter of fact could
scarcely be expected in the circumstances of the experiment,
