impermeable cap rock delimiting the aquifer, which leads locally to a stratification of less
dense CO) on top of salt water. Upon dissolution of CO in the lower aqueous host phase, a
zone of denser water containing CO2 grows diffusively below the interface. After some time,
convection sets in, whereby fingers of the denser CO-enriched water sink into the fresh water.
This convective fingering illustrated in figure 6 is beneficial to the sequestration technique, as
it enhances mixing and further dissolution of CO) in the water. Understanding the optimum
conditions for this convective capture and dissolution has generated a lot of modelling [54-61]
and experimental [62-71] studies over the years. Indeed, owing to the difficulty of in situ studies,
political decisions on future sequestration techniques rely heavily on theoretical predictions based
on numerical simulations of the problem. To benchmark these models, quantitative comparison
with experiments is of tantamount importance.

In this context, one should be cautious about the fact that some experiments visualize
convective dissolution of CO2 due to colour indicators that track the pH changes associated with

the acidification inherent to dissolution of CO, in water [40,63,64,67]. While this greatly helps
in recording the dynamics, one should realize that the contours of the fingers imaged are pH
isocurves specific to the colour indicator selected, which is not necessarily equivalent to the very
contours of the CO fingers. Using pH indicators might thus sometimes provide an incorrect
tracking of the convective zone, as shown recently using optical Schlieren techniques [10]. Other
