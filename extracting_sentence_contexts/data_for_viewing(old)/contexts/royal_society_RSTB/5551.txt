occupying a median position. This must be due to the requirements of brain growth,
the neuromeres here forming the major portion of the brain. Head appendages during
development, or subsequently, are associated with the mouth. If the protocerebral
appendages, somites and neuromere, were to retain the spatial relations which obtain
in the body region, brain growth of the first segment would push its segmental append-
ages to a position at the sides having no reference to the mouth. A reversal of position
between the appendage and somite on the one hand and the neuromere on the other
has enabled these appendages to retain their functional connection with the mouth. I
suggest, therefore, that all the elements necessary to form a complete segment are present
in the first segment of the head in Pieris, a pair of somites, a neuromere and a pair of
limbs.

With regard to the epipharynx the facts that it arises as a paired structure, quite
as distinct as the premandibular appendages, and that it possesses a small double mass
of mesoderm which passes into it as it develops into the median lobe, may tempt one
to the conclusion that another segment is concerned here. It must be remembered,
however, that the mesoderm of the epipharynx is secondarily separated from the

protocerebral mesoderm. This together with the fact that no neuromere is present,
leads one naturally to the conclusion that there is no segmental significance to be
attached to the at first bifid epipharynx. I contend therefore that the embryology of
Pieris fully substantiates the orthodox conception of the six-segmented constitution
