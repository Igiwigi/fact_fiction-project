The progressive concealment of gyri within the sulci and fissures thus formed
constitutes a most interesting problem. The study of hereditary resemblances in the brain should not be limited to the
sulci only, but with every work a beginning is needed, and the future may augment
the material, as well as the opportunity of further detailed anatomical investigation. Thus a parallel examination of the architectonic fields might be undertaken ; in fact
Epcar Scuuster has already examined the extension of the striation of the occipital
pole. The measurements of the gyri are also indispensable for the determination of the
furrows. As a rule the supplementary sulci or differences in their direction appear as
a result of a greater development of the neighbouring convolutions.
