(1) Magnetic needles delicately mounted on an horizontal axis s0 as to admit
of motion in a vertical plane, remained at rest when the axis was perpendicular
to the radius of the reyolving disc ; but the needles appeared to be carried in
the direction of its motion when the axis was turned in the same plane. 10. The above facts seem to show very clearly, that the presence of permanent
magnetism, and a susceptibility of magnetic induction are essential conditions
in the phenomena of rotation hitherto observyed : at least this deduction is fair
for all distances between the bodies at which they can be well placed with an
intervening screen : without a screen it seems extremely difficult ever to arrive
at a satisfactory result ; since eyen in a very rare medium (Exp (a), (b), (c),
(d)) vortices are produced by the action of a rapidly revolving body, although
with perfectly rounded and smooth edges, capable of carrying round light sub-
stances ; and although separated from snch substances by a considerable in-
teryal. So far therefore as this method of examining the influence which bodies
not permanently magnetic can exert on each other extends, it seems not s1s-
ceptible of the requisite precision ; and is, therefore, in a great degree inade-
quate to detect any very minute and delicate force, which can be supposed to
arise from such an influence. 11.
