This has led to the : &
well-known CLAW hypothesis, whereby a negative feedback exists between the production of : S
DMS in the ocean and the albedo of the sky and clouds, thus regulating Earth’s climate [2]. :S

Although this hypothesis inspired much research, there are still large uncertainties about many
aspects of the hypothesis, especially in remote locations like the Southern Ocean. Modelling the radiation budget around Antarctica is one of the biggest uncertainties in
projections of global climate. This is at least partly due to the fact that oxidation pathways in the
atmosphere are intrinsically complex, with large impacts on the efficiency of the DMS to soz”
pathway [3]. Nonetheless, high numbers of ultra-fine particles have been observed in air masses
coming from Antarctic sea-ice areas, and it has been suggested that DMS is a potential source [4]. Indeed, high DMS fluxes have been found above sea ice, but it remains unclear how much can be
attributed to direct flux from surface communities in ice, or from leads between ice floes where
surface-microlayer concentrations of DMS are typically 10-fold higher than in the underlying
water column [5,6].
