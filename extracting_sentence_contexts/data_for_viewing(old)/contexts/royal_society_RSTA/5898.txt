* with probability w apply the deactivation process: s; = 1 — s; = 0. (Rule 1).
¢ with probability 1—w, the agents i and j follow the BCS model: 0;(t + 1) =0;(t) +
14;30;(t), where j1;; follows the PDF of equation (2.2) (Rule 2).

---- Ifiis inactive:

if i and j have the same opinion (0; =0;) and j is active: apply the activation process

As discussed in the Introduction, during a public debate there are people that that are not
active/ open for discussion. But they can become active due to peers’ influence. As discussed in
[11,14], active agents may gradually lose their interests in the discussion and drop out of it, which
is related to our above Rule 1. In addition, our above Rule 2 is based on the fact that only active
agents participate in the opinion dynamics. Finally, as also discussed in [11,14], active agents can
motivate their inactive like-minded peers. If an inert agent holds the same opinion of an active
neighbour and they have a positive interaction (with takes place with probability 1 — p), then the
inert agent is driven to be active with probability (1 — p)g. In other words, in order to have an
activation with probability g, we considered as a necessary condition that the randomly chosen
agents i and j have to interact positively, which occurs with probability 1 — p, leading to the final
probability (1 — p)g. These last sentences justify our above Rule 3.

3. Results

Ina given time step f, let x+1(#), xo(#) and x_1(t) be the proportion of inactive agents with opinions
+1, 0 and —1, respectively. Also, let f,.1(t), fo(t) and f_1(t) be the proportion of active agents with
