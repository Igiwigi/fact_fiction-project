When I myself grasped the metal box my fingers soon became blanched and cold. It appears that Echidna is devoid of both sweat-mechanism and vaso-motor adjust-
ment of superficial circulation in response to temperature. This was suggested by
the fact that the production of CO, was so nearly directly proportional to the
difference in temperature between the animal and environment, in other words, was
proportional to loss of heat. Without means of losing heat by evaporation from the skin, or of increasing
evaporation from the lungs by additional respirations, Echidna is incapable of adapting
itself to an environment the temperature of which is above 35째-37째 C., for it cannot
reduce its heat-production below a certain minimum which is itself dependent upon
the body-temperature. When exposed to a temperature of 35째 C. its body-tempera-
ture soon rises above the physiological maximum (about 38째 C.), this causes further
heat-production, and it dies of heat apoplexy.
