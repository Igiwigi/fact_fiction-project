In fact, as can be seen in figure 4, the outer corrosion crust on
sample M03 was predominantly composed of goethite (blue image), while magnetite (red image)
was the main compound of the inner layer. This stratigraphic composition is quite common in Fe-based archaeological finds. In fact, iron
oxides tend to be located in the inner corrosion layers (in this case, magnetite was probably
generated in a second step as a result of the decrease of oxygen levels due to the formation of
new outer rust layers). On the contrary, the corrosion surface, being more exposed to the external
environment, tends to be mainly composed of iron oxyhydroxides [32]. As shown in figure 4, Raman imaging also helped to demonstrate that Cl-affected areas
were characterized by the presence of reactive phases such as akaganeite (yellow image) and
lepidocrocite (light blue image).
