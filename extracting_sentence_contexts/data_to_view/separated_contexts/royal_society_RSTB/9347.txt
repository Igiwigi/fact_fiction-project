Adversarialism is an incomparably efficient way of narrowing
down the issues and getting to the heart of factual disputes
[51,55]. Criminal procedure regulates not only the generation
and presentation of evidence, but also its testing and evalu-
ation. It is surely plausible to maintain, as a general
proposition, that evidence that has withstood concerted foren-
sic examination offers securer epistemic warrant for judicial
fact-finding and jury verdicts than evidence that has never
been tested in the forensic crucible. This is not to deny that adversarialism is capable of generat-
ing perverse incentives for the parties to defeat truth-seeking. To the contrary, there is ample experience and some research
evidence to confirm the common sense prediction, that police,
prosecutors and defence lawyers have been known to present
false evidence or conceal relevant information [56-58].
