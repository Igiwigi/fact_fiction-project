But, as is well known, we also have

so that we have
V = 4V*H (w’,). This is a relation among the differential invariants, and it is due to the intrinsic
nature of the quantities E, F, G, L, M, N; accordingly, the number of algebraically
independent invariants up to the present order must (§ 23) be diminished by unity,
on account of the preceding relation. It was noted, in § 21, that H(w’,) and I (0, w’,) are alternatives in a complete

relation

subsists. Now the significance of I (w, w’,) is known: we have
