the increase of chemical action, and this pressure would produce not only the forward
wave of detonation, but also a sudden backward wave of compression into the gases
still slowly burning behind it. This compression-wave must raise the temperature of
the ignited gases and so quicken the residual burning ; its propagation would then be
analogous to that of the detonation-wave, but modified by the extent to which the
slow combustion has proceeded. I believe this view accounts for the facts described
and also for the phenomena observed in the initial period of the explosion (see
Part VI). The retonation-wave attains its greatest rapidity and brightness when it is
developed at the closed end of a tube, z.e., when the gas is fired at such a distance
from the closed end that the explosion, gradually increasing in intensity, just reaches
the detonation point as it arrives at the stopper. Under such conditions the reflected
wave is superposed on the wave of retonation, and the result is a wave which cannot
be distinguished from a true detonation.
