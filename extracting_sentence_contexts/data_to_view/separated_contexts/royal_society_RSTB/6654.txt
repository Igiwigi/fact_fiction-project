There is little means of telling exactly how long this phase of peat formation really
lasted, but the Late Iron Age beads at St German’s suggest that it may have gone on
until the time of the Roman invasion of Britain. In the fens thick deposits of roddon
silt (above the upper peat) had been colonized by about the end of the twelfth
century A.D. It would be misleading to close this description of the upper peat phase without
calling attention to one of its most striking characteristics—the fact that between it
and overlying deposits there is very frequently a most marked erosion surface. At
Chapel Point, Swinnerton shows that channels cut many feet through the upper peat
into the lower clays, and he recalls that Skertchly figured similar erosion through the
thickest peat bed exposed along Popham’s Eau, a bed which is almost certainly the
same as the ‘“‘two foot”? peat bed at St German’s. At the Poplar Farm roddon, the
same erosion is well marked (Godwin 1938), the Peacock’s Farm roddon (fig. 34)
flowed in a similar channel cut through the upper peat, and Fowler also records that
the upper surface of the fen clay is everywhere abundantly cut into by “old runs”,
such as that at Southery.
