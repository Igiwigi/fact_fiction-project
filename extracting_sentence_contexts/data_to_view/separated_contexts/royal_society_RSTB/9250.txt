Hence, from this viewpoint, the larger an animal is, the
more likely it should be to develop cancer during its lifetime. This supposition is,
however, not support by empirical observations, which suggest that smaller ani-
mals have a relatively higher rate of cancer compared with larger animals,
or conversely larger animals have a lower than relative expected rate of cancer
development. In fact, quantitative analysis supports this contention [6]. This
non-concordance is known as Petoâ€™s paradox [6-9]. Author for correspondence:
