rare events within and across long trajectories can be built from patterns of eigenvalues, which
are substantially smaller to manage and visualize than the original trajectories.

Our use of multidirectional scaling, such as the eigen decomposition of distance matrices, to
quantify the variances in one or more relevant substructures has been discussed in depth for
trajectories of folding proteins in [23,24]. In our past work, we showed how the dramatic variances
of eigenvalues can be associated with rare events in two use cases such as the transformation of
amino acids from an a-helix into a straight -strand and the swinging of a protein helix with
respect to the rest of the protein.

5. Protein variants and protein engineering

The third algorithm builds upon the fact that proteins with similar sequences have similar
functions. Our algorithms can be used to support the measurement of millions of protein
variants expressed to produce desired properties (protein engineering). Our mapping transforms
heterogeneous macromolecules such as proteins to capture and exposure structure (i.e. secondary
