Museum in Singapore, by Moshe Safdie (2011); and the Lotus Building in Wujin, China, by Studio 505 (2013). On the right, three
buildings that extract only materiality from objects of inspiration: the Water Cube in Beijing, China, by PTW Architects and
Arup (2007); the Grange Audubon Society in Columbus, Ohio, USA, by DesignGroup (2009); and the Bullitt Foundation Center in
Seattle, Washington, USA, by Miller Hull (2012).

On the right side of figure 24, we see examples of projects that are too abstract (over-
functional). Pictured are the Water Cube in Beijing, China, by PTW Architects and Arup (2007);
the Grange Audubon Society in Columbus, Ohio, USA, by DesignGroup (2009); and the Bullitt
Foundation Center in Seattle, Washington, USA, by Miller Hull (2012). Here, the teasing out of the
principles has gone so far that we cannot say that the building itself is bioinspired. In the Water
Cube, self-cleaning materials were used to cover the water bubble design. However, nothing
about the objects from living nature that inspired these materials can be said to inspire anything
else about the design. In fact, at best, this building could be said to fall into inspiration from non-
living nature, or, more properly, mimicry of non-living nature. For the Grange Audubon Society,
many wonderful environmental principles were incorporated, from materials to landscape.
However, there is no biologically derived inspiration that drives the design or creates a cohesive
whole out of the kit of parts. The Bullitt Foundation Center is another building that incorporates
incredible advances in green technology and green practices into the design. Its solar ‘hat’ that
extends beyond the traditional (and technical) bounds of the site provides sufficient energy to
supply the entire building, despite its site in cloudy Seattle. Further, it incorporates water cisterns,
passive solar lighting and heating, cooling via operable windows, and an increased emphasis on


rainwater collection
