We have to do here
with two paraxial thickenings in which mesoderm is being proliferated from endoderm. These thickenings are also visible in fig. 57 and on the left side in fig. 58, and they
can be traced forwards from fig. 56 into continuity with the prochordal plate, so
that in reality they have the form of paraxial bands, connected cranially by the pro-
chordal plate. Our last figure through this embryo (fig. 55, Plate 34) passes through the middle of
the prochordal plate, which is readily distinguishable from the columnar embryonal
endoderm adjoining its lateral margins by its more irregular character, and by the fact
that it consists of a thinner axial portion uniting two distinct lateral thickenings. These
latter are similar in character to the paraxial bands noted in fig. 56. They can be
traced caudally in the series into direct continuity with them, whilst cranially the
prochordal plate loses its bilateral character and appears as a single thickening.
