One further possible significance of the variation in size of the fibres is that they
innervate varying numbers of muscle fibres, and therefore that some require to be
larger in order to provide the necessary branches. It is indeed the case that the larger
fibres innervate the greater numbers of muscle fibres, and to give some idea of these
differences the pieces of muscle innervated by each giant fibre were separated as
accurately as possible, and weighed. As will be seen from the second column of
Table 1, the smallest fibre present (61) was estimated to innervate 0-4 g. of muscle
(including connective tissue, etc.) and the largest fibre (447), 10-2 g. In view of the
various uncertainties it has not been thought profitable to try to define the relationship
more closely. On general grounds it does not seem likely that increase in the number
of muscle fibres innervated would necessitate increase in the size of the nerve fibres.
The initial part of the axons of the second-order fibres is very much thinner than the
main trunk, a fact which by itself suggests that the significance of the large diameter
is that it ensures rapid conduction, and not that it provides for the maintenance of
the large mass of tissue which the fibre must innervate. In any case the large fibre
g.f.2a does not have to control large numbers of muscle fibres but only the relatively
few third-order giant-nerve fibres.

11. CLARIFICATIONS OF THE NEURON THEORY

The peculiar opportunities offered by the giant-fibre system of cephalopods enable
us to formulate a number of important propositions about the organization of the
nervous system, amplifying and clarifying the neuron theory. The main postulates
of that theory, emphasizing the anatomical, embryological, trophic and functional
independence of neurons, are usually true, but may be qualified and expanded by
