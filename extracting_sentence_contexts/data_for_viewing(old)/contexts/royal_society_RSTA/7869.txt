8—AHistory of the Problem

It is a well-known fact that long beams can be bent by terminal couples without
producing any anti-clastic curvature in them. In all such cases the displacements
are not in any way small, and the curvature produced by the applied couples is
considerable. Hence it is that the stress-distribution varies from that indicated by
Bernoutu-Evter theory. Ketyin and Tarr* have drawn attention to the problem
of the “ flexure of a broad very thin band (such as a watch spring) bent into a circle
of radius comparable with a third proportional to its thickness and breadth.”
Lamst has given an approximate solution of this problem based on the theory of small
strains. The drawback in the solution is that it cannot be applied to those physically
possible cases where u, 2, w are finite.

Lovey has shown that if the thickness of the plate is small enough, or the radius
of curvature great enough, the plate can be bent into a cylindrical form by two
