The larvee were reared in winter ata series of different temperatures, and it was
found that below about 13° they did not develop at all beyond the gastrula stage,
and remained chiefly at the bottom of the jar ; if, however, when they had been in
this condition for several days, they were warmed up to 15°, many of them
grew into moderately healthy plutei, The larvae reared at 13-15° were exactly like
those reared at the same temperature in March, while those grown at about 18°
were better developed and had a higher proportion of cross-bars and anterior
body-skeleton, but fewer double-arm bars, and finally the larvee reared at 20—22° were
in many cases like those obtained in summer. The highest development, however,
attained in December at 20-22° was not as good as that of the best larvae reared in
summer, and in some cases although grown at this temperature the plutei were weak,
with short arms, and a low percentage of Spherechinus features. This may be
accounted for by the facts that firstly, neither species was at its true breeding season,
and hence the larvee were less strongly developed, and secondly, the rather rapid rise
of temperature to which the eggs were subjected, viz., from about 11° at which the
urchins were living to 20° in the jars, was probably enough to reduce their vitality
considerably. That this explanation is sufficient to account for the difference between
the larvee reared in December at 18—22°, and those reared in summer, is indicated by
the fact that pure-bred larvee of both the parent species were smaller in the winter
than in the summer, although reared at the same temperatures. Temperature has on
the pure-bred larvee an effect similar to that observed on the hybrids, but it is less
marked, so that at 10-12° both Spherechinus and Strongylocentrotus gave typical

plutei, but especially in the case of the former they were very weakly developed,
while, as has been mentioned, the hybrid larvee remained at the gastrula stage at this
