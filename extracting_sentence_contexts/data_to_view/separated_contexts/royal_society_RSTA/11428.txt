No. 9 shows the general rise of Jevel due to the entry of the sphere. The rise at the
edge of the scale is about’3 millims., but the rise at the spout of the vessel is much
more marked, though this is at a greater distance from the place of impact, and the
liquid enveloping the sphere seems to rise very abruptly out of the flat surface on
this side. We think that all the facts point to rise of Jevel at great distances from
the impact even when the vessel is much wider. When the ivory sphere, which when dry and well polished gave the splash of
Series IV., was allowed to fall wet into the liquid, all other circumstances remaining
the same, the splash of Series VII. (Plate 7) was obtained, which from the very
first is entirely different. The wetting was effected by dipping the sphere into the
bowl of milky water in which it was to fall and then shaking off as much as possible
of the adherent liquid, but in all cases the splash quickly becomes unsymmetrical,
probably through the liquid during the fall drifting to one side of the sphere, indeed,
in all the figures from 4 onward, but especially in 4 and 5, there is seen a tendency
to behave as a smooth dry sphere on the left-hand side where convergent foldings
may (in the original photographs) be seen on the surface.
