“tube” of the tubular process.

The substance of the processes is very different from the substance of the cell. The
latter is solid and granular, the former is extremely transparent (compare HArcKEL,
loc. cit., figs. 6, 8, 10, 11, 12), and consists of two parts :—

(1.) Fine filaments running longitudinally; and suspended in

(2.) A more or less fluid plasm (Krieger, Joe. cit.). The junction between cell
substance and process substance is extremely abrupt. Similar tubular fibres enclosing

~ filaments are described by ScurerrerpecKER and Kossex in Petromyzon,* and the
S facts at present at our disposal warrant the suggestion that the filaments are the
5 structures which convey the nervous impulses.
— ‘The unit of the motor system of Astacus thus consists of the following parts :—
a, (1.) A single nerve cell which, from its histological characters, and relation to the
* blood stream, appears to be a highly metabolic structure ; and which is-removed by a
considerable length of nerve from the direct track of the nervous impulses.
©  (2.) A single nerve process from this cell which branches in a characteristic fashion,
5 and consists of a number of filaments, presumably processes of the cell, which are
2 suspended in a plasma.
@  (3.) The branches of this process, and, therefore, of the single nerve cell. These are
‘g very numerous, are distributed to the plexus of the ganglion and to a very large m mass
Sof muscle fibres.
