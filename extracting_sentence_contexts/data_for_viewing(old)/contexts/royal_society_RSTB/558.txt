We have already given our reasons for believing that certainly the losses, and
probably the gains also, shown in M. Drnirary’s experiments were too high. We
nevertheless, quite agree that there would be losses where he found losses, and that
there would be gains where he found gains. It is to be observed, however, that it was
under the conditions of arable culture, that is of artificially aérated soil, and with vege-
tation, that M. Drmtrar found great losses, whilst it is in wel] aérated soils, also with
vegetation, that M. Joutze finds such enormous gains.

It is further to be observed that the large gains shown in M. Jounin’s results were
obtained chiefly in the growth of buckwheat, and not with plants of the Leguminous
family which are reputed to be “ Nitrogen collectors.” From our own results, taken
together with known facts as to agricultural production, and the fertility of soils, it
may be confidently affirmed that such gains as M. Jouxte finds within a period of
about 14 months, do not take place, either with or without vegetation, in ordinary
soils, in ordinary practice.

4. The Experiments of Dr. B. E. Dirrze.u.

At the meeting of the Naturforscher-Versammlung at Magdeburg in 1884,
Dr. DierzeLt gave the results of experiments, the primary object of which was to
determine whether plants absorb combined nitrogen from the atmosphere by their
leaves ; but they equally afford evidence on the question whether they assimilate the
free nitrogen of the air. The plants selected were peas and clover, each of which he
grew under four conditions as to manuring. A garden soil, containing 0°415 per cent.
