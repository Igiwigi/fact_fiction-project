* There are oo primes in Y, and if we impose any linear condition on them this will be equivalent to

making them pass through a fixed point.

c; co-prime* with the given points. Hence in © all lines which meet four given planes
of V,° meet a fifth, and the five planes in question form a set of five associated planest
and correspond to five coprime points of ¢;. Any line of © meets just five such planes
of V,°. Now consider a prime II of S meeting c, in the five points P;,..., P;. The
Segre cubic locus corresponding to II contains the five associated planes of V,° corre-
sponding to the points P,,..., P;.{ It is in fact generated by all the lines which meet
any four and therefore the fifth of these planes; for such lines correspond to cubic
curves through P,, ... , P;, and just one of these curves passes through an arbitrary point
of Il. Any four points of ¢; determine a prime II ; so that there is just one Segre
cubic of the system YY which contains four given planes of V,°, and that is generated
by all the lines which meet those four planes. Recapitulating then: To points of cs
correspond, in X, a V,° of planes; to five points of cs lying in a prime correspond five
associated planes of V;°; and to the prime itself corresponds a Segre primal containing
these planes.§ and determined by any four of them.|| Also any line of = meets five planes of
V,° which are associated.

required to contain it, and to all points of it there must therefore correspond the same
