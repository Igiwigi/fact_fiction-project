we turn to the consideration of the large number of observed field-changes due to
discharges whose distances could not be determined. These are tabulated according
to the magnitude and sign of the field-changes. In the case of complex discharges
separate figures are given for the bigger component only and for both components.
The tables which follow include all observed field-changes whether the distance of the
discharge was known or not.

If the numbers for simple and complex discharges be added together the following
table may be constructed.

The general features of these tables are similar to those obtained when discharges
are classified according to distance. The greater number of discharges which is here
included, however, establishes the facts more definitely. The last row of figures in
Tables XIII and XIV, representing the most distant discharges, shows a preponderance
of negative field-changes.

Before discussing in detail the results given in Tables XI-XIV, it is of interest to
compare them with the results of some earlier unpublished observations which were
kindly supplied by Professor C. T. R. Wilson, These observations were made at
Cambridge with a capillary electrometer during the years 1920-4 inclusive. The
numbers of simple field-changes recorded in this period are given in Table XV.
