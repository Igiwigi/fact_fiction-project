The most obvious fact shown by this table is one which the study of the refraction
equivalents had long ago made familiar, z.¢., that in each family of elements the
refractivity increases with the atomic weight, though not in simple proportion to it. It is true that the existing figures for the refraction equivalents show many excep-
tions to this rule; but the figures themselves are so untrustworthy that anomalies do
not destroy the general effect of the evidence. The second, and perhaps more interesting, point is that the refractivities of the
different members of the same chemical family are, within the limits of experimental
error, related in the ratios of small integers.
