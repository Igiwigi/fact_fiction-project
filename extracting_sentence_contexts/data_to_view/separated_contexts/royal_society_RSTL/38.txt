Fermenting and Fiery Ingredients, none ſhould have
diſcovered a certain way of producing this great and
deſirable Effet. For though I will not queſtion the
veracity of the great Borichius, who declares to the
World, that he made his Oyl of Turpentine and Spirit
of Nitre to take Fire and Flame ; yet for my part, aſter
ſo many unſucceſsful Experiments made with: the great-
eſt Accuracy I could, I muſt ſtill own my incapacity
to-perform it : But if you add ſome drops of Balſam
of Sulphur to that Oyl of Turpentine, the Effe& will
then very certainly ſucceed, and your Mixture advance
_ to anaQual Flame. However it may prove as to this

laſt mentioned Mixture, the great variety of other Li-
quids that are made to kindle and produce flames, will
now put the Matter of Fact out of Queſtion, which I
am-told has been by many Experimentors doubted of.

A Strange Experiment of Exploſion and Accen=
fron made in Vacuo. F Shall venture here; to add one ſurprizing Effect of
I} this Fiery Mixture, which was done in the Preſence
of (everal Spectators. - |

We took half, a Dram of the Oyl of -Carui-Szeds,
and poured it into little Gally-Pot, and put a. Dram
of our Compound Spirit of Nitre in a ſmall Vial 'into

by the ſame Gally-Pot, and placed over it a Glaſs that held
= Three Pints upon Monſieur Papis's Exhauſting Engine,
2 and having ſoon cleared it of the Air, we 'turned up
= the Vial in Order to fee what Effect would enſue, 'in
5 this fort of Yacaum, upon this Mixture: But in the
E: twinkling-of an Eye the Receiver was blown1up, and
S the Mixture in a flame, which ſtupendious Phenomenon
S ſurprized and frightned us all.
