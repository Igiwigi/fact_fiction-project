described by population values where individual ants have
no other identity than either being active/inactive or located
in one of the two possible paths.

The two other examples provide an increasingly more
defined state for ants. When dealing with a number of
tasks that require a distribution of individuals performing
them, ants are represented by a Boolean vector and inter-
actions occur following a threshold function (as in standard
neural nets) but with a state-dependent choice of links. In
other words, in contrast with neurons in solid brains, there
is no predefined weight matrix but a state-dependent one.
This is in fact an especially important difference, along with
the fact that the attractors are given by populations of Boo-
lean strings and any ant can end up in one of them. The
fourth model makes a strong attempt to get closer to Hop-
fieldâ€™s picture, but is less realistic in terms of modelling real
case scenarios. In order to achieve that result, the model
requires incorporating chemical mediators along with the
correspondence matrix.

An important message from the previous examples is that
both liquid and solid brains share common descriptions
(at some level) such as the presence of threshold-like
phenomena. They also achieve attractor states but they are
