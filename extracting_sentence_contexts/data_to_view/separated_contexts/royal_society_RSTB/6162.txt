In this figure the epiphysis is directly above the paraphysis. Although DammMerMAN (1910) has a paper entitled ‘‘ Der Saccus vasculosus der
Fische ein Tiefeorgan,” nothing was observed in these deep sea fish to substantiate
such a viewpoint. In fact, the saccus in these fish is rather small. A description of the nucleus preopticus is not included in this paper, as nothing
new was observed. CHARLTON (1932) has written an excellent paper on this region,
including in his study some deep sea fish.
