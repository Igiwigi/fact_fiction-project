if there were any exception, it would be in the terrestrial species ; but no, they are,
when first hatched, incapable of living out of water with swimming members; hence
the parent is impelled by instinct to seek that, element for its progeny which Nature
has designed for the whole of the tribe to which they belong. Having lived amongst
West Indian islands, where these facts were constantly before him, neither he, nor any
other person, could invent any plausible reason for this curious piece of economy.‚Äù

In the fifth and last place are to be noticed Mr. Tzowyson's general statements.
In the Addenda to his second number he states that he has had a confirmation of
his views in one of the West Indian land Crabs, and in some other of our most widely
Separated native genera, authorizing his previous assertion that the greater number
of the Crustacea do actually undergo transformations, of which, in addition to the
facts adduced in his first memoir, further instances will be given in future memoirs.
On the wrapper of his fourth number he has given a list of some of these promised
memoirs, in which we find the Paguri, the Shrimp and Prawn, the genera Porcellana,
Gegarcinus, Hydrodomus, and other genera of land Crabs and Pinnotheres, all stated
to undergo various remarkable metamorphoses ; and in the nineteenth number of
the Zoological Journal he states that the newly hatched young of the following Bra-
ehyurous genera, Cancer, Carcinus, Portunus, Eryphia, Gegarcinus, Thelphusa ?,
Pinnotheres, and Inachus, have been ascertained to be Zoes by himseJf; and that the
following Macrourous genera are likewise subject to metamorphosis, viz. Pagurus,
Porcellana, Galathea, Crangon, Palemon, Homarus, Astacus. !

Such are the yarious circumstances upon which Mr. TromrsoN has built his theory
of metamorphosis. I have given them at rather an inconvenient, but not an unne-
