11. The infant Brackionus 8wims rather feebly at first; but, acquiring vigour as it
Qgoes, presently darts along with amazing swiftness, 80 that the eye can scarcely follow
Sit, When several of the young were hatched, they whirled and shot round and round
She live-box in which they were enclosed, in the most headlong manner, and were every
Zinstant coming into contact with the parent, when, almost invariably, the course of the
Aittle creature would be arrested, and it would play around the body of the mother, or
=grasp with its pincer-like toes her cilia. As I have already said, I had at that time no
Fotion of these being males, having seen no offspring but these produced from this
-Zpecies. I had, however, seen the birth of several young of Brachionus urceolaris, which
were exactly like the parent, whereas these were very dissimilar ; a cireumstance which
Zexcited my curiosity, as did also the fact that both eggs and young were notably smaller
-2than those of Þ. urceolaris, in proportion to the adult. The actual dimensions of the
eggs in question were z4gth of an inch in the longer diameter ; of the new-born male,
Seboth ; of the parent, 45th, exclusive of the foot.

S 12. I $hall not here describe the structure-of the male, because I shall presently have
Boccasion to recur to the species again, in recording observations made with the advan-
"Stage of more experience.
£& 13. In April 1850 I first 8aw eggs of two different dimensions, attached to the same
Yopecies. This was Brackionus rubens, several specimens of which carried each seven or
Zeight small eggs (fig. 3), measuring 335th of an inch in length, while others carried few
Seggs (two or three at most), nearly twice as large, viz. 435th of an inch in length. One
Aof the latter, under slight pressure, freed prematurely a young one, enveloped in a spined
