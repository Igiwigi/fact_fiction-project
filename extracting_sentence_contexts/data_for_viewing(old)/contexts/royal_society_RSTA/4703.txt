This evolution equation can make sense in the set of probability measures depending on the 1g
regularity of the potential W. However, if the potential is singular at the origin the well-posedness acy
only happens in L? spaces (see [60,68,69] for more details). For steady configurations, we expect :s
Vw =0 on the support of 1, owing to the formal energy dissipation identity for solutions, i.e. :

where ju; is any solution at time t of (4.6) and y= W * ju; its associated potential. Therefore, the :3
points on the support of a local minimizer jx of the energy E should correspond to critical points a
of its associated potential yy. This fact is made rigorous in the following proposition. [3
