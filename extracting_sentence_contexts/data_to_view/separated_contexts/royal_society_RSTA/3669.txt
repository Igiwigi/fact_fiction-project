We see theretore that the stretch reaches its limiting value with very great
rapidity. Ata distance from the point of application of the load equal to about 14
times the greatest breadth 2b of the bar the error in the stretch is only 3/1000. In
fact the stretch begins to get near its limiting value at a much earlier stage than
this, the error being less than 10 per cent. at a distance from the load of about halt
the greatest breadth. We find therefore that in this case also the distribution ot the load becomes
practically indifferent as soon as we come to distances from the load which are of the
same order of magnitude as the greatest dimension of the cross-section.
