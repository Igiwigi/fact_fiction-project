6. We can now formulate the question: Of the permutations of the first 2
numbers, how many have a descending specification denoted by a given composition
of the number x? Whatever the answer, it is clear that the same answer must, in
general, he given for three other compositions, viz., the three others associated with
the zig-zag graph. In fact, from

314592768 of specification 211221,

we derive 867295413 " 2241:

and from these two by changing the number m into n—m-+1,
796518342 of specification 1422,

22112
and so forth. 243815679 ” 122112

Tn two cases there are two associated compositions instead of four, viz. :—
(i) When the composition reads the same as its inverse (that is the same from
left to right as from right to left),
(ii) When the conjugate and the inverse are identical, as in 221, whose
conjugate is 122.
