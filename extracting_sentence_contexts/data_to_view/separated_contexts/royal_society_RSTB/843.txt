These, as will be remembered, arise from the dorsal and external surface of the
inter-ganglionic cord, a variable but short distance posterior to the ganglion. As was
pointed out before, they each consist of two parts derived respectively from the {
ganglion above and the ganglion below. This fact is only demonstrable by sections,
since simple dissection merely reveals the fact that they arise a very short distance
posterior to, but in very close connection with the second abdominal ganglion. I
have examined these nerves in detail in the first five abdominal ganglia. Each nerve
is composed of from ten to thirteen tubular fibres, which vary in size from 12 to 13 p.
