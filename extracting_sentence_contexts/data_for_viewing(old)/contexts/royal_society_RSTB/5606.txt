in the midbrain, has no relationships discernible in this material and no recognisable
morphological homology, except, as suggested by Kapprrs (in a private communication),
that such a nucleus is found in a similar position in the elephant. The only character
which the two beasts share is the peculiar development of the nose (soft, flat, beak-like
proboscis) of Platypus and the trunk of the elephant. Such a correlation, however,
lies only in the imagination of the writer.

At the present writing it appears impossible to homologise the nuclei of the
oculomotor nerve of Platypus with those in the classical descriptions (KAPPERS, 1920,
vol. 2, p. 549; Brouwer, 1918; Hunrer, 1923). There is in Ornithorhynchus no
need for a nucleus of convergence, and yet there is a slender medial group of cells
placed rostrally, whose axones may or may not contribute to the nerve trunk. The
fact that the majority of the axones of both the posterior lateral and antero-lateral
components decussate is slightly confusing. The medial dorsal division which lies quite
cephalward may be the autonomic or Edinger-Westphal nucleus, if position and relative
size of cells be a criterion. But what part the longish nucleus, medio-ventral to the
medio-dorsal cell-group, plays in the physiology of the third nerve, the writer cannot
suggest.

Then, again, in Platypus in the fourth nucleus, lateral to the typical large motor
cells, is a group of smaller cells whose axones join those of the larger. These smaller
cells are like nothing else described in this region in any other brain. Of course, it
is possible that they may be cells belonging to the ever elusive proprioceptive
mechanism.
