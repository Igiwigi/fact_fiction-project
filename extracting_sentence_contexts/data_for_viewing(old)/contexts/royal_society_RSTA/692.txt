the MutS dataset into four groups, as shown in table 1. We observe that the more thermostable
the protein, the easier it is to destabilize with point mutations. Indeed, the mean ATm for the
point mutations introduced in thermostable proteins (Tm < 50°C) is 3°C smaller compared with
those of hyperthermostable proteins (Tm > 80°C). This effect is increased to about 4°C for the
mutations introduced in the protein core due to the fact that thermostable proteins have usually
a more compact structure. Instead, in the surface region, the difference between thermostable
and mesostable proteins is reduced, even though the difference in AT remains significant:
about 1.5°C.

We then used the protein-level predictor HoTMuSiC introduced in §4 to evaluate the changes
in stability of these 1600 mutations. As shown in table 1, the mean AT m values are almost identical
to the experimental ones. Only the root mean square deviations are smaller than the observed.
ones.

Motivated by this very good agreement between experimental and predicted values, we
started a large-scale analysis employing HoTMuSiC in view of finding other indications about
the non-universality of the AT distribution. Indeed, the results shown in table 1 have to be
