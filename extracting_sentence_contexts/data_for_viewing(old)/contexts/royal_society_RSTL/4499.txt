The specimen figured, Plate XXIX. fig. 7, appears to ime to afford coneclusive evi-
dence on the points in dispute. By a reference to my former paper, it will be seen that
the longitudinal ridges, which are always present on the distal end of the phragmocone
of the Belemnoteuthis, are regarded by those observers who contend that the latter
belong to Belemnites, as plaits, or folds, originating from fracture and lateral com-
pression. In the fossil before us these ridges are entire and well-defined ; two are
Situated on the ventral and one on the dorsal region. Fig. 7* is a transverse section,
enlarged four diameters, in which are shown the form of the ridges and the radiated
structure of the solid part of the phragmocone: I scarcely need observe, that in the
true Belemnite the cone is chambered to the extreme apex. These characters will
remind the palzontologist of the very analogous organization of the Beloptera of the
tertiary strata, alluded to in my former memoir*. In fact it is now proved that the
Belemnoteuthis (as was originally suggested by Mr. CranxinG Pearce and Mr, Cun-
NINGTON) possessed an osselet of a radiated structure containing a chambered siphun-
culated cone, but without an extended rostrum or guard ; thus forming an interesting
transition to the Belemnite, from which it is generically distinetf. From the facts
before us, our knowledge of the organization of the genus Belemnites comprises the
following structures :â€”

1. The investing periostricum or capsule, which enveloped the osselet, and extend-
ing upwards, constituted the external parietes of the receptacle.

2. 'The Osselet, characterized by its radiated structure, composed of trihedral pris-
matic fibres, which terminated distally in a solid rostrum having an alveolus or conical
