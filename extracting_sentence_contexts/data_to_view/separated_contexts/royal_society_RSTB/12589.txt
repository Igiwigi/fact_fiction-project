The resulting caudal fragment (comprising in any case, see figure 9. This suggests that the aggregation of
PMs, dPMs and few pEs) moves towards the embryoâ€™s tail primordium fragments is mainly regulated by adhesive inter-
owing to the polarized expression of SDFla receptors, and actions and FGF10-signalling, which here overcome SDFla-
owing to dPM agents that both chemotactically move towards related velocity components. This is further confirmed by the
and push forward PMs, in addition to drag the few pEs by fact that the resulting aggregate presents a more compact and
adhesion. In the case of a primordium ablated in three frag- rounded morphology, and that it is not able to migrate along
ments, see figure 9a,c, too high cell sensitivity to FGF10 drives the stripe of SDF 1a even if the polarized expression of receptors
dPM individuals in the caudal fragment to move towards and Cxer4/Cxcr7 occurs (figure 9a,b). On the other hand, too high
