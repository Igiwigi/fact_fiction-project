states were no longer represented in terms of orbital motion, but only in terms of energy
values, which would change discontinuously and acausally, changes statistically predicted by
Heisenberg’s scheme. Part of the formal mathematical architecture of the scheme was provided
by the equations of classical mechanics, formally adopted by Heisenberg, by the mathematical
correspondence principle. Classical variables, however, would not give correct predictions, and
had to be replaced by new variables, which were complex-valued matrix variables (essentially
operators in Hilbert spaces over complex numbers) of a type never used in physics previously,
but which would convert into classical variables (functions of real variables) in the classical limit.

Two qualifications are in order. First, I am not saying that Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics
was, or that QM or QFT is, (only) quantum information theory. Heisenberg was concerned with
how fundamental quantum objects and processes work, even though these workings defy being
represented, which fact is an effect of these workings. The information at stake was still about
them, rather than was part of information processing or communication by using quantum
The concept of complementarity, thus formulated, reflects Bohr’s later works, from 1929 on, where the concept is

exemplified, in particular, by the position and the momentum measurements, thus correlatively to the uncertainty relations.

technology, experimental and mathematical. But then, as will be seen in §5, quantum information
theory, too, may serve the purposes of fundamental physics, rather than only aim at theorizing
quantum information processing between devices. My point is that, in Heisenberg’s approach,
QM contains a constitutive quantum-informational structure within it.
