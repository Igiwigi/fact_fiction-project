ecosystems and eco-evolutionary dynamics is important
because our ability to articulate these concepts circumscribes
the ways in which we are able to frame hypotheses and
conduct empirical studies. Herein, we define and provide
examples of five urban disturbances: habitat modification,
social interaction, biotic interaction, heterogeneity and novel
disturbances [2]. We review recent empirical evidence that
these disturbances can drive phenotypic trait changes in
urban organisms. In our review of empirical evidence, we are
broadly inclusive of evidence of phenotypic changes linked to
urban anthropogenic disturbances. Such changes create the
potential for eco-evolutionary feedback, if the observed changes
are in fact genetic. However, we caution that phenotypic change
is not synonymous with evolutionary change; urban-driven
changes in the attributes of populations, communities and
ecosystems influence phenotypes via selection and plasticity

[9]. Furthermore, some phenotypic changes are adaptive, and
some are maladaptive responses to environmental disturbances.
Throughout this review, we will indicate phenotypic change
examples for which there is a known genetic basis for the trait
or for which there is evidence via common garden studies,
versus examples for which the genetic basis of a phenotypic
trait change is unknown. We conclude with theoretical impli-
cations of how changes in functional traits may affect
