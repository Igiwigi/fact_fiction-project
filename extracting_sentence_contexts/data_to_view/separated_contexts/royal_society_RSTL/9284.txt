Sn each of these is a resolved part of the vibrations yg, 9, and 11, 9 we geb three
SZdditional equations, the last of which, however, is the same as the second of the
Former ones and there result, consequently, but four equations from which the four
gluantities, namely, the three intensities T'q, Ty, T';, and the azimuth of Ti, are to be
\Aletermined. It is remarkable that whether we assumed or no that £{=7 it is here
BSutroduced. That is, however, no proof that it is wrong to omit it, as in FRESNEL's
Snethod of obtaining the intensities of the reflected and refracted rays, for the fact of
Sts turning up independently shows that there is something at leasb debateable about
ER and as I shall have cause to omit this equation as leading to inconvenient results in
@ snbsequent part of my paper, I thought it well to mention that there is something
curious about it even here. These equations are those long ago given by M'CULLAGH
in the *Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,” vol. xxi., to solve the problem of
-— aystalline reflection and refraction, and from which he deduces his beautiful theorem of
- the polar plane and thus marvellously simplifies an extremely complicated problem.
