same form whether complete block is present or not. An experiment performed for
the purpose is illustrated by Plate 18, figs. 18 and 14. In this animal a clean cut
severed the right division of the bundle, and the usual curves were subsequently
recorded (fig. 13); a clamp was now placed on the bundle stem and tightened until -
complete block was obtained (fig. 14). Despite the dissociation of auricular and
ventricular rhythms, the form of ventricular complex remained practically unchanged.
Such slight change as occurred is no more than is observed from time to time in an
experiment in which the curves are repeatedly taken without further experimental
interference. The uniformity of distribution to a given ventricle, when the contra-
lateral bundle division is not conducting, before and after the production of auriculo-
ventricular dissociation, is readily to be explained upon the usual assumption that in
A-V dissociation the impulses spring from the bundle itself immediately below the
seat of damage. Asa matter of fact, full justification of the primary experiment
lies in its end result: the algebraic relation between dextrogram, levogram and
bigram. Such accurate fitting cannot be coincidental and can be explained only by
the hypothesis suggested.

SEPARATE CONSIDERATION OF THE LEVOGRAM AND DEXTROGRAM.

We owe to Erprycer and Rorupercer* the statement that lesions of one or
other division of the 4A-V bundle produce profound modifications of the natural
electrocardiogram in dogs. Their general statement and their account of the form
of change has been accepted widely by a number of workers upon the physiology
and pathology of the heart. [ have accepted their general conclusions, and have
had less hesitation in so doing because they have seemed to me to harmonise with a
