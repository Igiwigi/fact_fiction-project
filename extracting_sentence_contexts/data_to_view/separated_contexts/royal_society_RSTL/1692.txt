Plate XXIV. represents the mean result of the whole of the obseryations. The mean variations of the first five hours are referred to a general mean de-
rived from all obseryations made continuously from 1 a.m. to midnight ; those
of the next two hours are referred to one derived from all obseryations made

* I am not aware that any series of observations has before exhibited this singular result, and de-
veloped the important influence which the diameter of the tube, and the nature of the fluid column
exercise oyer the changes which the atmospheric pressure ought to produce in the barometer, Dr. ProvT has since informed me, that he has found a barometer made with sulphuric acid move with
much greater freedom than the ordinary mercurial barometers,—a fact which he considers only to be
explained by the greater mobility of the molecules of the liquid under these circumstances, and which
strikingly corroborates this result of my observations. MDCCCXXXII, 46G

from 6 4.M. to midnight; the mean variation at 8 4.. is referred to a general
mean derived from all observations made from that hour till midnight ; and
the variations at each of the subsequent hours are referred to a mean of all
observations made from 9 a.m. till midnight*.
