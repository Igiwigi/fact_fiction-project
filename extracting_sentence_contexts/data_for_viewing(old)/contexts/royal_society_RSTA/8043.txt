that we can only say that both equatorial spots, the small diffuse spot near the centre
of mean spacing about 27 A., and the (probably complex) spot of spacing 9-8 A., could
conceivably supply the spacing required.

Fig. 26 (A) and (B), Plate 9, shows an atomic model of part of the «-keratin system
of folded main-chains linked by side-chains, (A) being a view in the direction [001] and
(B) in the direction [100], Again no significance must be attached to the particular
side-chains used (they are of equal lengths in this model and correspond, as a matter of

fact, to cystine “rungs ”’—see below). Fig. 26(C), Plate 9, shows the same mode
pulled out into the $-form and viewed in the direction [100]; it is the counterpart
of fig. 26 (D), in which the side-chains have been made of different lengths. These
models, in addition to illustrating the arguments brought forward above, serve also,
since the $-models were derived simply by extension of the corresponding «-models,
to bring out another important point, that the transformation of a-keratin to 6-keratin
does not necessarily involve the rupture of direct cross-linkages. All that appears to
happen when one model is transformed to the other is a sequence of oscillations about
various bonds, though undoubtedly (see below) departure from the «-form must give
rise to a system of very complex stresses and strains. We have here an interesting
demonstration of how it becomes possible for hair to preserve its elastic properties
after innumerable extensions and contractions, and how it is that the X-ray photo-
graphs retain their definition throughout.
