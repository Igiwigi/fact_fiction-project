are satisfied by the following three systems of contemporaneous
values :— p
(1) «,=90, A,=z=+48,

(2) Þ,=90, oj === 10, Ns (d.)

and if T,, T,, and T, be the values of T corresponding respectively to these systems of
values of «,, 3,, and y,, we have

N=HKB, —0CY, T=HA,—C,Y, T;=HA;—B,Y- If A,, B,, C, be taken, as they always may be, in order of magnitude, T, will mani-
festly be the greatest of these values of T. It is in fact, as shown in the memoir
referred to, the only value which satisfies all the conditions of a maximum. The corre-
sponding values of «,, 3, and y,, which determine the corresponding position of the
plane s, are those given by the second system of (4.). Now Þ, is the angle between the
normal to s and the axis of y; and since it is here =90s, the normal to 8 mnst lie in
the plane of &z, and the plane s itself must pass through the axis of y. Moreover,
since the corresponding values of «, and y, are each +45*, this plane may have two
positions, in both of which it bisects the angle between the coordinate planes of zy and
y2, these positions being on opposite sides of the plane of yz.
