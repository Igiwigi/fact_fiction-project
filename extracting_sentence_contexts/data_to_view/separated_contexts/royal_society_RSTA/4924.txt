The equations of 14 are

If the lines intersect, the first five equations must be simultaneously true. Hence,
eliminating # and z, we see that the equations

Similarly it can be proved that each o

We have now proved that of the twenty-seven lines on the cubic surface, each
cuts ten of the others; furthermore we have shown which line cuts which others.
