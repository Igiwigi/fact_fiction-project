The parts were exposed by operation and extensive cicatricial tissue found. The
fifth nerve was isolated above the scar, and traced down to the plexus. The scar was
cut out and the nerve drawn together. He states that the proximal end was small

in comparison to the distal. Improvement followed this operation, flexion of the
forearm and abduction of the arm being regained.


PARALYSED MUSCLES BY MEANS OF NERVE ANASTOMOSIS. 389

In this case, although the fifth root was found divided and was sutured, there was
sear tissue also found and there is no proof that this had not involved the sixth nerve
also, which might recover after its removal. Also the fact that the central end of
the fifth was found small in comparison with the distal end throws doubt on the
accuracy of the observation, as central ends of ununited nerves are not less in thick-
ness than their peripheral ends, but if there is any difference it is in the opposite
direction.

The more important features of the plexus made out by the investigations already
mentioned are as follow.

The great majority of the muscles supplied through the brachial plexus are
supplied by several roots. This was pointed out by Forcur and Lannecrice.
SHERRINGTON also, as already mentioned, calls attention to the absence of paralysis
on sectioning the fifth or sixth or eighth cervical or first dorsal, and he also states
