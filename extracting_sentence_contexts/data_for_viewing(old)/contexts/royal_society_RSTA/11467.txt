E The irregularities apparent in the data for some of the aneroids are not surprising,
A in view of the fact that the average creep recorded in the fourth week was only
‘013 of an inch.

The mean results agree well with the single term formula (7).

The next set of data I have utilised are given on Mr. Wuymper’s p. 19. They
refer to three aneroids—distinct from those of Table XLV.—exposed for eight weeks
to the pressure of 16 inches. In these the increase of creep can be fairly traced up
to the end of the sixth week. The individual aneroids show somewhat irregular
behaviour. I give the mean results, obtained in the same way as the corresponding
results in our last table. ‘“ 1w” stands for “ one week’s creep,’ and so on.
