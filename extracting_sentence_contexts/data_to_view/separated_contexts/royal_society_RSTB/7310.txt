In spite of the unsatisfactory
nature of Jungersen’s material his description of the cartilages is very nearly correct and
agrees closely with the conditions found in the fresh specimens dissected in the present
study. His chief omission was due to his failure to find the rather small second dorsal
terminal piece (Td2), but he was aware that this cartilage was probably present in the
intact clasper and mentions that he thought it was probably similar to the corresponding
piece in Lamna. It is, in fact, considerably smaller proportionally than in that species, but
its articulation with the distal end of the dorsal marginal cartilage and the free edge of the
proximal part of the dorsal terminal piece is homologous. Several authors have studied the comparative anatomy of the skeleton of the clasper in
the elasmobranchs, and have gone into considerable detail in naming the various cartilages
and finding their homologies in different species. The work of Gegenbaur (1870), Petri
(1878) and Davidoff (1879) was reviewed and much extended by Jungersen (1898, 1899),
whose monograph of 1899 forms an admirable treatise on the subject; it may be questioned
whether the elaboration of Jungersen’s work by Huber (1901) is any real improvement.
