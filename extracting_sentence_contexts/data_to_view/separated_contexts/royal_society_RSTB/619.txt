This is the antero-lateral; it degenerates on the
same side above a hemisection. In my opinion no sufficient evidence has been
brought forward by Gowers for his views with regard to the origin of this tract from
fibres coming from the opposite side of the cord; nor by Epinaer for his view that these
fibres come from cells of the posterior horn of the opposite side, the nerve processes of
which decussate over in the anterior commissure. In fact, like the fibres of the direct
cerebellar tract, they appear to me to come from cells of the same side. The experi-
ments of Gorcu and Horstry support this view. The electrical reaction of the lateral
column of the same side on stimulation of a posterior root is four times that of the
