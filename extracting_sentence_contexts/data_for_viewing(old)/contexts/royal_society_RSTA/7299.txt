The dependence of dV/d/ on the film thickness is more complicated, because 4) itself
depends on x. This may be seen qualitatively by considering a film which is thick compared
with the characteristic absorption thickness; the majority of the radiation is absorbed at
the surface of such a film, the rest of the film acting only as a conductor in parallel and

thus decreasing the overall responsivity. This problem will be discussed in more detail in
the following part (Simpson); it is sufficient here to mention that dV/d/ is maximum for
a film of vanishing thickness. The practical problem of the optimum thickness is, however,
further complicated by the fact that the noise necessarily increases as the linear dimensions
are decreased, so that it is not profitable to decrease the thickness beyond a certain limit.

Although the responsivity is the first important characteristic of any detector, at low
intensities of illumination, the noise is equally important. Noise may arise from three main
sources:

(1) Johnson noise, controlled by the resistance and temperature of the film
¢,= (4k TRAS)*.

(2) Current noise, ¢,, which is generally lower at high frequencies, and increases as
some unknown positive power of the current.
