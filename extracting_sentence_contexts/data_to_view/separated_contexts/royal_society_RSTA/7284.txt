In fact, however, it can be seen from the table in §2@, which shows the range
of x/y encountered in the ionosphere, that the condition is likely to be well satisfied along
much of the whistler path. Whistlers, as stated earlier (§5), are found to obey the linear /~! against ¢ law, and thus
the dispersion theory of their origin is confirmed. The fact that the whistlers are not pure
tones can be explained by assuming that their waves travel from source to observer not by
a single path but by a range of paths, each producing a different dispersion. The intercepts of the /~! against ¢ graphs of the long whistlers on the time axis were always
found to coincide with the times of occurrence of their preceding atmospheric clicks, but
unfortunately this result cannot be regarded as confirming that their path is dispersive

along the whole of its length, since the probable errors of the estimated positions of the
intercepts correspond to considerable distances at the velocity of light.

(c) The differences between long and short whistlers and their associated whistler trains

According to our theory the ionospheric path of the long whistlers is twice that of the short
whistlers, so that they should be twice as much dispersed. This is what is observed ($6).
