We have had opportunities of examining the structure of the tail of Ceratodus
Protopterus in dissected specimens in the Cambridge Museum. The vertebral x
runs to the ends of the tail without showing any signs of becoming dorsally flexe
At some distance from the end of the tail the fin-rays are 8upported by what a
apparently segmented spinous prolongations of the neural and hemal arches. \
dorsal elements are placed above the longitudinal dorsal cord, and occupy therefo
the game position as the independent elements of the neural arches of Lepidoster
They are therefore to be regarded as homologous with the dorsal fin-supports 0
interspinous bones of other types. The corresponding ventral elements are therefor
also to be regarded as interspinous bones.

In view of the fact that the fin-supports, whenever their development has hee;
observed, are found to be formed independently of the neural and hwmal arches,
may fairly assume that this is also true for what we have identified as the interspinoy
elements in the Dipnoi.

The interspinous elements become gradually shorter as the end of the tail it
approached, and it is very difficult, from a simple examination of dissected specimens
to make out how far any of the posterior fin-rays are supported by the hamal arches
only. To this question we shall return, but we may remark that, although there is a”
prolongation backwards of the vertebral axis beyond the last interspinous elements,
composed it would seem of the coalesced neural and hemal arches bub without the
notochord, yet by far the majority of the fin-rays which constitute the apparent caudal”
fin are supported by interspinous elements.
