Why should we consider string theory, instead of other alternative approaches to a
quantum description of gravity? We have of course many possible answers to this question but,
in my opinion, there is a very simple—and compelling—reason: for a quantized string, gravity is
not an ‘optional’ ingredient to be possibly included into the theory; it is an interaction necessarily
predicted by the string model at the quantum level. Let us briefly recall, in fact, that an extended object like a string corresponds, dynamically,
to a constrained system, whose motion has to be consistently described not only in terms of the
appropriate Eulero—-Lagrange equations, but also imposing a set of constraints to be satisfied at
any point along the string trajectory. When the string is quantized such constraints are represented
by an infinite (discrete) series of operators (the Virasoro operators), and the Hilbert space of
the physical states is formed by (all and only) those states annihilated by the application of the
Virasoro operators. And the constraint corresponding to the lowest order operator imposes on
the states the mass-shell condition, determining the allowed energy levels of the string spectrum.
