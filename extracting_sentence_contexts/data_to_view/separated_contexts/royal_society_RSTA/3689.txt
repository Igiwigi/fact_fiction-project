The next column gives the error dR in ohms of each separate resistance of the main
dial in terms of the mean of the whole, deduced from equations (1) by the aid
of (2) and (3). The fourth column gives the correction dn in ohms to the reading at
each point. This correction is equal to the sum of the errors of all the coils up
to the point considered, subject only to a small correction, called the “ vernier-
correction,” to allow for the fact that the next two coils are shunted by the vernier
dial. The value of the vernier-correction is given by the following expression—

Vernier-correction to reading n = — n (‘38 — 3dR,,,, — 3dR,,,,)/400. This correction is often negligible when is small, but sometimes reaches ‘5 or °6
of an ohm near the higher readings.
