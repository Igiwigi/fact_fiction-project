As for the Virgin’s cloak, its decorative patterns show the presence of smalt—the blue-glass
pigment whose main element, cobalt, came from Saxony, the only major source of cobalt minerals
in Europe until the beginning of the eighteenth century—over a white layer, bathed by a very
thin ultramarine layer, following a pictorial tradition that would last even until the eighteenth
century. Francisco Pacheco, the famous Spanish painter and treatise writer, suggested that he
would not endorse the ‘bathed blues’ unless made with ultramarine, whereas Palomino de Castro
would advise that the ultramarine should only be used for glazing or painting over any other blue
pigment [27]. This is the technique that can be seen in our sample. In this case, it appears that the
ultramarine was applied with a small brush over in a final step.

As for the pigment itself, the elemental composition of the ultramarine layer obtained by SEM-—
EDS and the identification of wollastonite in the Raman spectrum were helpful in the assignment
of the mineral nature of the pigment, which is also in accordance with the fact that the polychromy
was manufactured in 1583. Lapis lazuli was a very expensive pigment obtained from lazurite, a
mineral whose best ores could be found in Afghanistan [19]. Early-modern Spanish art treatises
warned about the scarceness of this rich pigment, whereas commercial documents evidenced


that its trading started diminishing since the fifteenth century within the European milieu [28]. | 10 |
Francisco Pacheco would say that the lapis lazuli ‘was neither used in Spain, nor did the painters

have enough to use’, although there are some testimonies of trading practices through the city of “3
Venice [29]. In our sample, the possibility of an Afghan origin of the ultramarine blue is remote, 78
owing to these facts, and makes us consider that it could have a native origin. In fact, by the <
beginning of the eighteenth century, some lapis lazuli ores were registered in the Chilean Andes : Zs
