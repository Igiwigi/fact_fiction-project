The co-efficient of expansion, the elastic limit and plasticity of the bodies of the
grains and the delayed solidification) are directly dependent on the molecules and
atoms. It is therefore not surprising that in a case which is relatively so simple as
that of gold the influence of the atomic volume of the added elements can be directly
observed. Furthermore, the relation between the mechanical properties of the metals
and the atomic volume of the dissolved impurities is an experimental fact. We can
now explain the greater part of the apparent exceptions. The exceptional behaviour
of indium is explained by the presence of a cement, and that of lithium and of
aluminium by the development of secondary crystallization.* But as the conversion
of heat into work is effected in the steam engine by a series of intermediate stages,
so here also a more or less complex mechanism intervenes between the extreme terms
which are in relation to each other.
