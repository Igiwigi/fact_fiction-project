for the same in 1866. Another important factor as influencing the transparency must
not be overlooked, viz. the presence of finely divided solid particles which floating about
produce the phenomenon. of atmospheric opalescence. 'This, taken in connexion with
the well known fact of the greater velocity of the winds in spring than in autumn,
thus increasing the quantity of these floating particles in the spring, points to an
explanation of the high autumnal and low yernal chemical intensity. Parr IT,â€”THE PARA OBSERVATIONS.

,
&X Our knowledge concerning the distribution of the chemically active rays on the earth's
Eurface is as yet very limited, and any conclusions with respect to the intensity of the
emical rays in the tropics have been, up to the present time, based upon the vague and
satisfactory statements of photographers. According to photographic observations it
Fould appear that in advancing from England towards the equator the difficulty of
taining good pictures is increased, and more time is said to be required to produce
He ame effect upon a sensitive film under the full blaze of a tropical swn than in the
oomier atmosphere of London*, It is likewise statedF that in Mexico, where the
ht is very intense, from twenty minutes to half an hour was required to produce pho-
aphic effects which in England occupy but a minute; and it is said that travellers
gaged in copying the antiquities of Yucatan have on several occasions abandoned the
$e of the photographic camera and taken to their sketch-books.
