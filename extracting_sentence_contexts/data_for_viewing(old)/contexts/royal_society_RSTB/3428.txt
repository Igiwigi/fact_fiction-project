PARATHYROID GLANDS THROUGHOUT VERTEBRATES. 107

From the very wide variations found in different specimens of the same species, and
from the feeding experiments described below, we must conclude that the proportion
between vesicular tissue and intervesicular tissue varies under different physiological
conditions.

B. Parathyroid.—The parathyroid in the pigeon differs strikingly in its general
appearance from the corresponding structure in other animals. But this difference
appears to be simply due to the fact that the epithelial cells contain an abundance of
fat, and that they become extensively vacuolated during the process of preparation
for the microscope. Unlike the parathyroids of reptiles, those of birds appear to
have no lumen in the masses of cells (Plate 12, fig. 11, pthyr.).

y. Post-branchial body.—In close relationship with, and in the same region as, the
parathyroid we find a body having an extraordinarily complicated structure. It is
obviously of epithelial origin and nature. It is composed largely of structures which
at first sight resemble small arteries, but whose walls are made up entirely of
concentrically placed spindle-shaped cells (Plate 12, fig. 11, ¢.c.), and projecting into
the lumen are irregular cells, lining the tubules. The rest of this body appears
to be built of structures identical with the various well-known forms of Hassa.t’s
corpuscles of the thymus. There is a mass of this tissue in the centre of the para-
