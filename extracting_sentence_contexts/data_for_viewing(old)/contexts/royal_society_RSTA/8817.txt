type L, the value of B is 145-7 lb. (inch). Neglecting the effect of the wood, suppose
that the lead plug is x inches further forward. » In such a case

(2.21) B= 145:7 41-92.
If, moreover, / is the distance of the centre of gravity from the base in inches, then
(2.22) 1 = 4-727-40-1172.

The altered position of the centre of gravity can therefore be recovered by
calculation, if the altered value of B. can be deduced from the observations. This is,
in fact, the case (see § 4.1), so that even for shells of type IL. the dynamical constants
of the shells after firing are satisfactorily certain.

§ 2.3. Possible Disturbing Factors.

There are two further possible causes of error which we haye not yet mentioned.
These are (1) the wind, and (2) the impulsive action between the shell and the card.

2.31. The Effect of Wind.—Since we are studying the motion of the shell under the
force system impressed by the air, we are concerned solely with the motion of the
projectile relative to the air, but we can only observe, by means of jump cards, the
motion of the projectile relative to the ground.
