and rather completely cleaned of overlying tissue ; one point of a strong though sm
pair of scissors was then inserted carefully under the left edge of the last vertebra rt
one, and the lamina cut, The rest, as far as required, were then easily divided |

tending the incision, and then the right-hand side (that of the nerve-roots used)
proceeded with. In fact the procedure was that described by C, Eckarp (1).
| one experiment a short incision parallel to the coccyx was made, exposing
he four lowest nerves outside the canal, and then all but the desired one was
ded. This method, that used by C. Mryer (6), has the disadvantage of not
uring possible twigs of communication between nerve and nerve proximal to the
int of section. Further, for my purpose, it limited the field of reply by unnecessary
on of the motor roots. In the spinal canal the afferent roots only were divided,
x d of them, all but the one immediate under examination.
The surface of the hind limb and adjacent part of the trunk was then explored, and
Be points from which reflex movements could and could not be initiated were ascer-
ned. It was assumed that each spot of surface, from which no reflex movement
puld be elicited, had lost its nervous connection with the spinal cord, and, therefore,
id not receive supply from the roots remaining unsevered. The mode of excitation
