appears not always to have been correctly answered. A study of some of the
published cases will bring this out. When the nerve is exposed for the anastomosis
it ought invariably to be stimulated by a weak galvanic current, and should
contraction be found in any of the facial muscles, then the central end of the nerve
cannot be regarded as quite useless, and it may be very useful. Thus, at six months
after the onset of the facial paralysis, there may have been no evident recovery in
the face, but the nerve might well be found to be conducting impulses, and in that
event this must be due to a reunion with its own central end. Again, there is
a phenomenon described by the BaLLances and Purves Stewart (29) which is of
great interest, as showing the state of the facial nerve at the time of exposure for
operation. They say: “ Another point of interest is that if the paralysed muscles
have already developed contracture, to however slight a degree, they at once become
flaccid again ; in fact, in several cases where clinically the muscles before operation
appeared to be flaccid, this flaccidity seemed to become actually exaggerated, a
condition for which we do not offer any explanation, except that possibly in such
cases the nerves, though completely disconnected from the brain, do in some way, by
virtue of the regeneration that has taken place in them, exert an influence on the
muscles” ; and again, “ the facial muscles during operation (see Cases V and VI), in
which the patient was completely anzesthetised, though unresponsive to the strongest
faradic shocks applied through the skin, nevertheless reacted when the peripheral
end of the divided facial nerve was stimulated directly. This is possibly a clinical
evidence of peripheral regeneration.” The explanation of these phenomena which
