245. Enumeration time. The enumeration time covers the work of identifying the plots
constituting the grid, examining the grids and making necessary field entries. Relevant
material is given in table 14. Under each year the first column shows the density of grids,
the second column the total number of grids, and the third column the time required for
enumeration work in hours per grid. In 1939 this time decreased appreciably with increasing
density of grids. This was due to the fact that one portion which we have called the time for
‘small journey’, namely, the time required for moving from one grid to another, had been
included under enumeration time. Naturally this time decreased with increasing density
of grids which led to the enumeration time in hours per grid to fall appreciably with increasing

densities in 1939. In 1940 the whole of the time required for ‘small journey’ was, however,
separated from enumeration time and was included in journey time; and the enumeration
