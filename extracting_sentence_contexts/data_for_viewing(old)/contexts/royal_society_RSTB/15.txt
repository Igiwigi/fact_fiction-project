plain figures for the centres of the posterior half, and figures dashed thus, 1â€™, for the
anterior half; both, of course, being on the same horizontal level.

On reference to Table 3 it will be seen that, with the exception of the fingers and
thumb, the absolute number of times that any movement is produced is much less in
the ascending parietal than the ascending frontal convolutions, and further that the
representation of even the thumb and index decreases as the gyrus is explored from
below upwards.

From our experiments it appears to us that the ascending parietal convolution has
less claim than the ascending frontal to be considered as an area of extensive represen-
tation of movement. We have been so impressed with the importance of deciding this
fact that we have usually explored the former gyrus with the current directly after the
skull has been removed, and subsequently repeated our examination of it at various
intervals during the experiment, so as to eliminate any error in the direction of loss of
excitability of the cortex of this gyrus.

We would call attention to the extraordinary degree of symmetry which exists in
all the Monkeys on which we have experimented, and also that this is not merely
morphological, but also physiological. Although this is a matter of great interest, we
cannot euter into it in further detail.

Before giving the detailed results of our work, we would lay down the following
axioms founded on our experiments.
