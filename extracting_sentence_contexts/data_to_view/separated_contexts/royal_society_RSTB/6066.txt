The only pyramidal tracts that the Monotremes possess are similar in course and
termination to the direct pyramids of other mammals. In Man and the higher
Primates these direct tracts extend-to the mid-thoracic region, but it is doubtful if
they reach below the upper cervical segments of the cord in the Monotremes. The
fact that Martin (1898) obtained movements of the forelimbs by cortical stimulation
in Ornithorhynchus does not disprove the pyramidal nature of this tract, for HuBER
showed that the facialis musculature in both Monotremes is inserted into the bones
of the forelimbs. In most higher mammals the majority of the pyramidal fibres cross at the caudal
border of the medulla oblongata and pass either to the posterior funiculi (as in most
marsupials, some rodents, insectivores, and ungulates) or to the lateral funiculi (as
in some marsupials and most of the higher mammals including Man). Kappers
has shown in many papers, and the evidence is admirably summarized in his classical
treatise (1920), that the passage of pyramidal fibres to the posterior and lateral
funiculi is probably due to the neurobiotactic influence of the sensory centres which
lie there.
