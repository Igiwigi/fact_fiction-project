Considering emotions as continuous traits, each state can be described and mapped
in a multidimensional space, portraying different psychophysiological and neurobiological
underpinnings [30,38,39]. According to the circumplex model of affect (CMA) [40], emotions
can be mapped in two dimensions through a combination of arousal and valence levels [30].
Valence refers to the pleasantness or unpleasantness of an emotion, whereas arousal refers to the


intensity of the emotional stimuli, expressed in terms of degree of activation from low to high. 3 |
Importantly, CMA assumes that these dimensions are orthogonal, thus with no mutual influence
(or interaction) among them. â€œ3

At a peripheral level, the study of emotional responses is especially related to the analysis 1B
of heart rate variability (HRV) [30-32,41,42]. This is justified by the fact that oscillations of :<
HRV above 0.15 Hz (i.e. the high-frequency band) are exclusively mediated by vagal activity :
[41,42], and oscillations below 0.15 Hz (i.e. low-frequency band) are mediated by both vagal
and sympathetic activities [43]. At a central level, emotions have mainly been studied through
functional magnetic resonance imaging, and continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) and
evoked related potentials recordings [31,44,45].

Previous studies investigated the coupled brain-heart dynamics during healthy and
pathological emotional responses (see reviews in [46,47]), highlighting connections in the vagally
mediated regulation of physiological, affective and cognitive processes. As a general approach, =
previous studies have tried to link the EEG power in specific bands to HRV measures. Although :
significant correlations were found for the a (8-12 Hz) [48-52], 6 (13-30 Hz) [49,50,53] and y 12
(>30 Hz) bands [53,54], the psychophysiological meaning of such associations is still ill-defined. nee)
