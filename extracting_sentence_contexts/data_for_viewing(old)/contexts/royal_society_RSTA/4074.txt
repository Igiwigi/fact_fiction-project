also noted the directional movement of fog water on the conical spines of cacti. In fact,
biomimetic-inspired microstructured surfaces have been found to enhance surface transportation
of water [11]. Unlike such studies that have focused on fog water harvesting on cactus spines, the
spines of cacti have also been found to be an important feature in increasing the amount of dew
harvested by certain cactus species [7]. Thus, the spines were the main points of interest in this
study with the aim of informing a future airborne harvesting device. It has been pointed out by Ju
et al. [9] that, at this point in time, it is unclear how cacti use fog harvesting by their spines. With
this in mind, this studyâ€™s focus has been to better understand how cacti use airborne moisture.

The challenge of this particular research study has been to assess how and if dew droplets
move along cacti spines and whether there is any evidence to suggest that the dew from these
spines is transported internally to the plant through the areoles. Assessment of these water
movement mechanisms has stemmed from the fact that this study has broad interest across
many disciplines and, as a consequence, has been uniquely positioned with regard to access to
measurement equipment. This has included the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
other techniques to determine the transport of water on the surface of the cacti and within its stem
with the focus being on whether cacti use dew droplets as a source of water, other than ground
water transported by their root system. To achieve this, an initial assessment was conducted to
determine whether the dew droplets on the spines move and if so, in which direction. The stem of
the plants was also examined to evaluate for vascular tissue, thus further assessing the transport
of water.
