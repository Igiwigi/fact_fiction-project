Starfish form only a very small proportion of the fossils collected in this way, and the
material available for study is the result of collection over many years. The part played by
the individuals who were interested in collecting for its own sake cannot be overestimated.

All the fossils are preserved as moulds. It is usual to find only portions of the body of the
starfish within the nodule, but these portions are very perfect. Casts from the mould show
fine details, spines, joints and facets for the accompanying musculature, grooves for vessels,
in fact all the information which can be obtained from a well-preserved endoskeleton.

The explanation which seems to fit the observations on the material is that the portions
preserved were within the mud of the sea-bottom at the time of death, and that chemical
interaction between the animal matter and the surrounding mud caused the enclosure of
the remains in a ‘flint’ casing. During this interaction the calcite of the skeleton was
gradually dissolved away. Possibly compounds of iron entered into this reaction. Usually
the hollow of the moulds is filled in with a ferric oxide or carbonate, sometimes so hard that
it has to be removed by a needle before a cast is made.

The proportion of the original animal preserved varies considerably according to its
build. Generally speaking, we can say that the central parts are often preserved in their
entirety, whilst the projecting parts, the arms, are often missing. It is suggested later that
