Specimen IIT. all the dimensions are smaller, while, as we shall see, the mature
specimens which had developed an integument reached a considerably greater size.
Radial sections scarcely ever show the sporangium in its full height, for the upper
ridge-like part is so narrow that it rarely happens to coincide with the plane of
section (see fig. 3, in which the sporangia appear too low).

At the distal end, where the sporophyll becomes convex on its upper surface, the
sporangium follows its curvature, and assumes what may be called the “ saddle-bags ”
form when seen in tangential section (see phots. 8 and 6; fig. 2). As the sporophyll
curves upwards towards the vertical lamina, the height of the sporangium
correspondingly diminishes, and at the distal end its cavity is quite narrow, and its
form, as seen in tangential section, three-lobed, consisting of the apical ridge and the
two lateral flaps in contact with the sloping cushions. In fact, the distal end of the
sporangium applies itself closely to the curvature of the sporophyll surface ; seen in
horizontal section it shows two lateral processes following the surface of the lamina,

and giving a Y-shape to the sporangium in this aspect (see fig. 4). These peculiarities
of form have proved of some importance as a means of identification with corre-
sponding sections from the later, seed-like stage of the organ.
