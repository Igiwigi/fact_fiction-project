SMprars and their alloys being now s0 extensively employed in arts and manufactures,
Zand for instruments of precision, we have thought that it would be interesting, in a
Sgcientific or commercial point of view, if we were to examine their conductibility care-
Sfully and completely.
E To enable us to determine with accuracy the conducting power of all the ordinary
&metals, and of seventy of their alloys and thirty of their amalgams, we had to find out a
-Znew method of determining the conducting power of metals; for the process followed by
2M. DrseRETz could only give results to be relied upon for a few of the best conductors,
Sch as silver, gold, and copper. Further, his process, which consists in having a long
-Zand thick bar of metal, 80 as to allow holes to be dr illed, in which mercury and the bulb
Sof a thermometer are inserted, would have required a large quantity of each metal in a
tate of purity, the labour of obtaining which, even comparatively pure, is well known.
SAlko from the fact of mercury being employed, we should have been unable to ascertain
= he conducting power of such important alloys as brass and bronzes, and could not
Shave applied the process to amalgams.
E The method which we have followed gives such consistent results, that we have not
only been able to determine the influence exercised on the conducting power of metals
by the addition of 1 or 2 per cent. of another metal, but also to appreciate the difference
of conductibility of two alloys made of the same metals, and only differing by a few per
Reent. in the relative proportions of the metals composing them. At the same time the
conditions theoretically required in order to obtain results independent of everything
but the nature of the substances, are not very rigorously fulfilled, 80 that the term con-
ducting power, as used by us, must be understood in a somewhat qualified sense, and as
having relation to our method of determining it. We believe, however, that the ratios
of the conducting powers, as determined by our method, do not differ from those of the
