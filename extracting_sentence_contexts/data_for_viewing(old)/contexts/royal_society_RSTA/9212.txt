giving satellite difference 2°70, but the measures are not very accurate, especially that
of D,. There is a considerable linkage in which no cycles appear. It contains, how-
ever, the line 29084, referred to under the P linkage, as connecting with lines init. It
is itself a clear D line, as the linked mesh in the map shows. In order to test the
links into the P map lines, the formule have been calculated up to the strong line
38234 (see AgP (iii.)). The modifications of many links would seem to point to dis-
placements producing about 1°5. For instance in the first eleven links there are three
examples, viz., the links below Nos. 1, 4, and 9. It is possible that they occur in the
d sequence and not in the links themselves. For this reason and because the actual
D (4) lines may be considerably in error, displacements have not been introduced into
the formule, and errors up to d\ = ‘1 or "2 have been admitted, whilst changes from
the satellite sequence d, to the chief line sequence d, have been allowed. But as a
fact there does not seem to be much demand for these displacements either in D (4)
or D(5), and the linkages are distinguished from those for the P and $8 linkages by .
their absence. In No. 2 there is an example of a link acting as a pure displacement
so that the three lines (A) D(4), D(4), (—A) D(4) exist. The link after No. 6 has

been taken as normal, although its amount is v(—d)+'21, on account of the large
errors required in 5, 6 caused by neglect of the apparent displacement 1°5 in the fourth
link. The e link between Nos. 18,19 might be the usual modified e(—28), but the
arrangement adopted to change from the satellite d, to the main d, would seem
preferable. A change from d, to d, also comes in Nos, 24,27. It is curious to note that
