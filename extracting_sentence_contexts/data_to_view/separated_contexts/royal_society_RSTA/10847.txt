EWING AND MR. W. ROSENHAIN

The low power required is a further advantage in view of the fact that an etched
lead surface must be kept wet with an acid solution while it is being examined and
photographed, as such a surface becomes dull and useless as soon as it dries. To identify the areas which were to be kept under observation, we marked them
by scratches or furrows made with a steel point. Unsymmetrical patterns of marking
were used for this purpose to facilitate replacing the specimen in its former position
and orientation.
