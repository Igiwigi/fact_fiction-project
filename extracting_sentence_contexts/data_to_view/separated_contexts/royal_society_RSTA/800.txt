It has been pointed out in a
series of papers that the applicability of KdV as a model for tsunami wave propagation should
be questioned; see the discussions in [1,2,33,34]. The main argument is that the balance between
nonlinearity and dispersion as embodied by KdV would occur at time and length scales which
cannot be realized on Earth. Our analysis in ยง4 for gkdV shows that the inclusion of Coriolis
effects in the model does not alter this fact. The discussion in ยง4 shows, however, that gBouss, which was derived in near-field variables
as opposed to the far-field variables used for gKdV, may be an appropriate model to study
tsunami wave propagation, because the relevant distances required for the near-field balance are

more realistic. Our derivation is based on the f-plane approximation, which is applicable in the : =
context of tsunami waves near the Equator.
