costs of carrying out the same computations using intracellu-
lar neurochemistry are many orders of magnitude lower.
Metabolic cost has been suggested as a unifying principle
in neuronal biophysics [54]. These metabolic cost consider-
ations have recently led two influential neuroscientists to
promulgate the principle: ‘...compute with chemistry. It is
cheaper’. [55, p. 124].

It has recently been discovered that the CS—US interval in
eyeblink conditioning is encoded by a cell-intrinsic mechanism
in the cerebellar Purkinje cell [56]. In the vast literature on the
neurobiology of memory, this is the only case in which
the engram for a specified quantitative experiential fact (the
duration of the CS—-US interval) has been localized—and it
has been localized to a sub-cellular level. In this case at least,
the numeron encoding the duration of an interval resides in a
cell-intrinsic medium, not in a plastic synapse.

These considerations—the metabolic and volumetric costs
and the fact that the CS—US interval is stored by a cell-intrin-
sic mechanism—lead me to seek answers at the cell-intrinsic
level, which is to say at the molecular level. At that level, it is
easier to find structures of the kind one would look for to
implement an efficient, versatile number-encoding scheme.
