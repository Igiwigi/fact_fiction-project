+ © Instead of the radial type of development we meet quite unmistakeably with a lateral symmetrical type ;
instead of the extended form of the body we find a short compressed body without repetition of segments or
lateral appendages.” —R. Lzvoxarr, Morphol, p. 125.

46 MR. T. H. HUXLEY ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA.

velopment of the Nudibranchiata, Tectibranchiata and Pectinibranchiata, tends to
the conelusion, that in them the visceral mass is thrust out behind the anus; is in
fact a post-abdomen*. Plate V. figs. 6-8.

A little consideration will show that the intestine drawn into this must become
bent towards the hamal side, as in fact it is in the embryos of all three groupsFÞ.

Upon embryological grounds, then, we shonld establish two great primary modifi-
cations of the molluscous archetype; the one characterized by the development of an
abdomen, and a consequent neural flexure of the intestine ; the other marked by the
development of a post-abdomen, and the consequent hemal flexure of the intestine.

But these modifications of anatomical structure exactly correspond with those
which T have already demonstrated, upon anatomical grounds, to occur in the Ptero-
poda and Heteropoda; and I trust I am not overstepping the bounds of legitimate
