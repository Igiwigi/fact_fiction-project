He found, by the use of his equation
of transfer, the change in certain functions of the molecular velocities by collisions,
e.g., U*, U*, UV’, &c., and compared the result with that obtained by a direct integration. By choosing as many functions as there were unknowns, a sufficient of equations were
obtained to evaluate them. The result obtained by MAxwetut for the stress in a gas is, making the necessary
changes in the notation,

An examination of his work, however, reveals that a numerical error has been made
in the calculation of the last term, and that a term involving a time derivative has been
omitted without any express mention of the fact. The above equation should read

involving a change in the coefficient of V’L and the addition of the last term.
