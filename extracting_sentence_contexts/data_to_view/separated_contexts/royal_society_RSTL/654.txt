Trans. for 167g,
Pp. 609g, a case is stated of a person who Iaboured under an
indisposition, attended with sickness and vomiting. In one
attack of vomiting, he brought up matter resembling tallow,
four pieces of which weighed half an ounce. This process of forming fat in the lower intestines by means
of bile, throws considerable light upon the nourishment de-
rived from clysters, a fact well ascertained, but which could
not be explained. It also accounts for the wasting of the body,
which 50 invariably attends upon all complaints of the lower
bowels. It accounts, too, for all the varieties in the turns of
the colon, which we meet with in 80 great a degree in diffe-
rent animals.
