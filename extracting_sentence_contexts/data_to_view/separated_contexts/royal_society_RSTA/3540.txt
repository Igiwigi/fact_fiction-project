You were talking about the rate at which things appear,
hydrogen before or after a crack—it is probably already there. If you’ve
got hydrogen around, it will soak through the whole structure, and as
the opportunity appears, it’ll stick to it. That prevents the metal matrix
sticking back together again, and that’s an amateurish explanation of in
fact almost all of your initial questions. Perhaps you are being far too sophisticated, especially when you get : 2
into quantum mechanics and the rest of it. I mean, a hydrogen atom is : >
a quantum if you like, but all atoms are.
