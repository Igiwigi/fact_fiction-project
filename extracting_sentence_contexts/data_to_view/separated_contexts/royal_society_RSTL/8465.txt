sheath by means of its
radiating and longitudinal fibres, which spread out and invest the large glandular cavity
at its base or prostate, and thus form an ovoid muscular bulb. The cavity in this bulb
or prostate is lined with a glandular epithelium disposed in a series of follicles
(Plate XII, fig. 2). The epithelium is of the same nature as that found lower down
in the central tube of the penis, but is here especially deyeloped: it is very conspicuous

in carmine preparations, from the fact that it remains almost unstained. The glandular
elements are transparent and devoid of nuclei; at the mouths of the follicles they are
long and tumid, and form finger-like processes, whilst in the cavities of the follicle they
are smaller and angular in outline from mutual appressure. In longitudinal sections of the bulb of the penis there are to be seen running inwards
from its periphery to its glandular cavity peculiar wavy bands, which in carmine prepara-
tions stand out, into relief unstained amongst the surrounding deeply stained muscular
tissue (Plate XII. fig.
