It would seem to be a molecular compound of the formula
Ag,X, Ag NH,X, in which the substance acts as a dibasic acid; but it is refe:
to here only to emphasize the fact that excess of alkali should be avoided in prepari
solutions for precipitation as described above. It would serve no good purpose to attempt, with the above evidence, to assign
definite formula to the yellow pigment, but the following points are, I think, wo
of consideration. As I have ventured to assert above, the fact that substan! agreement is seen in the analyses of products from insects of divers species, th
locality, habits, and food plants of which differ widely, is strong evidence that
chemical individual is being dealt with, in a condition of, at least, approxim
purity. This is certainly borne out by the general behaviour of the product
prepared for analysis, for, after purification as described above, it permits of no sort 0
fractionation that I have been able to discover.*
