to work with reliable statistics [39].

Regarding the selection of the parameters, Bandt & Pompe suggested working with 4<
D <6 and specifically considered an embedding delay t =1 in their cornerstone paper [15].
Nevertheless, it is clear that other values of t could provide additional information. It has been
shown recently that this parameter is strongly related, if it is relevant, to the intrinsic time scales
of the system under analysis [43-45].

The local sensitivity of Fisher information measure for discrete PDFs is reflected in the fact
that the specific ‘i ordering’ of the discrete values p; must be seriously taken into account in
evaluating the sum in equation (3.5) [18,19]. The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind
of ‘distance’ between two contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent
summands would lead to a different Fisher information value. In fact, if we have a discrete PDF
given by P = {p;,i=1,...,N} we will have N! possibilities for the i ordering.



The question is, which is the arrangement that one could regard as the ‘proper’ ordering?
The answer is straightforward in some cases, a histogram-based PDF constituting a conspicuous
example. For such a procedure, one first divides the interval [a,b] (with a and b the minimum
and maximum amplitude values in the time series, respectively) into a finite number of non-
overlapping sub-intervals (bins). Thus, the division procedure of the interval [a,b] provides
the natural order sequence for the evaluation of the PDF gradient involved in the Fisher
information measure. In our current paper, we chose for the BP PDF the lexicographic ordering
