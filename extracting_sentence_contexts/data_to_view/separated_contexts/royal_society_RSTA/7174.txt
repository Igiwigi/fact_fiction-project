These side reactions are often variable and difficult to control, and the small variations in
structure they cause may be expected to have quite marked effects on the crystallization
behaviour of the polymer. The purpose of the investigations described in this and subsequent papers is to ascertain
how the conditions of crystallization in polymers affect the arrangement of the polymer
chains and thence the properties, and how some of the more important polymer molecular
structural features influence the crystallization process. The problem is akin to that dealt
with in metallurgy but complicated by the fact that the units which make up the crystalline
localities in the structure are parts of long polymeric chains. This first part is concerned with an exploratory investigation of the factors which affect
the course of the crystallization in polyethylene terephthalate as measured by density
changes and a preliminary examination of the resulting crystalline structures. In part II
consideration is given to possible mechanisms whereby the randomly arranged long-chain
molecules in amorphous polymer order themselves into a semicrystalline state, and it is
demonstrated that the most probable mechanism conforms with what is known of the
spherulitic structures in polymers and leads to kinetics which fit the observed course of the
crystallization.
