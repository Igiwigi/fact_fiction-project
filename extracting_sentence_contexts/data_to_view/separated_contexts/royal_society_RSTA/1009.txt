were observed between hydrogels with anisotropy parallel with the magnetic field and isotropic
magnetic hydrogels. This effect corroborates the hypothesis that not only the spatial anisotropy is important,
but also a strong interaction is fundamental in anisotropic hydrogels to provide a noticeable
enhancement of their mechanical properties. An essential difference between the peptide-based
and the fibrin-based systems studied in the previous paragraphs, and the alginate-based system
of the current paragraph, is the fact that in the former systems, a polymerization process that
results in the effective integration of the particles within the 3D network took place. In contrast,
in the case of alginate-based system, the hydrogel was built by the electrostatic cross-linking of
the alginate molecules, mediated by the Ca”* ions, resulting in the particles embedded within the
polymer network, without the existence of an effective linkage between them and the polymer
chains. Other factors, such as the application of a magnetic field, might drive the appearance of
anisotropy, as shown in figure 7a.
