The violet ones consist of neutral
fat with a very slight admixture of fatty acid, while the purple ones are composed
largely, and the blue ones probably entirely, of fatty acid. On the following morning
about a dozen other sections from the same batch, which had been lying overnight in
weak formalin in a covered vessel, were stained in exactly the same way, but in none
of them could droplets stained red be found ; they were all blue or bluish purple. This clearly pointed to the fact that hydrolysis of the neutral fat had been taking
place during the night and that, by the morning, the droplets consisted entirely of
acid fat. Formalin is frequently acid, due to the presence of formic acid (produced
by oxidation of a portion of the formaldehyde), and on testing the sample in which
the sections had stood overnight it proved to be distinctly acid. The presence of
even this small amount of formic acid, acting overnight, had evidently caused
hydrolysis of the neutral fat, in the minute and easily accessibl√© globules in the
chlorogogen cells, converting it into the corresponding fatty acid.
