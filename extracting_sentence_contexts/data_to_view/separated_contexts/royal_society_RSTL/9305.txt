From the fact that the fibre of silk had shown positive motion 80 nearly up to the
pressure of the atmosphere it might have been anticipated that the spider line, on
account of its much greater thinness, would have shown positive motion even at
pressures considerably above that of the atmosphere. But the reasoning of Art. 46
respecting the differences of temperature to be maintained and the effect of the air
currents, obviously applies with greater force to the spider line than to the fibre of

8ilk, and at once accounts for the observed fact that the positive motion with the
spider line was not obtained until the pressures were somewhat lower than those
necessary for the fibre of silk. 52. Both with the fibre of silk and the spider line the phenomena of imnpulsion (the
excess of pressure against warm surfaces) were apparent and consistent at densities
many hundred times greater than the highest densities ab which like results are
obtained with vanes several hundred times broader than the fibre of silk ; this verifies
the theoretical conclusion on which this part of the investigation was based.
