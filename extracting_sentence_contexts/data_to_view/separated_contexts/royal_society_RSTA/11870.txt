N. LOCKYER ON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC

of a sun spot or a prominence, of determining the spectrum of a practically isolated
mass of vapours in the hottest region open to our inquiries, and seeing whether it is
like or unlike the general spectrum of the sun. What then are the facts?..... The whole character of the spectrum of iron, for instance, is changed when we pass
from the iron lines seen among the Fraunhofer lines to those seen among the spot and
prominence lines; a complex spectrum is turned into a simple one, the feeble lines
are exalted, the stronger ones suppressed almost altogether.” *

One of the best examples of the changes of intensity of the iron spectrum brought
about by changes of temperature is afforded by the group of three lines at wave-
lengths 4918, 4919°8, and 4923'2 (Anasrrém’s scale). In the solar spectrum, 4919°8
is thickest, in the oxyhydrogen flame none of them is visible, in the electric spark
with jart, 4923°2 is thickest, while it is almost invisible in the electric are; under no
conditions are all intensified at once, each one seems intensified at the expense of the
other.
