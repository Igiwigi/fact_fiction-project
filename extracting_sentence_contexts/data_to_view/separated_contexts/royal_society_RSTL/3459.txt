It may be further remarked, that the occurrence of ecchymoses entirely accords
with the idea of partial contractions, while it is inconsistent with that of an universal
one, for how could the vessels be torn in tetanic spasm if this were merely a strong and
enduring, but uniform approximation of all the elements of the primitive fasciculi to
one another? They would be compressed indeed, but not dragged asunder ; whereas,
such would be the natural effect of excessive partial contractions, oscillating from
place to place, and continually drawing in opposite directions, and in an irregular
manner, the uncontracted portions ; for the capillaries take a longitudinal course be-

tween the primitive fasciculi, and inosculate with one another by very frequent
transverse branches, which complete the vascular web, and serve to attach its several
parts to the primitive fasciculi which occupy its interstices,

Lastly, all the specimens of bloodless tetanic muscle which T have seen, have pre-
sented this striking peculiarity :—that the pallor has not occupied the whole musele,
but patches of it, comprehending a portion of many primitive fasciculi, but not the
entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion. What has now been advanced, seems to render it —as it appears to me—certain, that
the tetanic spasm has consisted in contractions engaging only parts of each primitive
fasciculus at a time, and if 80, of course changing their place, in order to bring every
portion into use in its turn. Whether the primitive fasciculi alternate with one
another in their contractions, is an obscure question, on which these obseryations
shed no light.
