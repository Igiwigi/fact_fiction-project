The schist rock, in colour, passes from fawn-colour and light greenish ashen grey
into a rather dark tea-green. It owes its colour to disseminated thin layers of chlorite,
and probably of black or green mica in minute scales, between which are thicker layers
of quartz, presenting identically the same mineral characters as those of the quartz rock
beneath. These layers, owing to the small relative hardness and cohesion of the chlo-
rite and mica, present planes of weakness and of separation ; the rock is, in fact, every-
where thinly foliated, the average thickness of a plate seldom exceeding 02 of an inch,
and averaging about one half that thickness. These foliations are twisted, bent, doubled
up, and distorted in every conceivable way. The contortions are often large, the curyes
having radii of some feet, with minor distortions within and upon them ; but most comÂ»
monly they are small; s0 that it is rare to get even a hand specimen presenting Hat and
undistorted foliations, while, quite commonly, hand specimens may be found presenting
within a cube of 4 or 5 inches two or three curves of contrary flexure, often in all three
axes, and with curvatures short, sharp, and abrupt, almost angular.
