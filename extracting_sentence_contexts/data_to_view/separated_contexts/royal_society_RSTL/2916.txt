Now the capacity of the shell and the dimensions of the
animal began together, and they increase thus in a constant ratio; the whole bulk of
the animal bears therefore a constant ratio, of greater inequality, to the whole capacity
of the shell, in aquatic shells : in land $hells, it is probably equal to it. Now let the generating curve of a shell be conceived to describe, as it revolves
round its axis, a series of snccessive equal angles, represented each by A Â©. Corre-
sponding to these equal increments of the angle of reyolution of the generating

* $0 that moved parallel to itself until it intersected the axis, it would always intersect it at the same angle.
+ The circle may, in fact, be considered a logarithmic spiral, the constant inclination of whose tangent to its
radius vector is a right angle. Of all curves, this spiral, considered as thus including the circle, is the simplest.
