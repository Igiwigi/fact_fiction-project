The efficiency index, which is, in fact, the first law efficiency, n =p/q4, is defined as the ratio
of work produced and driving heat q+. Let us consider the effect of o on n. The balance equations for energy and entropy are

q+ —q-—p=0 (G1)

and
q+ q-

To te=0 (3.2)


Vanishing right-hand sides of these equations correspond to the fact that the state of working
body either generally does not change in time (vapour and gas turbines) or changes cyclically
(vapour machines). Thermal efficiency n = p/q+ follows from equation (3.1) in the form

On the other hand, as follows from equation (3.2)

— TL TL
aa = —-+o—.
q+ T+ q+

Therefore,

TT. _1-T_/Ty

=o 3.3
T, °q, 1+0T_/p (33)

Thermal efficiency 7 is equal to Carnot efficiency when any irreversible phenomena are absent
in the system. Whenever a quantitative estimation of entropy production is possible, i.e. one
can find o9 such that o > 09 > 0, then an improved estimate for efficiency n can be obtained by
substituting o into any of the two expressions of equation (3.3).
