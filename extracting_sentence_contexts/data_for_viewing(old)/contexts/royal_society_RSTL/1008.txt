I. The Bakerian Lecture, on some chemical Agencies of Electricity.
By Humphry Davy, Esq. F.R.S. M.R.1. A.

Read November 20, 1806.

1. Introduction,

Tur chemical effects produced by electricity have been for
some time objects of philosophical attention; but the novelty
of the phenomena, their want of analogy to known facts, and
the apparent discordance of some of the results, have involved
the enquiry in much obscurity.

An attempt to elucidate the subject will not, 1 hope, bz
considered by the Society as unfitted to the design of the
Bakerian Lecture. I shall have to detail s0me minute (and I
fear tedious) experiments; but they were absolutely essential
tothe investigation. I shall likewise, however, be able to offer
some illustrations of appearances which hitherto have not
been fully explained, and to point out some new properties
of one of the most powerful and general of material agents.
