The screen has now entirely
altered the disposition of the lines of pressure. Position 3, where in the last experi-
ment the indicator was almost stationary, is now the position of greatest speed. The
indicator, in fact, has the rays which, in the absence of the screen, struck it on both
sides, now acting on one side only, and the result is a rapid rotation in the direction of
the arrows. No. 1 is the nexb best position, and then 2. The velocity and direction
of movement in these two positions are clearly due to rays of force not acting 80
strongly on the side next the screen.
