356 DR. DALTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

should never have the feeble efforts of carbonic acid and aqueous vapour diffusing
those elements against the immense pressure of the atmosphere. The principle I
contend for has, I believe, obtained general assent ; but I apprehend few have been
aware of the consequences. If we suppose a carbonic acid atmosphere of 15 inches
of mercury pressure and a hydrogen atmosphere of the same pressure, together con-
stituting a mixture of the two amounting to 30 inches of pressure, were to surround
the earth, I think no one would hazard a conjecture that these two would be found
in equal proportions at every elevation in the atmosphere; yet a similar 8upposition
seems prevalent with regard to our present atmosphere of oxygen and azote. It has
been an object of investigation with me for many years to find how the fact stands in
this respect ; that is, whether the oxygen is more abundant relatively in the lower
strata of the atmosphere than in the higher, as it ought to be in a stagnant column ;
or whether the constant agitation of the atmosphere and the predominant mechanical
power of the azotic part of it do not prevent that equilibrium which a stagnant
mixture of aerial fluids of different specific gravities would effect. From the experi-
ments about to he related, I have reason to believe that the higher regions of the
atmosphere are somewhat less abundant in the proportion of oxygen than the lower,
though the reverse might be expected from the enormous consumption of oxygen by
daily processes on the surface of the earth, when we know of no proportionate con-
sumption of azote. It appears, however, that the disproportion of the two elements
at different elevations is by no means 80 great as theory requires; and therefore we
must conclude the unceasing agitation of the atmosphere by currents and counter-
