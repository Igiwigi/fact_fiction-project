73 The difficulty here seems to me to make it evident @ priori that (150), with the
= reckoning of 0B/ét should represent the distortional activity (plus rotational
derstood) ; this interesting property should, perhaps, rather be derived from the
‘agnetic stress when obtained by a safe method. The same remark applies to the
ectric stress. Also, in (150) to (155) we overlook the Poynine flux. I am not
gure how far this is intentional on Professor Herrz’s part, but its neglect does not
fem to give a sufficiently comprehensive view of the subject.

It is the last term of (156) and the last term of (157), together, which bring in the
Poyntine flux. Thus, adding these equations,
