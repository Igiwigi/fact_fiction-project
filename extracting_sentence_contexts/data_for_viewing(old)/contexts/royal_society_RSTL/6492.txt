S of speculum-metal formed in the air-holes of damp sand-moulds, also the thin plates

Swere not then aware of the fact that alloys of tin and copper are softened by sndden

= Mr. Povres, in Sir David BrewsrTER's Â© Journal * for 1831, directs attention to the
Z apparent hardness and soundness of speculum-metal cooled instantaneously ; but he does
.2not appear to haye operated upon a larger scale than Mr. CurnBerr, his castings not
S exceeding 13 ounce. Mr. M*CULLaGn seems also to have noticed the same facts; and,
Eindeed, it is not likely they could haye been unnoticed by any one who had been engaged
Emuch in speculum-casting ; but the obvious fact that any considerable mass of an
Zalloy with such large expansions and contractious as speculum-metal, and s0 brittle,

Slarge telescopes with such a material.
DS In all our carlier experiments the castings were made in damp sand, precisely as in
S the common process of casting iron or brass. Where the founder, however, aims at the
Sbest results, especially in brass-casting, he dries the mould : he thus escapes the mischief
Whontimes arising from the evolution of hydrogen, which, unlike steam, makes its way
E through the sand with difficulty. Steam in small quantity does no mischief, because it
enters the interstices of the sand, where it is immediately condensed.

In the hopes of better results we dried the moulds; but, strange to say, the castings
were less perfect. At the low temperature at which specula are cast, the tin acts but
