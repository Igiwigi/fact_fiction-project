SHIELDS ON THE

gallate. On transferring the latter to the eudiometer and exploding with oxygen, it
was found to be composed chiefly of hydrogen, together with a small quantity of some
hydrocarbon which was not further investigated. On several occasions we have obtained specimens of platinum black of low
absorptive power, which may readily be distinguished by the fact that they have
a grey appearance instead of the usual dead black. (Platinum black of this
description is apparently formed by the reduction of solutions which are acid instead
of neutral or slightly alkaline.)

A quantity of this greyish platinum black from a preparation which on ignition
in a vacuum gave off only 21 volumes of oxygen was treated with ammonia gas.*

After exhausting at the ordinary temperature, 24°83 volumes of gas were extracted
on ignition and were found to consist of CO, 4:2 volumes, O, 0:0 volumes,
H, 15°6 volumes, and N, 5:0 volumes. The total gas extracted, viz., 24°8 volumes, is sufficiently close to 21 volumes, the
amount of oxygen originally contained in another sample of the same preparation, to
warrant the inference previously drawn with regard to sulphur dioxide, and confirmed
in the case of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methyl alcohol and formic acid, that, when
these reducing substances act on platinum black the oxygen is removed but its
place is taken by nearly the same number of volumes of the reducing substance or its
products of decomposition. In former experiments, this number always approximated
to 100 volumes, since the platinum black investigated contained nearly 100 volumes
of oxygen, Furthermore, the removal of the redacing substance or its products
from the platinum black seems to be just as difficult to accomplish as the removal of
the oxygen itself.
