from 0° C. to 35° C, must affect the whole form of the curve, and even the apparent
discrepancy of 0°4 per cent. at 100° C., shown in fig. 3, does not exceed the limits of
possible error in the calculation,

Apart from variations in the fundamental constant (depending possibly on the
quality of the ice formed), and uncertainty of the correction for creep of zero, which
might give rise to accidental errors, the main source of systematic error in Drerericr’s
method would lie in the correction for the water equivalent of the quartz-glass bulbs,
and in loss or gain of heat during transference from the heater to the calorimeter.
The water equivalent of each bulb was calculated from its mass by means of a formula
for the variation of the specific heat of quartz, which is appropriate if there is no
heat-loss in transference. It appears probable, however, that bulbs of different form
and thickness would experience different losses in transference. In fact, a small
systematic error of this kind is indicated by the observations themselves, and might
produce appreciable errors at the higher temperatures.


HEAT OF WATER, WITH EXPERIMENTS BY A NEW METHOD. 13

Below 100° CG. the uncertainty would probably not exceed 1 in 1,000, as the
thermal capacity of the bulbs employed was only a quarter of that of the contained
water. From 130° C. to 220° C. all the observations, except one at 130° C., were
made with bulbs having a thermal capacity nearly equal to that of the contained
water. In the observations at 100° C., 109° C., and 130° C., where both thick and
thin bulbs were employed, the results deduced from the thick bulbs, assuming the
