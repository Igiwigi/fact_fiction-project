described. As seen from the photographs, the crossed pyramidal tract has a some-
what round outline and is fairly compact. Compared with the monkey it is much
less extensive. In configuration in the cervical region the pyramidal tract of the
monkey differs markedly from the cat. Thus in a section of the cervical cord of
the monkey after removal of the motor cortex (ScHAreR and FRAncr’s case), a
distinct patch of degeneration may be seen on the outer side of the lateral cerebellar
tract, the latter thus dividing the pyramidal tract. SHERRINGTON has drawn attention
to this (‘ Journal of Physiology,’ 1889 and 1893), as also France, Coinciding with —
this, Morr (‘ Phil. Trans., 1892) describes the direct cerebellar tract leaving the
periphery in the upper cervical region.

It is an old observation that the so-called pyramidal area is greater after a
hemisection in the cord than after lesions of the cortex. This is due to the fact that
descending fibres other than those of the crossed pyramidal tract are cut across. At
the same time, it appears to me that the degeneration in the pyramidal tract proper
is more intense after hemisection than after removal of a hemisphere.

The Degeneration in the Cranial Nerve Roots.

Optic Nerve.—The optic tract of the right side is divided in removal of one cerebral
hemisphere. Corresponding with this there appears to be complete blindness of the
right eye, and slight curtailment of the field of vision of the lefteye. I have reserved
however for subsequent investigation the disputed point, whether in the cat there is
complete decussation or slight bifurcation. In Gourz’s dog, described by LANGLEY and
