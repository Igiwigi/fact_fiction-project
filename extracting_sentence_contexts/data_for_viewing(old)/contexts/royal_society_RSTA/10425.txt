of the crystal axes having been calculated from some of these angles, the remaining
angles are calculated on the assumption that they belong to planes whose intercepts
are certain rational sub-multiples of the axes, and they are then found to agree very
closely with the means of the observations.

Two assumptions are here made: (1) that the individual variations are just as
likely to give angles which are too large as angles which are too small, and (2) that
the faces do obey the law of simple rational indices.

Even when the calculations are made by the method of least squares, these
assumptions still underlie the process.

The small individual variations are, in fact, regarded as irregular and of secondary
importance, and are practically ignored ; if they be thus left out of account, it cannot
be denied that within narrow limits the angles of most crystals do approximate very
closely to those required by the law of simple rational indices. Occasionally, however,
the deviation is too great to be treated in this way, and the direction of the face can

Cubes of fluor, for example, will often yield no reflections corresponding to the true
