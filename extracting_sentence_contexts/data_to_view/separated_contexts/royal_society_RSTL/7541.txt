E In the Fibulg the peroneal malleolus is not produced out into a strong process as in
© other Anthropoidea, but it descends much further down than does the tibial one, by
S which character Man differs from all the rest of the Order. The fibula of Man is exca-

8. that of the same part in the Gorilla and Orang.

= Tts length, in proportion to that of the spine, is exceeded by that of all other Primates
i= except Lemur, and (as far as I have been able to ascertain) the Nycticebinz, and per-
V haps also some of the lower Simiidzz and Cebidz. Man, however, more exceeds Arc-
E tocebus in this proportion than he is exceeded by the Gorilla,

E Its length, as compared with that of the pelvic limb minus the pes, is less than in any
S other Primate, Hylobates and the Nycticebine, however, approaching him rather nearly
An this respect.

'The same is the case as regards the proportion borne by the pes to the tibia.

'The antero-posterior plantar arch is, as has been before said, extensive and peculiar
(from the fact of the hallux forming the fulerum in standing and walking), the
tuberosity of the calcis and the distal ends of the inner metatarsals resting on the ground ;
but, as has been pointed out already, even in Man the outer side of the tarsus and me-
tatarsus is applied, in standing, to the supporting surface, while in many other Pri-
mates the inner side of the tarsus and metatarsus is more raised from the ground
than in him. $0 that the distinction between Man and Apes, in this respect, is much
less than is often snpposed.
