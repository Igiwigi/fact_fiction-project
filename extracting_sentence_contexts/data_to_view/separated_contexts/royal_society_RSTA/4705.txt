First and foremost, the equivalence relations of transformation optics are valid for the full-
wave Maxwell equations. Indeed, in contrast to optical conformal mapping, transformation optics
successfully incorporates geometrical concepts to manipulate the wavelike behaviour of light,
a regime that is known to be incompatible with the geometrical concepts used in the eikonal
approximation. This can be understood from the fact that conformal transformations transform
only the Helmholtz equation with form invariance. In the case of media with inhomogeneous
permittivity and permeability, however, one needs to make a short-wavelength approximation
to put the wave equation for the electromagnetic fields in the Helmholtz form. Variations of the
refractive index profile will thus introduce unwanted distortions in the propagation expected
from the conformal map.
