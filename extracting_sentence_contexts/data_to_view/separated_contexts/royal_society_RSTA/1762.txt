The effect of existing vegetation is somewhat larger for
the PM precursors SO7 and NH3, but the conversion to woodland has a comparably smaller
effect than on PM because the deposition rate of the gases is less sensitive to the vegetation type. Interestingly, for both O3 and NOz, the current urban vegetation cover decreases concentrations
as may be expected due to the additional dry deposition, but the additional conversion of open
urban greenspace to woodland is forecast to increase concentrations in urban areas, although
slight reductions are seen away from sources (figure 3). This would imply that tree planting,
aimed at reducing NO2 emissions, may in fact increase urban NO? concentrations through
processes that are explored in §3c(iii).

(c) Assessment of interactions
(i) Wet deposition

The modelling of the pollutant capture by vegetation through the ACTM approach allows some
interesting interactions to be identified and quantified that may not be entirely obvious initially. The reduction in pollutant concentration due to the enhanced dry deposition to vegetation results
in a reduction in wet deposition, which to some extent counteracts the benefit (table 6). The
relative effect is largest for compounds that are primarily deposited via wet deposition such as
PM.
