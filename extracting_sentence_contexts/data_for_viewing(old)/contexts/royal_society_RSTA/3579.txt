asymptotic analysis predicts that a linear spatial distribution of 61, /00 is attained behind the front
that demarcates the regions where 67 = 1 and 6; =0. Numerical and asymptotic predictions of
the spatial distributions of 4/00 are included in figure 6c at selected values of Dit. Excellent
agreement between the two sets of predictions is seen. The corresponding numerical prediction
of J versus Dut in figure 6a confirms that there is a sharp increase in J at X=1 when the front
of trapped hydrogen reaches x = 1. This is in contrast with regime I where the Fickian diffusion
nature of the governing equations implies J rises more gradually.

Regime IIIb. With 6? = 10-?, we anticipate the response to be within regime IIIb. Comparisons
between the numerical and asymptotic predictions of the spatial distributions of 61, /00 at selected
values of Dif are included in figure 6d. Reasonable agreement is observed for Dit < 1, although
the asymptotic analysis overpredicts the concentrations near the front that demarcates the regions
where 67 = 1 and 67 = 0. Again, consistent with the fact that the hydrogen is present only behind
this front, the J versus Dif curve in figure 6a shows a sharp increase when this front reaches x = 1,
ie. at DLf ~ 1/6. We note in passing that numerical predictions for regime Ila are not included as
