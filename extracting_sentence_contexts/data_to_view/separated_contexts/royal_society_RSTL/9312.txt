Coming next to the equations connecting the pairs of theta-funetions, for
instance

C0159 %9=0%gtra9g4; Feicg% 3 =0,
eqe;0gGgf Dd Vad—w bey/ ae; +0yehy. VO a=0,
the products 1/bd ad and y/be Vae contain besides a common term the terms
w(dfe,e,+d,fce) vaa,bb,, and Alefed,+eff, cd) aa,bb,, hence their difterence contains

this is

Y TOS Op
#(de,—de)(fe, —fe) Vaa,bb, which is =de.,fex/aa,bb,, that is de.fewawb : hence the
equation to be verified is R

de fe.ee;ogtra+cchohy=0 ;
Carz% G12 8 = Vbef.acd Vaefbed x/bdf.ace 4/adf bee, where under the fourth roob we

ave 24 factors, which are, in fact, 12 factors twice repeated ; and if we write

1,=ab.ac.ad.ae.af.bc.bd.be.bf.cd.ce.cf.de.df.ef, for the product of all the 15 factors,
then the 12 factors are in fact all those of II, except ab, cf, de ; viz., we have

eee = VIF+ (ab) (ef )*(de}*. Again, c,cgk;ky,=vacf.bde Vbef.ade /acdef beds, is a fourth root of a product of
32 factors, which are in fact 16 factors twice repeated, and in the 16 factors, ab does
not occur, cf and de occur each twice, and the other 12 factors each once : we thus
have

excakrky=v/ Wo Y(de)* + (ab)?,
and the relation to be verified assumes the form
fedeV/1+(f (def + v (cf F(deP=0,

which, taking fe.de=—v/ (cf )*(de)?, is right. And 80 for the other equations.
