At the moment when the ovum is expelled from the body, the envelope is merely a
thin gelatinous layer, its entire diameter being equal only to about one-sixth of the
diameter of the yelk. After it has been one minute in water, and begun to imbibe
and expand, it is then equal to about one-fourth of the diameter of the yelk. At the
end of two minutes it is enlarged to one-third, and in three minutes to one-half the
diameter of this body. In four minutes it exceeds three-fifths, and in s/w minutes
two-thirds, and it continues to imbibe fluid and expand at the same rate, until, at from
ten to fifteen minutes, it very nearly equals in thickness the whole diameter of the
yelk; and at half an hour (fig. 9) it is one-fourth greater than this. Prevosrand
Dumas* noticed the expansion of the envelope during the first s:z hours, but entirely
overlooked the rate of expansion during the most important period, the first hour,
and noticed only the general fact that the diameter of the envelope, at the end of the
first hour and a half, was as 5 to 2:5 at the time of spawning, and that it had nearly
acquired its full size at the end of three hours. My own observations agree with this
latter statement. The expansion of the envelope is greatly retarded at the end of
the third or fourth hour, until after cleavage of the yelk has taken place, when it
again proceeds, but much more slowly than at first. If then we bear in mind the
rate of expansion of the envelope during the first half-hour, the following experiments
will give some idea of the degree of susceptibility of the ovum to become impreg-
nated during that period.
