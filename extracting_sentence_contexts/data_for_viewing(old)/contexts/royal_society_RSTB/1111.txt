ount of vapour which is present in the air of the room. It did not occur to us that
this could act injuriously upon the preparations under investigation until we noticed
dm three prolonged experiments in which, owing to the method of inhalation, a large
antity of ether was used in a warm close room, that both the exposed cortex and

e sciatic nerve suddenly lost their excitability, which they did not regain. The

ssibility of this being due to that injurious action of the ether vapour dissolving in
‘he liquids upon these structures, which was pointed out by Brepsrmann, then
occurred to us. The effect of the vapour in the room was increased, perhaps, by its
dissolving in a warm bath containing 0°6 per cent. saline, which mixed with the blood
of the animal was employed for irrigation, &c., of the nerve structures. Although
the failure might have been due to other causes (exposure, &c.), still the fact of its
not occurring when special precautions were taken to avoid the excessive evaporation
of ether into the room and the contamination of the saline, leads us to conclude that
the cause mentioned is at any rate a depressing factor which ought, as far as possible,
to be excluded.

The use of chloral or morphia would undoubtedly entirely exclude any error of this
