No intermediate condition between the typical rachitomous and stereospondylous
vertebral columns is definitely known, but Gondwanosaurus may perhaps be an example. The Mastodonsaurus vertebral column in Stuttgart suggests the presence of small
pleurocentra, but without further study and preparation of this material I should not
like to be certain of their presence. That the main elements of the column of this animal are intercentra, as is now
generally recognised, is shown by the fact that they are often horseshoe-shaped, the
notochord notching the upper edge, and by the fact that the hemapophyses arise
from them in the caudal region. Shoulder Girdle. Prof. Wrutston, in his description of the osteology of Trimerorachis, has pointed
out that that animal is secondarily aquatic and that its expanded clavicles are related
to the mode of life ; with this conclusion I am in perfect agreement.
