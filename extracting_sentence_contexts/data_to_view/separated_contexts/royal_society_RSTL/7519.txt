And I assume that the theorem extends to the case
| of two inseparable conditions 2X, but in this case I do not even know where the proof
is to be sought for. The characteristics (p/, /, g') of the three conditions 3X are in general independent.
36. It has been mentioned that if (, 3) are the representatives of the condition X,
and (j, ») the characteristics of the conditions 4Z, then

(X, 42) =#p+þÞ»;
© this is the most convenient form of the theorem, but as («, B) are known functions of
© the characteristics (", »", g", o", 7") of the condition X, the equation is in effect an ex-
Z pression for (X, 42) in terms of the characteristics of X and 4, respectively.
= There is, similarly, an expression for (2X, 3Z) in terms of the characteristics
S (w,”,g, 0) of 37 (satisfying the relation p'—$/+3g—0o'=0) and the characteristics
2 (w, 2, g) of 2X, viz. we have
i (2X, 32)= ul = Ee+20)
j + W— 4 )
=] This may be easily proved in the case where the conditions 2X are two separable condi-
Z tions X, X' having the representatives («, ), (ﬆ', Þ') respectively, and the conditions 3Z
5 three separable conditions Z', Z", 7" having the representatives («",B"), (")(B"), («", Þ")
F respectively ; we have, in fact,
b= waits 2, 4Xe, B)(e, B'), 4=(L, I 4, 4Xe", Bs", BY", [oxd

E J'=(4, 2, 1X 3” rn J);

"= and with these values the function

(X, X', Z", 7", FH; =(1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1X, B)(e. BY, BY", Be", B")

is found to be expressible as above in terms of (wv, 8), (w,Y,g,0); but I do not know
how to conduct the proof for the inseparable conditions 2X and 3Z.

37. It may be remarked by way of verification that writing 8uccessively

that is,


WHICH SATISFY GIVEN CONDITIONS. 89

we have in the first case
(2X -.)= —Ig +30
—2+Þ+Ig'—20
+2p'— Y
=6+I(#—Þ +37 —),=p!,
and similarly in the other three cases,
(2X -//)=, (2K -//)=g, (2X ///)=0'.
