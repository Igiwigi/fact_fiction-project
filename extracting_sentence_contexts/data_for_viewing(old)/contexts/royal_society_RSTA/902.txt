they show that the CMS model-checking problem can be solved in time

O(F (idl, ewd(G)) - |GI), (5.10)

as there are only finitely many sentences of size bounded by a given integer. The theorem then
follows since the rank-width is bounded if and only if the clique-with is bounded, which is
because

rwd(G) < cwd(G) < 2°74)+1 _ 4, (5.11)

as shown by Oum & Seymour in [29]. a

In many cases, it is in fact the quantifier rank, see definition 5.3, which dominates the runtime
to solve MS problems. For example in [30], it is shown by Langer et al. that the MS model-checking
problem, i.e. if G — ¢, can be solved in time O(f(qr(¢), cwd(G)) - |G|°)). As discussed with Langer,
it is probably possible to extend this statement to also the CMS model-checking problem and
therefore CMS property-checking problem. We therefore make the following conjecture.

Conjecture 5.2. There exists an algorithm which checks whether an assignment a satisfies a
CoMS formula $(4) on G, i.e. whether G — $(a(%)) or not, and has a running time

O(Flqr(), rwd(G)) - IG), (5.12)

where qr(¢) is the quantifier rank of ¢, rwd(G) is the rank-width of G and f is a computable
function.
