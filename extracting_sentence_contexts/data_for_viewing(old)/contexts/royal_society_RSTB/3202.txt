or radially, and there are no glands.

Within this and forming the inner surface of the wall and about a quarter of the
whole thickness is a tissue which I take to be wholly trophoblastic (7.). On the outer
side, bounding the stroma layer just described, there is a thick columnar epithelium.

The histological detail of the specimen is far from being perfect, and so I cannot speak
with certainty as to its relation ; but, I think, it shows protoplasmic continuity with the
stroma cells similar to that described above for the plasmoditrophoblast of the sheep.

It is, moreover, always lined on its inner foetal surface by a layer of cells separating
it from the blood sinuses. The position of the nuclei is towards the foetal surface.
This fact, together with the absence of anything like a basement membrane on the
maternal side leads me to conclude that it is the advance edge of the trophoblast and
not the uterine epithelium. The staining reaction also suggests the same interpretation.

Within this comes a mass of trophoblastic cells honeycombed with spaces (Z.) filled
with maternal blood, which increase in size nearer the inner edge, and here may be
seen to open into much wider sinuses, the innermost walls of which are quite thin.
There is no sign of a somatopleur layer of mesoblast. (I did not cut the embryo.)

These blood spaces are at many points in obvious communication with the large
blood vessels in the stroma of the uterine wall. These vessels in the stroma are wide
intercellular spaces more than vessels, and simply open upon the surface up against
which the trophoblast is firmly pressed (if not in continuity).
