We should not have trusted to it, how-

ever, without referring some of the principal spectra to a comparison with the solar
gpectrum. The wave-lengths of the FRAUNHOFER lines in the infra-red region were
taken from the map furnished by one of us with the paper already referred to. A
test of the accuracy of the measurements was the fact that the same wave-lengths
of the absorption of any particular substance could always be obtained on several

photographs. we
We invariably compared all absortion spectra with that of ethy] iodide, which

furnishes almost entirely a line spectrum and, in fact, our meagurements were referred
to an empiric scale derived from the absorptions of this body, before we were
fortunate enough to obtain a wave-length scale from strict comparison with the golar
spectrum. We believe that the chloroform spectrum might be almost better to give
a fiducial scale. The multiplicity of fine lines in both of these 8ubstances makes the
mapping the spectra comparatively easy when once the position of those lines has
been accurately fixed.
