times called the protoplasm), is seen as stained by carmine imbibition. The egg is now
a little over x45 of an inch in diameter. Tt is surrounded by branched connective-
tissue corpuscles, some three or four of which are closely applicd to it. By simple plasmic
nutrition (that is, by assimilation of matters which reach it by osmotic action from the
blood) the egg-corpuscle now increases in size, especially that part of it which we
called the body, and which now begins to assume the. characteristics of an egg-yelk,
viz. in the fact that it is taking on a special and excessive growth. With this increase
of 8ize, it is to be observed that the egg has acquired a more definite envelope (fig. 15, oc.).
The egg continues to increase in bulk, and the © body ” relatively more 80 than does
the nucleus, the nucleolus of which has now become broken down. The capsule
becomes now definitely pinched off from the surrounding tissue, and a peduncle forms
to it which henceforward increases in length with the growth of the egg itself.
Whilst the peduncle is forming, the connectiye-tissue corpuscles forming the capsule
have proliferated in such a way as to form a double layer surrounding the egg, which
henceforth we can distinguish as © inner ” and © outer ” capsular membranes (Plate 11.
fig. 16). The corpuscles of the outer capsular tissue do not become materially changed;
they increase in number, and form a firm connective-tissne tunic to the egg continuous
with the peduncle. But the corpuscles of the inner capsular membrane, lying in direct
contact with the naked surface of the growing egg-cell, take on a very different cha-
