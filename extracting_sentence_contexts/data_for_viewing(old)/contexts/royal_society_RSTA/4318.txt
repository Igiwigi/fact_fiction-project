where ¢; = arctan(d;./bx).

From the above derivation, f(t) can be seen as a signal composed by K IMFs with instantaneous
frequency k6’(t), respectively. Note that the instantaneous frequencies, k0’(t), are well separated
without intersections, which means that the signal f satisfies the scale separation property. Then,
we could use the method developed in [8] to compute its phase function. We refer to [8] for the
details of the algorithm.

From the representation (2.8), we can also see another advantage of the model with shape
function. All the artificial harmonic waves are absorbed to the shape function. This enables us to
obtain a sparse representation of the signal.

Once the phase function is obtained, by exploring the fact that s is a periodic function of 6, we
can identify certain low-rank structure of the signal. This structure enables us to extract the shape
function from the signal. The details will be given in the next section.

3. An efficient algorithm to compute the shape function

The phase function @ has been obtained in the previous section, then the optimization problem
(2.6) can be reduced to the following problem:

min IFC) — a(t)s(0(t))|I3, subject to:a¢V(0), s(-) is 2-periodic.

Using the Fourier series representation of the shape function (2.7), the optimization problem
becomes
