However, while
metazoan HGT clearly occurs, the complexity of eukaryotic gen-
omes, and the ease by which samples can become contaminated
with bacterial DNA creating false positives, have thrown some
of the more extreme claims into doubt [13]. The consensus,
therefore, is that successful HGT into metazoan taxa is relatively
rare, albeit with potentially huge impact for phenotype and
fitness where it does occur [14]. By contrast, in the microbial world, HGT is a fact of life. For bacteria in particular, HGT is a major mode of adapta-
tion, making a significant contribution to genome evolution
and structure [1,15,16]. Bacterial HGT has a central role in
adaptation to environmental challenges, like colonization of
new environments, exploitation of novel carbon sources and
resistance to toxins [17].
