Rinc anp TANGENTIAL Prrrine. The presence or absence of annual rings in the Araucarinez has been a matter of
much dispute. This has resulted from individual variation and possibly also from
the fact that in some forms the rings are clearly marked, while in others there is
a ringed appearance to the naked eye, which on examination with the microscope in
transverse section is not evident. It was this which led ScHacur (1862) to state
that there are no (his own italics) annual rings in Araucaria brasiliensis, but only
an appearance of concentric circles. He says, further, that the circles are incomplete
and that in the radial direction also the rings “are lost gradually either on both sides
or on one side, and frequently, indeed, this is the outer side, whereas in true annual
rings, at least in the stem, the transition from spring to summer wood is the more
gradual.”
