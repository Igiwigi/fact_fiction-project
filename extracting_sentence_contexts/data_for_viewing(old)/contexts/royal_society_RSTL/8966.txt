1. We have four systems of a dirigent conic and circle of inversion, each giving
rise to the same bicircular quartic: viz. the bicircular quartic is the envelope of a gene-
rating circle, having its centre on a dirigent conic, and cutting at right angles the
corresponding circle of inversion; or, what is the same thing, it is the locus of the
extremities of a chord of the generating circle, which chord passes through the centre
of the circle of inversion, and cuts at right angles the tangent (at the centre of the
generating circle) to the dirigent conic; the two extremities of the chord are thus
inverse points in regard to the circle of inversion. The four systems are represented by
letters without suffixes, or with the suffixes 1, 2, 3 respectively, and we say that the
system, or mode of generation, is (, 1, 2, or 3 accordingly.

2. The dirigent conics are confocal, and their squared semiaxes may therefore be
represented by f+0, g+0, f+0, 9 +0: f+0, 9+0s f+0% 9+0, (which are in fact
functions of the five quantities f+0, f—g, 0,—0, 9,—9, 6,0); and we can in terms of
these data express the equations as well of the dirigent conics as of the circles of
inversion ; viz. taking X, Y as current coordinates, the equations are
