salt, even in the proportion of two to one, did not diminish the
effect, determined the best and svrest proportions to be, three
parts of the muriate of lime to two of snow. But, since we shall find hereafter the temperature of + g2?
to be a more convenient term of 'comparison, we may fairly state
the fact thus; that muriate of lime three parts and snow two
parts, mixed at the temperature of + g2*, will give —zo2. The snow, to produce 'the-greatest effect, he says, should be
fresh-fallen, dry,” and light or uncompressed ; and the salt per-
fectly dry, and reduced to very fine: powder. Pr. Low1Tz's method'is, to add at once the salt to the now;
the latter being previously put into a convenient vessel.
