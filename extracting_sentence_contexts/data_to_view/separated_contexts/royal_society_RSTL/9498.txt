In the Wealden Goniopholis the quadrangular dorsal seutes are united, tile-wise,
by peg-and-sockeb joints ; the equally thick ventral scutes join each other by thick
i sntural borders, and an annular arrangement of the armour needs but little to be

complete, *

; This, in fact, is effected in a more closely mailed Saurian described under the name
j of AMtosaurus ferratus.t Nearly a score of these extinct Reptiles, in all their panoply,
were discovered and exposed on one slab of * Middle Keuper sandstone,” at Haslach,
in Wirtemberg. The arrangement of the scutes is annular. The long axis of the
dorsal ones is transverse and a single pair spans the back and corresponding surface
of the tail : the ventral scutes are quadrangular, in four transverse pairs : there is

Q a single large lateral seute on each side.
