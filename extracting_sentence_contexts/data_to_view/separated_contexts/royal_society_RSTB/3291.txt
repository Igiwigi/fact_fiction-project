Where the two seams are perfectly joined, the roof is of
course common to both, and is that of the Bullion Seam, having Goniatite nodules in
its shales. Coal Balls in the Gannister Seam.—The interest for us in the junction lies in the
fact that throughout both Bullion and Gannister (after the Union) true coal balls are
found in the coal, and furthermore, coal balls are found in the Gannister itself before
the junction, when the beds approach each other closely. This is a fact which has important bearings on another subject, and will be referred
to again (p. 195), but for the moment we are concerned with the point that the coal
balls are found in the horizon below the Bullion Mine. AIrKEN, Boiron, and others have mentioned the junction of these seams, which
stretches over a considerable tract of country, but may be seen best at the Old
Meadows Pit at Bacup, where the workings expose the seams particularly well. Owing to the kindness of Mr. Inniseworrn Law we were able to make detailed
observations in this pit, on which the following account of the beds is based :—

The two seams (i.e., the “ Bullion” and “ Gannister ”) enter the hill separated by
a dozen feet of rock ; along the roads of the mine they are seen to approach each
other gradually until they meet.
