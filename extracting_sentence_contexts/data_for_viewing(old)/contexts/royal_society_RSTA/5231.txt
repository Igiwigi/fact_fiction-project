in emissions abatement?

The previous two sections argue that while reducing mitigation does not necessarily lead to a
worse outcome, it is theoretically possible for mitigation obstruction to make things worse than it
would be under the ‘baseline portfolio’. Since the baseline portfolio, consisting only of mitigation
and adaptation, would remain available to society even if it pursues climate engineering research,
choosing an inferior portfolio involving climate engineering would be irrational. Critics of the
argument from mitigation obstruction might doubt that society would choose inferior portfolios.
Thus, some might argue, simply showing that portfolios involving climate engineering could
be worse than the baseline portfolio does not show that mitigation obstruction is a serious
risk, since the fact that they would be worse suggests that policy-makers would not choose
them. The climate engineering literature, however, identifies several mechanisms that cause
society to behave irrationally—that is, to choose a suboptimal policy portfolio. We can divide
the mechanisms into three kinds: informational failures, cognitive failures and ethical failures.


Economic models of risk-taking typically assume that decision-makers have full information
about the risks they run, meaning that they know the probability of each outcome and the
magnitude of gain or loss in each outcome. This assumption does not hold in the case of climate
engineering. For various reasons, policy-makers may remain ignorant or even develop false
beliefs about the promise, efficacy and risk of climate engineering technologies. For instance, they
may come to see SRM as a ‘silver bullet’ that can ‘solve’ the problem of climate change cheaply
and easily, which could lead them to rely too heavily on SRM and invest too little in mitigation;
