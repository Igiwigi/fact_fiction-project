region. In particular, exceptionally low rates are inferred
along the branches separating Chiroptera, Perissodactyla
and Cetartiodactyla, as well as in the branches separating
Hystricomorpha, Sciuromorpha and Castoriomorpha. In
these two cases, ILS has been suspected [40]. However, ILS at
best accounts for only a fraction of the deviations detected
here, most of which are not located in regions particularly
suspected to be affected by strong ILS. Mixed clock appro-
aches could be used in the context of explicit gene-species
reconciliation models [41-43].

In principle, some of the deviations observed here could
be artefacts caused by incorrect fossil calibrations. The fact
that the same branches tend to be affected in the two contexts,
node- and tip-dating, suggests that most of the deviations
detected in the present analysis are not the result of such
mis-specifications of fossil constraints. Still, some of the
deviations observed here are clearly dependent on specific cali-
brations. In particular, a very high rate is detected under the
node-dating approach along the branch leading to Lorisi-
formes (Ofolemur and Nycticebus; electronic supplementary
material, figure S6). Lorisiformes are constrained by a lower
calibration at 37 Myr (based on the Saharagalago fossil), and
the crown age of this group is inferred to be very close to this
lower bound (between 37 and 42 Myr). In the tip-dating analy-
