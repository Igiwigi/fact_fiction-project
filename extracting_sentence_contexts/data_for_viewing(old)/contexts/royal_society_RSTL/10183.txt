The ciliated groove is distinguished by the following peculiarities : the epithelium
is thicker than it is over the rest of the stomodzeum, being at least 005 millim. thick,
the free edges of the columnar epithelium cells of which it is composed are very clear
and definite, and the cilia are remarkably long and strong, being from *006 millim. to
*007 millim Jong.

Of the genus Alcyonium I have examined three other species, namely, A. digitatum,
A. pulmonaria, and A. puchyclados, but owing to the larger number of spicules in these
species, they are not 80 favourable for histological manipulation.

An examination of living specimens of our English Alcyonium digitatum revealed
the fact that the cilia of the groove, moving almost simultaneously, produce a current
of water from without inwards, whereas the cilia lining the rest of the stomodeum
produce currents in the opposite direction. Thus a complete circulation is brought
about in the polyps; the inward current produced by the cilia of the groove is
probably aided by the cilia of the ventral mesenterial filaments, whilst an outward
current, commencing on the dorsal and lateral mesenteries, is taken up by the action
of the cilia lining the general surface of the stomodeum.

It is evident from anatomical and physical considerations that the chief part of the
propulsion of these currents is performed by the cilia lining the groove on the ventral
8ide of the stomodzum, and consequently I propose to call this groove © the sipho-
noglyphe.”
