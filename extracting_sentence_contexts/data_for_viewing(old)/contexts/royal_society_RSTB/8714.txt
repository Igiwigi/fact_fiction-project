contradiction between the proposed centrality of action in gen-
erating the bodily self by means of ES and the fact that ES also
applies to emotions and sensations. Centrality does not actu-
ally mean sufficiency. I would rather propose that action is
necessary but not sufficient to generate a full-blown bodily
self. As argued in the Introduction and as testified by empirical
evidence, the motor aspects of the bodily self enable the inte-
gration of self-related multimodal sensory information about
the body and about the world the body interacts with. It is
also worth noting that emotions are motorically expressed
and, when observed, they may generate motor resonance in
the beholder, both at the levels of the face and body. Further-
more, the fact that somatosensory areas, such as SI and SII,
show evidence of ES during the first-person experience of
touch and its observation in others [44-48] shows how actions
and their sensory consequences are multimodally integrated
within a variety of brain areas whose unimodal specialization
and vocation is clearly challenged, if not totally disproved (for
a lengthier discussion of this point, see [98]).

Let us finally see how to reconcile the relationship between
ES and the vicarious experience of others as bodily selves it
supposedly generates and the necessity to keep self and
other distinct. The possibility of entertaining a pre-reflective,
experiential understanding of others by reusing our own
