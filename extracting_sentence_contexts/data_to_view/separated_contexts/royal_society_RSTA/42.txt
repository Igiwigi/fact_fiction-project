z Since, in these winds, the air-particles are not urged from west to east by any
Zonsiderable difference of pressure at the ground- -level, whilst they are retarded by
Bicton, and sometimes even by an increasing pressure, as they go eastwards, their
‘welocity must be gradually diminished as they approach the Bay of Bengal. This fact
9s familiarly known to residents on the plains of the Ganges. The “hot winds,” which
‘Sire excessively dry as well as hot—and which, therefore, serve very effectually to
Stefrigerate the interiors of dwelling-houses by blowing through wet tatties, or screens
et fragrant grass, placed in the door and window openings on the windward side—
eldom extend as far eastwards as Monghyr, in Behar,* and their extinction takes
| Gplace very gradually. It is a matter of extreme difficulty to obtain truly comparable
“wbservations of wind velocity, owing in part to slight differences in the anemometers,
uw chiefly to the impossibility of ensuring uniform conditions of exposure; but the
following sets of stations, where the surroundings are as nearly alike as possible, show
_ a gradually diminishing velocity as we go eastwards during the hot weather,
while, at other seasons there is, in some cases, a tendency for the velocity to increase
| as we approach the sea.
