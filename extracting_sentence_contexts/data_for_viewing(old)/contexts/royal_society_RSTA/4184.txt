QBists not only interpret probability subjectively, but they also emphasize the role of ‘personal
experience’ and interpret QM as ‘a single user theory’. Experts in cognition, DM, psychology
and psychophysics could not even expect that such a cognition friendly interpretation might
be elaborated in quantum physics. (Of course, one has to take into account the contribution
of the aforementioned quantum information revolution that changed the face of Qo.)* In this
paper, we would like to highlight the role of QBism in quantum-like modelling of cognition
and DM in a rather general sense, ie. not only regarding possible DM results, but about all
DM-activity of humans. The QBist DM-scheme is based on generalization of classical FTP based
on PU of information given by an information complete measurement. This formula differs from the
aforementioned additive generalization of FTP representing quantum interference and is used in
the Vaxjé interpretation of the quantum formalism as a PU scheme.

We remark that, in fact, generalized ‘Vaxj6-FTP’ must not be rigidly coupled to the statistical
interpretation of the quantum state and QP. Following QBists, one can also use the subjective
interpretation.

Then, our final proposal is to proceed with the QBist subjective probability and private
experience ideology, but endowed with another PU rule—the one based on the Vaxjé version

3It is always better to cite explicitly the creators of theory.

4Of course, QBism is a grandson of Copenhagenists and the Copenhagen interpretation played the fundamental role in
establishing QBism. However, this private agent perspective is an invention of QBists, not of Copenhagenists, see the paper
of Mermin [57] for an excellent explanation of differences between QBism and Copenhagen.
