as appeared would be formed in the narrow ring of meristematic tissue situated between
the damaged apical cell and the base of the apical cone. In other shoots six to nine leaf
primordia were left round the apex, but the latter was not isolated by vertical incisions.
The data of a considerable number of experiments in which the apical cell was punctured
are available, but only a few can be selected for consideration here. For convenience, the
major findings will be briefly summarized (see figures 64 to 67, 71, plate 28).

Leaf growth. Leaf primordia already present continue to grow in'isolated meristems as
well as in those not isolated by vertical incisions.

Leaf formation. Three to seven new leaf primordia may be formed. They appear in normal
or approximately normal positions, i.e. in continuity with the existing spiral sequence; in
fact, they continue to be formed until all the available space on the meristem has been
utilized. The last-formed primordium may thus be situated close to the damaged apical
region (see also ยง8).

Bud formation. Buds are formed on the apical meristem in positions which may be de-
scribed as axillary or interfoliar. They typically occur close to the basiscopic margin of the
apical meristem, i.e. remote from the apical cell; their formation lags behind that of leaf
primordia.

Scales. These may be formed on the apical meristem in proximity to necrotic tissue. (In
the normal development they are formed along the base of the apical cone.)

Some typical specimens may now be illustrated and briefly described. The potentiality
