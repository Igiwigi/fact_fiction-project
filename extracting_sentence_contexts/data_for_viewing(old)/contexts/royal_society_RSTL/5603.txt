of wood and removed, or the whole fluid may be poured through a wet plug of cotton
in the neck of a funnel, the reduced gold pasing freely. All the vessels used in these
operations must be very clean ; though of glass they should not be supposed in proper
condition after wiping, but should be soaked in water, and after that rinsed with
distilled water. A glass supposed to be clean, and even a new bottle, is quite able to
change the character of a given gold fluid.

Fluids thus prepared may differ much in appearance. Those from the basins, or from
the stronger solutions of gold, are often evidently turbid, looking brown or violet in
different lights. Those prepared with weaker solutions and in bottles, are frequently
more amethystine or ruby in colour and apparently clear. The latter, when in their
tinest state, often remain unchanged for many months, and have all the appearance of
Solutions. But they never are such, containing in fact no dissolved, but only diffused
gold. The particles are easily rendered evident, by gathering the rays of the swn (ora
lamp) into a cone by a lens, and sending the part of the cone near the focus into the
finid; the cone becomes visible, and though the illuminated particles cannot be distin-
guished because of their minuteness, yet the light they reflect is golden in character,
and een to be abundant in proportion to the quantity of solid gold present. Portions
of fluid 80 dilute as to show no trace of gold, by colour or appearance, can have the pre-
sence of the diffused solid particles rendered evident by the sun in this way. When the
preparation is deep in tint, then common observation by reflected light shows the
suspended particles, for they produce a turbidness and degree of opacity which is suffi-
ciently evident. Such a preparation contained in a pint bottle will seem of a dull pale-
brown colour, and nearly opake by reflexion, and yet by transmission appear to be a
tine ruby, either clear or only slightly opalescent.
