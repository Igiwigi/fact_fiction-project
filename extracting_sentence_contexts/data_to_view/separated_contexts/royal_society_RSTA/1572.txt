To make the overview and reference list manageable in size, many of the original references
are omitted here, though they are included in the studies to which we refer. Furthermore, in
order to maintain an overall narrative, it may appear that one insight inevitably led to another, in
purposeful pursuit of a grand ultimate goal. That impression is erroneous: in fact, developments
occurred by investigating something that was not understood, which often revealed something
else that was relevant and not understood either; leading attention in directions that could not
necessarily have been foreseen. Productive research often follows such an unexpected path in
Earth Sciences.

3. Earthquake-depth distributions

Maggi et al. [41] noticed that the depth distribution of well-determined, moderate-sized
(Mw approximately 5.2-7.0) earthquakes on continents showed two patterns.
