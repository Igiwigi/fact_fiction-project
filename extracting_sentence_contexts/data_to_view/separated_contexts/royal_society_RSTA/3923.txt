selective darkening of the y by atmospheric action was observed in a chill of Sn 28
at 725°,

The EF Alloys. Sn 26 and 27.—This region is not marked by a singularity in the
liquidus, and in harmony with this fact the first steps in the solidification are very
similar to those of the preceding alloys. But there is a greater difference between
the composition of the first solid and that of the liquid, and consequently the y combs
of the upper chills are revealed by polishing alone through the more brilliant network
of mother-substance around them, This effect is common to the upper chills of all
the alloys as far as the point G of the diagram. This network is rapidly eaten out
by etching re-agents, leaving the unchanged y combs pale in a black network.
