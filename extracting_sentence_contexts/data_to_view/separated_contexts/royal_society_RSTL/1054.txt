The facts are already in the possession of physiolo-

new facts to our present stock of knowledge as will enable us
to unloose this Gordian knot. This attempt naturally leads us
to review the two points of the question, viz. 1s the passage of
the semen by the tubes to the ovaries, essential to impregnation ? Tf not, what other means are employed ?
