which can capture delay dynamics operating on hugely different time scales and lead to delay-
induced switched states. The mathematical studies of these slowâ€”fast systems have relevance for
optoelectronic experiments.

The remaining seven articles are related to applications where time delay systems are highly
relevant.

Hart et al. [12] review several interesting experiments and applications, which can be realized
via optoelectronic oscillators with time-delayed feedback. Examples are reservoir computing
and the experimental realization of chimera states. The authors show how the spatio-temporal
representation of time-delay systems can be used for an experimental realization of complex delay
systems via a single oscillator with delayed feedback and time-multiplexing. The advantage of
this approach lies in the fact that the complexity of the experimental set-up is manageable and the
virtual nodes of the network representing independent coupled oscillators are truly identical.

Whereas in optoelectronic oscillators the feedback is realized by a delayed electrical signal that
is injected into an electro-optic intensity modulator, the work by Lingnau et al. [13] is about the


dynamics of a laser subjected to optical feedback. In such systems, an external mirror is used to
generate an optical feedback with a significant time delay leading to the so-called external cavity
modes. The authors have analysed the stability and bifurcations of the external cavity modes in
a class-C laser, compared their results to known results for class-B lasers, and provide optimal
parameter settings for stabilizing the output.
