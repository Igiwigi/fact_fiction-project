Figure 4. AG/G for those measurements less than 100 ppm, as a function of total source mass size. The 12 data points from
left to right are the results from Tu et al. [12], Michaelis et al. [11] (tungsten), Pontikis [13], Karagioz et al. [15], Luther et al. [23],
Gundlach et al. [25], Quinn et al, [27], Quinn et al, [28], Armstrong et al. [29], R. D. Newman (2013, personal communication),

uncertainty component versus total source mass size, but this proved difficult to accomplish in
practice due to the highly individualized nature of how the uncertainty budget components were
defined and implemented in the published results across the various experiments.

In future work, we will consider carrying out a similar assessment of the test mass
configurations reported in the measurements made to date. In fact, one might ideally consider the


possibility of doing a multi-variate least-squares analysis in which the goal would be to see how
the large and small mass sizes and the overall uncertainties reported to date combined so as to
optimize signal strength versus precision in the measurement of G. It may also be possible to carry
out a study of this kind on other types of gravitational physics experiments that employ separate
configurations of source and test masses, such as torsion pendulum devices used to search for
violations of the inverse square law, composition dependence, etc. An inter-comparison of results
from a study of that nature with those from the assessment of the G experiments might be of help
in identifying some otherwise hidden systematic effect intrinsic to such measurements.
