out of the eighteen. The reason why so few of these experiments were successful is
because (1) the potato plants had grown very slowly, at first in the tropical pit and
later in the intermediate pit, and were not in a sufficiently responsive condition ; and
(2) because the temperature of the tropical pit at this time of the year is subject to
considerable variations which are dependent on cold nights, and the presence or
absence of sunlight during the day. Consequently, the external conditions are not
so favourable as in summer weather.

But the results even when negative, are instructive, and show the importance of a
high temperature, and of food material in an easily assimilable condition. For the
best intumescences were formed at a high temperature on leaves floating on sugar.
Only a few were formed on leaves floating on water if the temperature was sufficiently
high, or at a lower temperature if the leaves were supplied with sugar. These facts
support the conclusions to which my former experiments pointed, viz, that
assimilation is involved in the formation of intumescences.

The results of these earlier experiments showed that they were worth repeating
under more favourable external conditions with leaves in a more responsive state.

On June 9 the experiments were repeated with (a) potato leaves from plants
