Plate XXII. serve to show, there are periods when no such membrane is present.

CHANGES IN THE OVUM IMMEDIATELY AFTER FECUNDATION, AND BEFORE THE
OVUM LEAVES THE OVARY.

(These are represented in Plate XXIII. The ova there een were of periods varying
from 54 to 10 hours, and they measured in diameter from 45" to about 7'5".)

Changes in the Position, Form, and Internal State, of the Germinal Vesicle immedi-

germinal vesicle returns to the centre of the oyum, it is not possible to learn the
