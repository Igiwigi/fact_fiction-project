five experiments it is not unreasonable to suppose that the centre of the leaf underlying the
larger angle was effective as a centre of inhibition. It is perhaps surprising that the centre
of a leaf four plastochrons old should still inhibit effectively, but this question will be
discussed later when the nature of the inhibition will be considered. The question may be raised how it was that in the experiments of this group P, did not
inhibit J,, which was, in fact, displaced towards Ps, although it has been concluded that
P, did inhibit J, slightly. From a cut-down leaf as old as P, only a slight degree of inhibition
