On the other hand, the indulgence of
an extravagant Pyrrhoniſm may prove equally
detrimental in every.endeavour to extend the bounds
of ſcience, It may prevent the giving due weight to
matters of real information, and hinder their being
made uſeful. For my own part, I ſhould think it
an indignity offered to the Royal Society, to lay be-
fore you any extraordinary phenomenon, which is
ſupported only by a flight degree of evidence. On
the contrary, when a number of concurrent circum-
ſtances tend to eſtabliſh a fact, we ought not in a
certain degree to refuſe our aſſent to it, though ſome-
what out of the common courſe. 'Thus in the caſe
before us; when an unuſual diſeaſe of ſeveral months

be reduced to the laſt extremity; when medicines
and applications of every kind, celebrated by the

more perfect motion to torpid limbs, that had the
elecrifing been begun in March, and continued to
the end of May, though attended with the ſame ſuc-

tributing thereto. But as this was done during the
depth of winter, and that a ſeverely cold one, no ſcru-
ples, in my mind at leaft, can ariſe upon this head.
