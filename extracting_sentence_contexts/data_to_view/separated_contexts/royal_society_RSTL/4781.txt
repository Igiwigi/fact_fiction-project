These crystals are permanent as
long as they are protected from the action of the moist air. After disconnecting the
apparabus, it is vain to attempt to collect the crystals, the most minute quantity of water
causing them to liquefy to a heavy oil, soluble in water. From these remarks, it is
obvious that triethylphosphine must be almost always contaminated with a small quan-
tity of this substance ; in fact a bottle containing the base cannot be opened without
its being formed. When the phosphorus-base is brought in contact with oxygen,
vapours are immediately formed ; the liquid frequently becomes s0 hot that it inflames,
and the body is burnt with evolution of dense white fumes of phosphoric acid. If a
strip of paper, moistened with triethylphosphine, be introduced into a test-tube contain-
ing oxygen and immersed into hot water, the vapour of the phosphorus-base produces
with the oxygen an explosive mixture, which detonates after a few moments with con-
siderable violence.
