Proposition 5.6. For n > A > 1, we have the following results.

(1) For A=1,Mj1(Fq) =1and M;; =1.
(2) For A=2, we have

1
Mo 9(F,) =2 — 7

(3) Forn > A> 3, we have

Ma,A(Fq) =A! —

A(A — 1A! 1
qo (3)

Proof. Assertion (1) is immediate from the fact that #V(1, 1, 7)(F,) =q. Assertion (2) is immediate
from the fact that #V(2,2,n)(Fq) =2q(q —1)+q= 2q7 —4q. For n > A > 3, we break up V(A,A,1)(F,) by the number d of distinct coordinates x, in a point.
