Summarising the results of this experiment, the thalamic lesion on the right side is
limited to the ventral nucleus, the medial geniculate body, and some of the fibres of the
optic radiations. The distribution of Marchi degeneration in the cortex of this side

reaching from the rhinal fissure below to the dorsal margin of the area striata and up to
the dorsal region of the parietal area above. The absence of Marchi degeneration in the
cingular area and in the most dorsal part of the parietal area is related to the fact that
