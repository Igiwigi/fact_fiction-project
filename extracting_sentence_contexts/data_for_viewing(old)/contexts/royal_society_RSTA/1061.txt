in the case of TR-SFX compared to the Laue method. Furthermore, analysis of the reaction 1g
initiation fractions indicated photoactive populations as large as 40% for TR-SFX, three to four : s

times larger than that achieved with Laue synchrotron measurements; this was attributed to the
increased size of the crystals required for Laue possessing such large optical density than optical
pulses cannot penetrate the entire crystal let alone lead to uniform illumination. Another very
important consideration is that the SFX method at XFELs is a single-shot technique, and that
each crystal is fresh and not previously exposed. This removes the accumulating background
differences as well as fall-off of intensity and resolution that would be caused by repeated laser
excitation and X-ray exposure of the same crystal volume. Interestingly, the increased sensitivity
to light-induced differences using the SFX method was in fact not readily predicted before the
first convincing demonstrations for a number of reasons. Firstly, pump-induced structure factor
amplitude differences AF are typically smaller than noise particularly with ultrafast excitation,
such that the inverse Fourier transform after appropriate phasing of the data accumulates electron
density differences to statistically significant levels in real space in well-correlated cases. The
level of correlation between repeated measurements is increased by the lack of background from
damage, but may be increased by inhomogeneity of crystal size and the level of isomorphicity.
Another consideration is the strong fluctuation of the X-ray spectrum of the XFEL in SASE
mode, its typical 40eV bandwidth, as well as the small divergence relative to typical values
for mosaic spread of protein crystals, considering typical focusing angles of 0.12-0.25 mrad used
for SFX. These characteristics were previously investigated from single-crystal datasets with an
application of a quasi-rotation method at the LCLS in the beginning period of exploring the XFEL-
based protein crystallography results [16]. In addition, the absence of significant convergence
