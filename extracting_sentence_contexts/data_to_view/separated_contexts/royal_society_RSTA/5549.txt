Moreover,

for d x d square matrices A, B, we denote by A: B = trace(A - Bl)= via Aj Bii-
In a compact domain with no boundary (basically the torus Q = (R/(LZ))*), using the
divergence free condition, one deduces from (1.2) the equation:

— Ap =(Vx @ Vx): (u® u), (1.3)

which uniquely determines the pressure (up to a constant) and also determines its regularity in
terms of the regularity of the tensor (u ® u). For instance, for u € Ck (2), standard Hélder elliptic
regularity (cf. [1] chapter 3 or [2] chapter 3) states that for any integer k > 0, p belongs also to the
space C*(Q). In the presence a boundary 4, taking the scalar product with the interior normal
ni of the first equation of (1.2), one obtains, now for k > 2, the relation:

d :2

— 05p = > dj(ujuj)n;j =(u@u): Vn, ond. (1.4) : S

ij=1 [3

In (1.4), the second identity follows from the fact that u is tangential to the boundary 02, (i.e. DG
u-n=0 on 92 which is a level surface of the scalar function u - 7). On 02, Vii is called the aa
Weingarten matrix.
