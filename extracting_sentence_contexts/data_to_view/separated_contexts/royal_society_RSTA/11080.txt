Ann.,’ 42, p. 18, 1891) concluded from the results of his
experiments that the conductivity of salt vapours in flames is due to partial ionisation
of the salt by the high temperature of the flame, and that the conductivity of a flame
containing a salt vapour is very analogous to the conductivity of an aqueous solution
of the salt. In our paper referred to above we have not seen any reason to doubt the
general accuracy of ARRHENIUS’ conclusions. There are, however, a number of important facts which do not readily lend
themselves to explanation by the hypothesis just mentioned. The phenomena of
unipolar conduction are among these. Hrrrorr (see WIEDEMANN’S ‘ Elektricitiit,’
vol. 4 B) showed that the current depends very greatly on the negative electrode,
and that it is greater when a bead of salt in the flame is near the negative electrode
: than when it is near the positive electrode, and he concluded that nearly all the
resistance to the passage of the current is at or near to the surface of the negative
electrode, at any rate in the case of flames free from salt vapour.
