where kp is the effective plasma wavenumber, related to the plasma frequency wp as kp = p/c,
and k, is the x component of the wavenumber of plane waves propagating inside the medium
sample. Using the definition of permittivity, D = «gE + P = cE, the same can be expressed in the
form of a relation between the macroscopic (volume-averaged) electric field E, along x and the
electric polarization density P, as

This relation has the same form as the averaged boundary condition for a single-layer wire
grid (2.1). The phenomenon of strong spatial dispersion in wire arrays results from the fact that
electromagnetic waves can propagate along the wires at arbitrarily long distances (neglecting
dissipation) as in a multi-conductor transmission line. Interestingly, this property of volumetric
wire media as epsilon-negative and spatially dispersive metamaterials was realized only about
10 years ago [16], while the spatially dispersive averaged boundary condition for single-layer
wire meshes (metasurfaces, according to the current terminology) have been known from the
mid-twentieth century [12].

Also the notion of an infinitely thin sheet as a material slab with negligible thickness was
used in electromagnetics for a long time. The idea of using infinitely thin current sheets to
model layers of conventional volumetric materials probably stems from the impedance boundary
conditions modelling interfaces with good conductors, introduced in 1940 [17-19]. Owing to a
very high value of the refractive index || in metals at microwave frequencies, the induced electric
