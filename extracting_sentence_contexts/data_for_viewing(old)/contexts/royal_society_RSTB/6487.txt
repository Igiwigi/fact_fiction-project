Transference of Particles along the Hindgut—The ciliation of the hindgut was found
to be exactly the same as that of the oesophagus.

Loose faecal particles are mixed with a copious secretion of mucus from the gut
wall, and carried down the hindgut in the three tracts A, B and B’. As in the oeso-
phagus, since A, B and B’ are close together, the number of particles present is usually
large enough to bring about coalescence of the three tracts to form a single bolus of
faeces.

Movement of Particles in the Caecum (see fig. 19)—The caecum is ciliated throughout,
but its small size and delicate structure, and the fact that it lies deeply embedded
in the digestive gland, renders excision of the intact structure impossible. Consequently
it is here that the method of studying ciliary action from sections of fixed material has
proved most valuable and the following account of the ciliation has been entirely
deduced by this method.

The cilia round the opening of the caecum into the midgut beat inwards (heavy
arrows, fig. 19), thus drawing all particles in the vicinity of the opening into the
caecum. The majority of these particles are swept on to the ridges at the back of the
caecum.

The ciliation of these ridges and their complementary grooves is perfectly uniform.
The cilia on the summit of each ridge beat along the main axis of the ridge and
