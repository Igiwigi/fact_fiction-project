The type of instability which ensues when Condition B is not satisfied may be called
non-precesstonal instability, since it occurs when one of the two modes of precession is of very
low frequency. It is also known by the more special names of vertex instability or overstability
since it is clear that | £r| gcosa/V°% will be large (a) near the vertex when the velocity V is
least and cosa +1, and (6) when the spin is very great. In fact

is the so-called vertex yaw. We now examine the Condition C for stability. Just as in the case of Condition B, this
condition will not be important except over long distances, since otherwise

will remain small.
