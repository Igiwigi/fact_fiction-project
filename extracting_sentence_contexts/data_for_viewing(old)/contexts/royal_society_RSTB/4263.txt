The cause of this symptom I have not been able to determine as yet. The salivary
secretion was found to be increased by Gunn (13), but Yaar is not able to confirm his
statement. And there was no very obyious increase of the saliva, such as is seen
under pilocarpine, for though the lips were often moistened, there was no actual flow
from the mouth. It is possible, therefore, that the saliva reached the respiratory
passages not from its being secreted in excess but from the paresis of the muscles of
the pharynx and larynx, which prevented its being swallowed. This would indicate
that the nerve ends in these muscles are weakened very early in the action, before
any distinct change can be made out in the respiratory muscles proper, but not before
there is paresis of the eyelid muscles, permitting the upper lid to fall slightly. This
passage of saliva into the larynx would not be serious in normal animals, but in the
weakened condition of the respiratory muscles forms a considerable obstruction to the
breathing. Its import is shown by the fact that tracheotomy restores the respiration
in rabbits, at any rate temporarily in some cases. At the same time, tracheotomy by
shortening the respiratory passages may increase the efficiency of the feeble move-
ments of the thorax. The unusual moisture of the lungs and the infaretion which is
often met with appear to arise from the saliva insufflated.

It is necessary to consider shortly how far the symptoms of cobra poisoning in man
correspond with those seen in animals and whether they conform to the type of
curara action. It may be premised that in man there are, in addition to the typical
effects, marked symptoms from the local irritation and many symptoms from shock
and fear; the importance of these has been pointed out by Fayrer, who describes a
ease in which the patient died of fear after being bitten by a non-poisonous snake,
which he believed to be poisonous.
