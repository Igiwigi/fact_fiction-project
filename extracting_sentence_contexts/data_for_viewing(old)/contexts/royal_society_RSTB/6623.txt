in and passing the mass backward by muscular movements of the visceral skeleton.
The small original mouth proved inadequate and its corners migrated backward,
crushing out of existence or absorbing the profundus gill slit, and ultimately settling
down at the trigeminal gill slit. The skeleton of the gill septum lying between the

trigeminal and facial gill slits, which consisted of a single chain of four elements, the
pharyngo-, epi-, cerato- and hypo-branchial cartilages or bones, thus came to be
related to the mouth, and its musculature enabled it to be used as a jaw. In fact it
becomes the palato-quadrate and Meckelâ€™s cartilage. At this stage the facialis or
hyoid gill slit obviously remains of its original size and structure; it was identical in all
its important features with the glossopharyngeal gill slit. This is the primitive Gnatho-
stome condition. Continuation of the process of lengthening the mouth, subsequent
to the establishment of a definite jaw skeleton, will clearly tend to occlude the middle
of the hyoid gill slit by bringing the articular region of the jaws into contact with the
main articular region of the hyoid arch. If this contact be established the hinder end
of the long jaw will gain a much-needed support through the upper part of the hyoid
arch skeleton, a hyomandibular being established and a small relic of the dorsal
extremity of the hyoid gill slit surviving as the spiracle. The ventral part of this gill slit
would vanish entirely, probably for some reason depending on the time rates of
development of the structures involved. This condition is that found in all living fish,
