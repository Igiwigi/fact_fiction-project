than in its centre, and containing branched cells of the pyramidal type. The cells
are rather larger than those which are scattered uniformly throughout the corpus
striatum, about 11 p broad by 15 mw long, with apical, basal, and axis-cylinde
processes; but partly because the tissue, although in many places well preserved,

is hardly fit for accurate histological work, and partly because the shape of the cells
depends upon the plane in which they happen to be cut, I do not propose to draw
far-reaching conclusions from apparent differences in minute structure.

More interesting than its minute structure is the fact that this tissue passes over
at the ventro-mesial angle of the hemisphere into the corpus striatum, without the
possibility of any line of demarcation being drawn between them.

Tt would appear, therefore, that the grey matter which lies on the inner side of the

hemisphere is a part of the same formation as the nucleus caudatus. This reduces
She latter very distinctly to the level of a cortical formation, differing morphologically
rom other parts of the cortex in the absence of a white coat. The grey matter of
She corpus striatum lies on the axial side of the rhinencephalon, which in turn lies
Sn the axial side of the pallium.
eB This grey formation reaches almost as far forwards as the ventricle, but projects in
gfront of the part common to it and the corpus striatum as a rounded boss. Con-
