The cylinder of wood as it becomes gradually
immersed *, continually furnishes an equiyalent to the repulsion, in the quan-
tity of water displaced. We do not generally perceive the attractive effect resulting from this indue-
tive action in non-ferruginous masses; for, as already observed, their feeble
retentive power admits of the magnetic neutrality being more rapidly restored,
when the tension passes a certain point. So that in fact, the opposite magnetic
state never becomes sufficiently intense to evince an attractive force, cogni-
zable by the ordinary means.

* Amore detailed account of this experiment may be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh. OF WHICH VARIOUS SUBSTANCES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE. 89

under a suspended magnetic bar, opposite poles are induced in that part of the
disc immediately under the bar ; these induced poles may be supposed to pass on,
and being retained for a short portion of time, will, if the motion be more rapid
than the time during which the impression remains, be transferred toward the
opposite poles of the magnet, and exert upon them a repulsive action up to
that point of distance (35) at which the poles of the magnet again reverse the
transient poles impressed on the disc, and substitute opposite poles, to be
again reyersed as before.
