These ideas, especially as popularized by the Englishman Henry Buckle’s History of Civilization,
rippled through the educated world and proved to be vital for the development of statistical
mechanics. Boltzmann and Maxwell both—apparently independently (in this paragraph I rely
on [8]: 111ff)}—used the analogy to individuals to explain their reasoning as they developed
the statistical mechanics of gases. Boltzmann proposed that ‘The molecules are like so many
1A similar confusion also arises for some in the fact that the classes of indistinct states that are the ‘most probable’ (in that they
are most likely to be observed) are not necessarily those with the highest ‘probability’ (greatest entropy), since there may be

more equivalent configurations that lead to somewhat lower entropy states than the single possible macrostate of maximum
entropy. It is unlikely that we would get something that likely.

2Excellent sources for the history of statistics and the relation across sciences are Stigler [5], Hacking [6], and the various
essays collected in Kruger, Daston & Heidelberger [7]. However, my chief source for the relation between thermodynamics
and social statistics is Porter [8].


individuals, having the most various states of motion, and the properties of gases only remain
unaltered because the number of these molecules which on the average have a given state of
motion is constant.
