If the
activity is supposed to be measured by the # rays, the upper curve A, fig. 7, is
similar to that shown in fig. 6. The lower curve of fig. 7 is, however, again different
from the corresponding B-ray curve shown in fig. 5. I think the difference between the results of Curre and DANNE and those obtained
by myself lies in the fact that the former did not take into account that the shape of
the curves depended on whether the « or 8 rays were used as a means of measure-
ment. Curt and Dane do not state, or give any evidence to show, which of the types
of rays they employed for measurement, but I think there is no doubt that the lower

curve (fig. 1) was obtained by means of the « rays, while the four upper curves (fig. 7)
were obtained by means of the 8 rays.
