cit.) himself only described the air-bladder and the
ossicles which bear his name in a single species (Silurms glanis), Jowanxes MOtien,
in his yarious contributions to the Berlin Academy during the years 1848-45, added
somewhot to our knowledge of these structures, and notably by bis discovery of the
*elastic-spriug” apparatus, but Miiturr’s attention was mainly directed to the
grosser features in the anatomy of the air-bladder, to the entire exclusion of all Lait
the slightest reference to the important skeletal modifications which are associated
with the peculiar structure of that organ in the Siluridm, or to the auditory ossicles,
Rusesyne ($2) has given a fairly complete account of the singular bone-encapsuled
nir-bladder of Rhinelepis, but among the most valuable of recent contributions to this
branch of vertebrate morphology are the papers by Professor Ramsay Wien
relating to the aberrant Siluroid Wypophthalmus (44), and to the more normal North
American species Amiurns catus (42, 48), to which reference will subsequently be
mide. In this connexion reference may also be made to the numerous scattered
references to the air-bladder of the Indian Siluridw contained t» the papers of the
late Dr. Frawcts Day (9, 10), which, although often too brief, in sevetal instances
at any rate are yaluable as throwing some light on the degenerate condition of that
organ in certain rare abnormal forms. It is remarkable that this important femily of Fishes has so little occupied the
attention of morphologists, especially when we take inte consideration the interesting
moilifications which its yarious merbers have undergone, and tlie fact that im this
funily the air-bladder and “auditory " ossicles are subject to greaver yariations, and
rire mors highly specialized than in any other group of Ostariophyse, Probably the
inain reason why the Silnridm have been so much neglected is due to the fact that

they are pringipally tropical in habitat, or live in remote and inqccessible districts,
Toyestigators at home ure consequently dependent upon the exertions of collectors,
who, as a rule, do not pay much attention to Fishes, and the relatively few species
which do find their way to Enrope are reynived for museum specimens, Fortunately
for us we had the opportunity of purchasing the third series of the Siluroids collected
hy that eminent iehihyologist, the late Dr, BLenker, who had amassed a magnificent
collection of Nast Indian Fishes, amongst which the Siluridse were well represented. Subsequently we added to our collection what other spechnens we wore able to
procure, especially African and South American species. The object of the present communication is to give the results of a detailed study
of the morphology of the air-bladder, and “auditory” ossicles, and the associated
skeletal modifications in 100 species of Siluridm, referable to 51 genera, and mainly
belonging to Dr, Gistatr’s sub-tamilies of Silwidse Honialoptere, S$. Heteropterm,
