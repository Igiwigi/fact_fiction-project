tions obtained for successive (overlapping) 8-week periods, in respect of which Hooxrr
draws the following conclusions (p. 120) :—

“ Looking first at the curve showing the connection between rain and wheat,
the most striking features are the dips about October and in winter, both very nearly
identical. As a matter of fact the winter dip is slightly greater than the other. But no weight can be attached to so slight a difference, and we must apparently regard
a dry seed-time and a dry subsequent winter as about of equal importance. Sir
Narrer SHAw appears to have been the first to call attention to the great advantage
of a dry autumn, and my calculations fifteen years ago pointed to this period being
more important than the winter.
