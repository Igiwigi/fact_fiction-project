It is known that models suffer from a variety of biases, especially in the Labrador Sea and
subpolar North Atlantic, and some of these can be addressed by increasing the resolution
of the ocean component to capture eddy processes, though at higher latitudes this becomes
more challenging due to the decrease in Rossby radius [61]. Other biases like those due to the
representation of deep overflows may be harder to deal with, and the biases may be model
dependent. Thus, both higher resolution models and new model developments are required
to better represent the AMOC. In terms of future projections, a way forward may be to use
observational constraints to sub-select models and model ensemble members using history
matching [49], as has recently been done in studying future Arctic sea ice decline [62].

With regard to paleo modelling, one way forward is to use data assimilation to make best use
of the sparse paleo data that are available. This requires careful determination of uncertainties
in both the paleo observations and the models, and an awareness of the fact that different
paleo proxies constrain different aspects of the overturning. It remains unclear whether insights
for paleo modelling will be helpful in determining the near-term (centennial) changes in the
AMOC [50].

As noted earlier, some of the climatic impacts of AMOC changes are mediated via the AMV,
so understanding the AMOC-AMV link is an important issue [63]. A particular challenge in
modelling the AMV, and its associated impacts, is the large uncertainty in the magnitude of the
simulated historical forcing, specifically the anthropogenic aerosol forcing.
