The groups are various, including in (a) 257/16 and 1200/2: in (6), where a direct
comparison is possible, the E-ness does not differ from that of F, and F, which are
not back-crossed.

The chief conclusion which can be drawn from this series of facts is that a high <
strain does not usually come out as such in F,, F, and F, of crosses with A dextral or
K sinistral snails. Occasionally it may do so, especially in F, and F,, and this E-ness
may often be enhanced by selecting a brood with many dextrals to carry on: high
E-ness can in this way emerge from a cross in which the original E parent came from
a heterogeneous strain (p. 80) of only moderate H-ness. There is some inconclusive
evidence that E-ness comes out higher on the E side of the cross than on the A side, and
it seems almost certain that high E-ness comes out better from a cross with a Stelfox
