acid.

I have referred, in the Philosophical Transactions, to the
combination of chlorine and sulphur. I have been able to form
no compound of these bodies, which does not deposit sulphur
by the action of water. When sulphur is saturated with chlo-
rine, as in Dr, Twowson's sulphuretted liquor, it appears to
contain, from my experiments, only 67 of chlorine to go of

su]phur.
4. Some general Observalions.

It is a fact worthy of notice, that phosphoric and sulphuric
acids should contain the same quantity of oxygene to the same
quantity of inflammable matter; and yet that the oxygene should
be combined in them, with such different degrees of affinity.
Phosphorous acid has a great tendency to unite with oxygene,
and absorbs it even from water : and sulphureous acid can only
retain it when water is present.

The relation of water to the composition of many bodies has
already occupied the attention of some distinguished chemists,
and is well worthy of being further studied ; most of the sub-
stances obtained by precipitation from aqueous solutions are, I
find, compounds of water.
