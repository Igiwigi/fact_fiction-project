may be matter of inquiry how it is that the heat evolved within the body of the insect,
during respiration, becomes evident 80 rapidly. This, it may be urged, tends to show
that it results from the influence of the neryous system. But when we remember
that in insects the circulatory vessels are in close and most extensive communication
with the respiratory organs over the whole body of the individual, and that, unlike
the vessels in those vertebrated warm-blooded animals which have extensive respira-
tion, they are neither strictly venous nor arterial, but probably intermediate between
the two, may it not arise from only a very s8mall amount of heat evolved at each re-
spiration becoming latent, while nearly the whole becomes free, and is liberated as
quickly as produced, and that this is the occasion of the temperature of the insect
being 80 quickly raised during its respiration, and s0 rapidly diminished as the acts
of respiration become less frequent ? That, in other words, in insects the capacity of
the blood for caloric is but very little increased during respiration? With these facts
in consideration, and looking at the analogical condition of insects, and with Pro-
fessor GranTÂ® and Mr. Owgx+f, comparing the vast extent of their respiratory organs,
distributed over the whole body, with a like extensive respiration in birds, and finding
that, like birds, insects have also a greater activity of respiration, and a higher tem-
perature of body than any other class in the division of animals unto which they re-
spectively belong, we can hardly withhold our assent to the opinions which have long
been advocated by many of our best physiologists, that animal heat is the direct result
of the chemical changes which take place in the air respired. But it may be urged
that activity of respiration is coincident with increased rapidity of circulation, and
hence that the latter may, perhaps, precede the former, and be in reality the source
of heat. Unto this it may be replied that the larya in its earlier state has a more
rapid circulation, but develops less heat than in its latter. In many of the obserya-
