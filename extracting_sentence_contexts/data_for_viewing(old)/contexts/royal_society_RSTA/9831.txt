The satellite separation of 82°11 must therefore be caused by a denominator difference
which is also a multiple of 4,. If this be tested, it is found at once that only the first
and last of the above set can satisfy this condition, 30819 taking 240, or 6d, and
29465 taking 28, or 73. The corresponding values for Cu and Ag are both 239,.
The differences between the values calculated from the lines and from the multiples
of 3, are (p between +1 giving the observation error in D,, (2)).

38°44+288+3'0y+14p—22q with 246, = 8441
20+34'3s+4y+17p—26q ,, 288, = 9869.

It is clear that either can easily be made to vanish well within possible errors,
more especially the latter. The limit 30819 is higher than that of Ag instead of
lower as might be inferred from the fact that the limit of Ag is lower than that of Cu.
The limit 29465 is 1179 below that of Ag, which is itself 931 below that of Cu.
This seems a probable order of magnitude, especially when it is remembered that there
is a gap in the Periodic Table between Ag and Au. But there is further evidence in
favour of the latter. If the lines 6278°37, 5064°75 are collaterals of D (2) as the
corresponding lines in Cu and Ag appear to be, 6278°37 should be D,, (2) (a9,).
With the limit 30819 this cannot possibly be the case. The oun d, = 351 is so large
that there can be no doubt. If however the limit is 29465, the line is D,, (2) (A+1549).
Further, with neither limit is the mantissa of D (2) a multiple of 3, and as this is also
not the case with Ag or Cu, it may be regarded that in this group either these lines
are not of the D type, or possibly like the high melting-point elements of Group IT.
the first lines correspond to m=1 and not m=2. The actual values of the
denominators as found are so close to the same value for all three elements as to
