And C,, and C,, derived from & describes the monopole. This demonstrates that
the standard model does have the 72(S‚Äù) monopole topology. In fact, the Abelian decomposition of the standard model tells that the standard model and the
George-Glashow model has the same SU(2) monopole topology. This is evident from (2.26) and
(2.32), where exactly the same magnetic potential C,, represents the monopole topology. The only
difference is that the standard model has an extra U(1)y interaction which can have the Abelian
monopole topology.
