As well as rationalizing the metallic versus non-metallic status of the chemical elements.
under ambient conditions, the Goldhammer-Herzfeld model obviously allows one to predict the
critical conditions under which a metallic element can become non-metallic or, conversely, a non-
metallic element can acquire metallic status. Pioneering studies by Strutt [32] and by Bender [33]
in the early part of the last century explored the experimental conditions under which the element
mercury was transformed from a metal—surely its recognized, universal status as a magnificent
conductor of electricity—to a stubbornly resistive insulator or non-metal. Thus, Strutt noted

It is known that mercury vapour, even at very high temperatures, is a good insulator; a
better one in fact than air under similar conditions. Liquid mercury, on the other hand,
is of course a good conductor, like other metals. He further noted Since the liquid and
saturated vapour are indistinguishable above the critical temperature, one or both of these
(states) must undergo a remarkable change of electrical properties as that temperature is
approached [32].
