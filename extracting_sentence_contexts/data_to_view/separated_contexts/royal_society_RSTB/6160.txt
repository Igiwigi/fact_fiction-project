This, however, appears improbable. Whether O. paralamarckiana is a hybrid of O. Lamarckiana or not, the fact remains
that it has survived under natural conditions at Penzance for a period of some
25 years, and therefore appears to be entitled to recognition as a wild species unless
it can be shown to be of hybrid origin. O. Lamarckiana has never been found wild
in America, except a small clump of plants found by the senior author in company
with Professor Martg-Vicrorin, at Lotbini√©re in Quebec Province, October, 1932.
