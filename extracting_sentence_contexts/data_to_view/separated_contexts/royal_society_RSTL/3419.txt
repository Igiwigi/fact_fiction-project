One erythrolein, Erythrolitmine. C;, Hy, Ou = Cy Hy O, + Cy Hy, Oy,

The erythrolein, I consider, may then absorb oxygen and form erythroleic acid,
which will be again broken up and ultimately all converted into the final term ery-
throlitmine. In the commencement, therefore, the erythroleic acid is tolerably per-
manent until the roccelline is all exhausted; and indeed its permanency is promoted
by the fact that in making archil too rapid an oxidation might do much harm, the
alphaorceine being a richer colour than the betaorceine. But in making litmus it is
decomposed, and whilst the great mass rapidly forms erythrolitmine, small quantities
of erythrolein appear to escape the action of the air. Finally, to 8um up the results of this part of the investigation, I look upon these
three bodies as all derived from roccelline; but notwithstanding the beautiful simplicity
of their formulz, which would appear to indicate them to be all oxides of one com-
pound radical, which contained C,; Hy,, I look upon them as, when once formed,
being quite independant of each other : thus, if erythrolitmine was erythrolein
+ eight oxygen, we should be able, by deoxidizing means, to change erythrolitmine
into erythrolein ; this cannot be done, and hence, as will be shown more fully when
describing the results of decolorization of these bodies, I look upon each as having an
internal constitution distinct from either of the others.
