122 BEN DAWES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

The tissue of the cranial sclerotomite consists of loosely arranged cells, except on the
anterior border of the intrasclerotomic fissure, where in the dorsal half of the segment
there is a slight condensation of cells, and in the region between each dorsal ganglion
and the corresponding ventral root, where densely crowded cells constitute a definite
formation. This formation, lying in the cranial sclerotomite immediately in front of
the membranous basidorsal and immediately behind the intersegmental blood vessels,
must correspond to the membranous forerunner of the Interdorsal (vide previous
footnote). In view of the fact that a formation appears later in the dorsal half of the
cranial sclerotomite, but below this structure, it must represent the dorsalmost part
of the interdorsal and hence will be referred to in subsequent description as the Dorsal-
interdorsal. The intrasclerotomic fissure is even more pronounced than in the previous
stage, extending almost throughout the sclerotome.

The ventral part of the Ist cervical sclerotome is even at this stage much more
considerably developed than the corresponding part of more posteriorly situated seg-
ments. It is composed of a larger number of cells, occupies a greater volume and
extends slightly further ventrally. In this segment the dorsal ganglia and the ventral
nerve roots are not associated as they are in other segments. Dorsal nerve roots have
not yet appeared in any region.
