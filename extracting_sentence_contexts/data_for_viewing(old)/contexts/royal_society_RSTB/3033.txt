in a subterranean water in Tasmania, has been examined by Mr, G. M. THomson
(1894) and Dr. Carman (1896). In particular, the researches of the latter have
rendered the position of Anaspides one of great interest to carcinologists.
Dr. CauMAN has pointed out that Anaspides is probably a synthetic type of a kind
met with in Palezoic rocks. It combines with a Schizopodâ€™s feet, a Decapod auditory
organ ; like Amphipods or Isopods it has no carapace, and yet possesses stalked eyes.
Thanks to Professor Howes and to Dr. CaAtman, we have been able to examine
preserved specimens of Anaspides, and we have found traces both of a centralised
and of a peripheral system of chromatophores (Plate 23, fig. 52). Opposite
to the base of each pair of appendages and closely applied to the nerve-cord,
there is an unpaired chromatophore-centre from which long branches run up the
body-wall and down the endopod of the limb, very much as in Mysis the branches
of the neutral group of centres supply these two organs. In fact, this is the neural
group. It is centralised, segmental, and has the far reaching branches of the
Mysidee. In addition to these chromatophores, there are hexagonal plates of pigment
on the skin of the abdominal pleura, and more deeply placed pigment-masses in the
mid-dorsal line of each segment. The former appear to be superticial deposits of
pigment and not chromatophores, the latter may be caudal centres, but are not
sufticiently well-preserved for us to pronounce upon them. The presence, however,
of a neural group suggests affinity with Mysis, whilst the presence of scattered
apparently functionless pigment-spots might be taken to indicate a Decapod or
Amphipod character. In the absence of living specimens, it is difficult to deseribe
or define the characters of the chromatophore-system more fully, but the conclusion
that the system shows a Mysidean character, agrees with that drawn by Dr. Catman
