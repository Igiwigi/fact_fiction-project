It would be perhaps too hasty to assert, that gelatin was thus
absolutely formed ; but, if a substance 'so very similar to it
could be thus produced, we may with some reason conclude,
that the real gelatin, with its various modifications, is formed
from albumen, by the more efficacious and delicate operations of
nature, In attempting to prove that albumen or the coagulating lymph
is the original animal substance, I have hitherto only stated
chemical facts; but, when the phenomena attending incubation
are considered; when the experiments made by eminent physio-
logists, such as HarLer, MaiTRE JEAN, and MALP1GH1, are
viewed; when the oviparous foetus is seen to be progressively
formed in and from the albumen of the egg, so that, upon the
bursting of the shell which separated it from external matter,
the young animal comes forth complete in all its parts; when
such strong facts as these are corroborated by those afforded
by chemistry, it can scarcely be doubted that albumen is the
primary animal substance, from which the others are derived;
and there is much cause to believe that the formation of gelatin,
and of the animal fibre especially, begins with the process of
sanguification in the foetus. As the three principal and essential component parts of the
blood, viz. albumen, gelatin, and fibre,* appear therefore to
