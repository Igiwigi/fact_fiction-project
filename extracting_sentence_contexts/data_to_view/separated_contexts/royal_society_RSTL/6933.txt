Theſe obſervations may feem ar firſt view to claſh
with and contradict thoſe 1 have related : But, upon
cloſer conſideration, they will be found in reality to
confirm them, for this reaſon, to wit, that puppies
and colts, when brought forth, have no looſe hairs
on their bodies.; but calves have in great numbers. In the puppies and colt, which I examined, the
hairs were ſo firmly rooted on their {kins, that I could
ſcarce pull any off with my thumb and fingers ;
whereas in a ripe calf, new brought forth, many are
found quite looſened at their roots, and only adher-

ing


[ 261 ]
Ing to their ſkin by the moiſture on it. Therefore
in the latter ſpecies, hairs from the ſurface may be,
and aQtually are, incorporated with the liquor amnii,
and along with it enter the mouth and alimentary
canal, which cannot be the caſe in the former,

From theſe facts it is eaſy to draw ſuch inferences,
as are ſufficient to decide the controverſy, which we
are treating of ; and prove inconteſtably, that the li-
quor amnil is in a conſtant natural way received into
the mouth, ſtomach, and inteſtines, and therefore
muſt contribute to the nutrition of the fetus. For if we attentively conſider, that in the meco-
nium of an human fetus no hairs are found, there
being no looſe hairs on its ſkin when it is born ;
that in the meconium of unripe calves there are
none, before they are of ſo long continuance on their
bodies as to be looſened, and float in the liquor am-
nit; whereas in that of the ripe calves they are
found in great abundance, of the ſame colour with
thoſe of the ſkin, as appears by the example we had
occafion to examine moſt particularly ; and of ſuch
a length, ſtiffneſs, and thickneſs, and fo conſtantly
to be met with, as cannot with any ſhew of reaſon
'be imputed either to morbid concretion, or preter-
natural frame : If, I fay, all theſe fats are atten-
tively conſidered, and duly weighed, the concluſion
I have drawn will, I hope, appear to follow from
them ſo naturally, that no candid and intelligent in-
quirer will call its truth in queſtion,

After I had gone thus far upon my own bottom,
and while I was looking about me, in order to pick

up more proofs, that might, as it were ex /uperabun-
danti, confirm and illuſtrate the doQrine, which I
was endeavouring to eſtabliſh, before I ſhould ven-
ture to publiſh it, I caſually found what, as I here
ſolemnly declare, I knew nothing of before, to wit,
that I was not the firſt, who had obſerved hairs in
the meconium of ripe calves, two authors having
been before-hand with me, to wit, Aldes and Swam-
merdam ; the former in his Epr/tola contra Harveium,
publiſhed in the firſt volume of the Bibliotheca Ana-
tomica of Mangetus and Le Clerc : the latter in the
Biblia Nature, Aldes, a feigned name under
which Slade, an Amſterdam phylician, conceals him-
{clf, barely mentions the obſervation, without draw-
ing any inference from it, either on the one fide
or the other. Swammerdam draws the ſame con-
cluſion with me; but, I think, he goes farther
than the obſervation can well juſtify, maintaining,
that it evidently follows from thgnce, that a calf
licks his own fkin in utero, thereby looſening the
hairs, and ſwallowing them down along with the
liquor amnii, its nouriſhment.
