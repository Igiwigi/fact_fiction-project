And in latitude 72,23, having examined the temperature of
the sea at the depth of 500, 600, 700, 8oo and 1000 fathoms, he found that it graÂ»
dually decreased from 359 to 284 (Appendix, page cxxiv.), These differences,
though not $0 considerable as that above related, all concur in establishing the ge-
neral fact, that the lower strata, in that particular track of the northern ocean, are
colder than the surface, The instrument which Captain Ross employed, was a regis-
ter-thermometer, the indications of which were occasionally compared with the tempe-
rature of the mud and earthy fragments of various kinds which he raised from the
bottom of the sea, by an appropriate instrument of his own contrivance z as this mud,
both trom the quantity raised, and from the mannerin which it was confined, retain-
ed its temperature for a sufficient length of time not to be materially altered on reach=
ing the surface,


of sea waters, in different parts of the ocean, &c. 185 On the other hand, Lieut. Paxxy, who had the command of
the ship Alexander, in Captain Ross's expedition (and is
now appointed commander of the second expedition to Baffin's
Bay), fully confirms the observations made by Captain Ross,
and also by Captain SaBInEe,* on board Captain Ross's ship;
80 as to place beyond all doubt the fact of Batfin's Bay being
colder at the bottom than it is at the surface.f

But although these points may be considered as satisfac-

torily established, it must be admitted that the various modes

* Captain SaBinz has been 5 obliging as to furnish me with a table containing
some of his observations on the subject, which will be found in the Appendix. + Captain Py1ees als states in his Journal (Appendix, page 142), that he found
the temperature in Baftin's Bay, at the depth of 680 fathoms, as low as 40o, the
Surface being 559, and the air 6639,

Other observers have obtained, in other seas, analogous results.
