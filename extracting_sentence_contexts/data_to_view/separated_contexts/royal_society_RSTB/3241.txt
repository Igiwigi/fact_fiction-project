latter fact was confirmed by Mout (3) in 1876. (And I may here add that my
observations on the epidermis of Lamium album yield the same result.)

In 1878 Askenasy (4) added the information that, in some cases, the first inter-
nodes of an axis are the longest. In 1883 Maccuratr made observations on Lonicera chinensis, which Wiesner (5)
describes in the following words: “Here a remarkable case occurs, namely, that,
independent of external circumstances, the first internodes increase in length, then
decrease, and once more increase, until near the end of the shoot is another decrease
in the internodes.” The probable explanation of this case will be given in the
sequel. Finally, what may be regarded as the view commonly held may be gleaned from a
quotation from the new edition of Prrrrer’s ‘Physiology of Plants’ (6): “The
leaves and internodes on every shoot increase in size from below upwards. . . . . "i

Stress must be laid on the fact that, when the statements given above are true,
they concern solely the shoot produced during one vegetative season.
