lead to an algebraic system for the constant velocity (u2, v2) and density p2 of state (2), which has
solutions for some but not all of the wedge angles. Specifically, for fixed densities po < p; of states


(0) and (1), there exist a sonic angle 6%, and a detachment angle od satisfying

such that state (2) exists for all Ow € (os, x /2) and does not exist for Aw € (0, ody, and the weak state
(2) is supersonic at the reflection point Po(Ow) for Ow € (6%,, 77/2), sonic for Ow = 6;,, and subsonic

In fact, for each Oy € (08, 2/2), there exists also a strong state (2) with pyre > peak, There
had been a long debate to determine which one is physical for the local theory; see [14,15,25]
and references therein. It is expected that the strong reflection-diffraction configuration is non-
physical; indeed, it is shown in Chen & Feldman [26] that the weak reflection—diffraction
configuration tends to the unique normal reflection, but the strong reflection—diffraction

configuration does not, when the wedge angle 6 tends to 7/2. The corresponding reflection— : =
diffraction shock in the weak reflection—diffraction configuration is called a weak shock, since its : =
strength is relatively weak in comparison with the other shock given by the strong state (2). From : 5
now on, state (2) always refers to the weak state (2). [=

If state (2) is supersonic, the propagation speeds of the solution are finite, and state (2) is : <
