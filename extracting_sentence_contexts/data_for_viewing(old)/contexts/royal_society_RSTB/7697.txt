a traverse across the mass. Forward movement in line with the mass, originating early in
the launching process as a pursuit of neighbours, evolves into a preoccupation with simply
keeping up with neighbours on either side in the fully migrating band or swarm. Compen-
satory responses of this type perpetuate parallel movement and generate gregarious
inertia.

The continuing occurrence of active gregarious responses during the process of swarm
migration shows itself in the abruptness of ‘gregarious reversal’ in wind (p. 194). This term
was applied to the remarkably well-synchronized change of course by members of dense
swarms, from up-wind to down-wind in gusts and back to up-wind in lulls. Its effect
seemed to be to impose ‘due down-wind courses on locusts which, when less dense, merely
turned from up-wind to some across-wind course when hit by a gust. Gregarious reversal
seemed to depend on the fact that locusts losing headway or turning aside from their up-
wind course began at once to drop backwards relative to their fellows still making headway
into wind, thus stimulating the latter to turn down-wind after them until all were flying in
parallel down-wind.

The differences between the tracks of neighbouring fliers, which are here assumed to be
the starting point for gregarious reversal in gusts, could come about in at least two ways.
First, it may be assumed that individuals differ in respect of the timing and strength of the
responses governing their air speed and course. Secondly, the tracks of individuals will
differ also because the wind itself is not a smooth current, least of all during the onset of
a gust. This is apparent from the findings of Giblett (1932), who has been quoted already in
part (p. 207) to show that the large differences of velocity found in wind were unlikely to
affect orientation. Within these large ‘eddies’, however, there are much smaller eddies
