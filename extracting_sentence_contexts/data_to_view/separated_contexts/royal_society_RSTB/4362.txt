Ramenta.â€”The characteristic Bennettitalean multicellular ramenta have been so
fully described for other species and so well figured by WreLanp (1906) that there
is no need to particularise them in the present species. They are, however, rather
exceptionally numerous, as can be judged by the large areas occupied by masses of
them in the transverse section of the main trunk, where they occupy a greater area
than the leaf-bases they surround (see Plate 23, fig. 1). This is perhaps correlated with the fact that the cones are exceedingly young, and
the plant was thus. petrified in this undeveloped state, viz., at a time when the
protective scales must have been at the height of their usefulness, and consequently
proportionately bulky.
