Tf the dose though large is sublethal the respiration after remaining slow and
dyspneeal for 70 to 150 minutes begins to accelerate, this change being anterior to
the rise of temperature towards the normal. A second slowing of respiratory
rhythm—not however dyspneeal or extreme in character—is usually observed after the
temperature has almost reached its normal level. Of the three alkaloids examined
pseudaconitine is distinctly the most depressant towards respiration.


PHARMACOLOGY OF PSEUDACONITINE AND JAPACONITINE. 49

It may be noted here that repeated daily administrations of sublethal doses of
pseudaconitine ave followed by a somewhat lessened effect upon the respiration. It
is probably this fact which explains the degree of tolerance (trifling though it is)
which is established towards the alkaloid.

Temperature.—The preliminary rise of internal temperature (frequently, though
by no means invariably, seen in rabbits after aconitine) is even less usual after
pseudaconitine, and this fact seems to stand in relationship with the slighter tendency
to respiratory acceleration occasioned by the latter. The ensuing fall of temperature
bears a direct proportion to the dose of the alkaloid, when the conditions under which
the animal is maintained are similar. Thus a relatively smaller dose will cause a
greater and more enduring reduction when the animal is in a cool atmosphere, and
when the loss of heat from the surface is not guarded against, than under the reverse
conditions. The maximal fall after large sublethal doses oceurs within 2) hours
of administration and amounts to 2 to 8°5 C. Return towards the normal succeeds
