In the case of the point of contact of a double tangent,
She of the tangents from the point coincides with the double tangent ; but the point B
S here the other point of contact of this tangent, s0 that the points 4, B are not coin-
Faent. In the case of a double point, regarding the assumed position of & at the double
Foint as belonging to one of the two branches, then of the X—2 tangents there are two,
Zach coinciding with the tangent to the other branch ; hence, attending to either of
THhese, the point B belongs to the other branch, and thus, though @ and B are each of
Ehem at the double point, the two do not constitute a united point. (In illustration
emark that for a unicursal curve, the position of @ answers to a value =, and that of
to a value =þ of the parameter 0, viz. a, w are the two values of 0 at the double
point; contrariwise in the foregoing case of a cusp, where there is a single value A={p. Hence the whole number of the united points («, B) is =:;+z, and this is in fact the
value given (as will presently appear) by the theory of correspondence. I recall that I use A, =2D, to denote twice the deficiency of the curve, viz. that we
have A=X —22+2+z, =—24—2X+2+E.
