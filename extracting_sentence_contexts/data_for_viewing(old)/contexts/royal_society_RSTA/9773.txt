Consider the focal circle and the comatic circle simultaneously ; we may take

1 cos +m cos 24, —lsin #+m sin 2¢,

1 = $d6°6,H, m = $d'Bd,G ;

where

this is a trochoidal curve, which becomes a three cusped hypocycloid for / = 2m and
goes through the types illustrated below for different values of B/d. For a given
value of 8 all these types are present for different values of d, and are described
about different centres owing to the comatic increase of focal length. These facts are
well known in particular instances, and even experimentally, but as far as I can find
they have not hitherto been expressly demonstrated generally.

The plane at which these phenomena are found is taken at x’ = gf’, where

af'[f! = —Kaf’ = 4d%,G +48" (3,G-+8,H).

The part depending upon d’ represents the spherical aberration; the part
depending upon #”, if it were present alone, would indicate that the images, if we
