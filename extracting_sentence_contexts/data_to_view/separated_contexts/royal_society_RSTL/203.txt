But at the same time, and more immedi-
ately, it is a real manometer, since the immediate action ex-
ercised on its column, and to! which this is also proportional,
is, ceteris paribus, exercised by the density of the fluid; or
fluids, which surround it, whose action is exactly the same as
if any part of the mass of those fluids were suddenly secluded
from the rest in a close vessel. Therefore, when steam is
mixed with air, be. the mass shut up! in a vessel, or be it a
certain part of the atmosphere distinet by its place, both fluids
will act on the column of the manometer or. barometer, or on
every obstacle, and thus against each other, according; to their
respective power ;. for this fundamental reason, proceeding
from the nature of steam as now. explained, « That no me-
« chanical cause can produce the decomposition of that fluid,
« but by forcing its particles to come nearer each other than
* theactual temperature can permit:” whichcase cannot happen
in the atmosphere, except by the accumulation of steam itself
in some part of it ; since, elsewhere, it only remains mixed

with the air according to its own laws, as if there were no
air. The whole theory of hygrology, as far as I have been able
to collect the. phaxnomena of that class, appears to me com-
prehended in; the foregoing propositions, founded on facts. The objects. of | that science are in general the: cause of eva-
poration, and the modifications of the evaporated water. The
common source of the water thus disseminated in the atmo-
sphere, is the surface of the earth ; whence, in spontaneous
evaporation, both in air and i vacuo, as well as in ebullition,
we ee that, water fly off with latent fire.
