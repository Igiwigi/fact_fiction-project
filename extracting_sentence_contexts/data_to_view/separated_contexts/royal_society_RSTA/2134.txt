It turns out that the spectral bounds for Ramanujan graphs reappear in
these settings. Theorem 6.2 ([36,37]).

(1) If S C PU(2) is a symmetric set of size k, then 4g => 2Vk — 1.
(2) For prime p=1 (mod 4), there is an explicit symmetric set Sp C PU(2) of size k=p+1 such
that 4s, =2Vk—1. In fact, the connection to Ramanujan graphs runs deeper than the spectral bound. The
construction of Sp, and of the (p + 1)-regular Ramanujan graphs in [1], can be described using
a single subgroup of PU(Q), which acts simply-transitively on the Bruhat-Tits tree of PU2(Q,) =
PGL2(Qy,) (this isomorphism follows from p = 1 (mod 4)). This also solves the compiling problem:
by writing any A € (S)) in p-adic coordinates, one recovers its decomposition in (S,) by following
the (unique) path leading from A to the root of the tree (cf. [20]).
