When the medium is perfectly transparent the square of the refractive inde
assumes the form 1 4+ A/(8 — p?), which agrees with a formula given by von Hm
HoLTz and generally recognized to be a good representation of the dispersive proper
ties of ordinary media; as that author has remarked, it may be helped out of
outstanding discrepancy by assuming slight non-selective opacity due to ordinat
conduction, such as would not sensibly affect FRrEsnet’s laws of reflexion. In th
theory there is only one absorption band in the ultra violet, corresponding to p =}

pective of special theory, be a rational function of p?, and therefore when
vessed in partial fractions must assume the form 1 -++ ¥A,/(B, — p’); while in
case of opaque media the constants typified by A will be complex, and other
rtial fractions not corresponding to absorption bands will also enter.
_ In the case of opaque media, a peculiarity of this analysis, as compared with that
of yon Hetmuorrz* and others, is that the conduction current is derived from the
electric displacement by the inverse operator k (md/dt + o’)~! instead of a direct
rator involving a coefficient of conductivity in place of the coefticient of resist-
ance o’. Notwithstanding that there are as many as four adjustable constants, it is
= to some extent, to crucially compare the resulting formula for K’ with the
‘experimental facts for metallic media. It is known that the broad type of formal
Btheory which simply assigns to the metals a complex index of refraction K" is con-
firmed by the general agreement between results deduced trom calculations relating
Bio reflexion experiments by Brrr, Vorar, Drupe and others, and those obtained
aetly from deviation experiments with thin metallic prisms by Kunpv.t It turns
