I have not sought to yerify this theorem by my formulee. IT remark, that com-
bining it with the before-mentioned theorem, the five-pointic conic is completely deter-
mined as follows ; viz.—

Theorem.—The five-pointic conic touches the conic at the point of contact (two con-
ditions); it passes through the two points in which the polar conic is intersected by the
tangent to the cubic at the tangential of the point of contact (two conditions); and it

s through the point which is the third point of intersection with the cubic of the
Qline joining the point of contact with its second tangential.
42. The construction for the point of simple intersection leads at once to that for the
Zextactic points; in fact, consider a point having for its tangential a point of inflexion :
A point of inflexion is its own tangential, and the second tangential of the first-men-
Jioned point is therefore the point of inflexion : the line joining the point with the
Second tangent is therefore the tangent at the point, and the point of simple intersec-
Jion coincides with the point itself, that is, the point in question is a sextactic point. E 43. I represent the equation of the five-pointic conic by

Ahe value of @ is

An which equation ?

£ Q=pP# +22 +ofy*— 3Pa%y*2? ;

Si reducing by the equation 2*+y*+2*+ 6lzyz=0,
&Z =p +a*(—a*—6tlayz)— 3Pa*y*2?,
That is,
