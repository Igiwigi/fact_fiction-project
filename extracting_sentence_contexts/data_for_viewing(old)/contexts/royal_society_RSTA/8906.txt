or, if we fit so as to make the straight line pass through the origin (treating the 9-09
Angs./mm. as negligible),
r = (0-7205)8,

which again gives a value of 8 in fair agreement with the loading curve, and also with
the previously found values of 8 for this specimen.

Tt would appear, therefore, that the law r = aT'-+-AS is a fairly good fit, the behaviour
of O,,; being anomalous.* This accounts for the remarkable similarity which
undoubtedly exists between the curves of extension to time and those of optical
retardation to time, under constant load. In the earlier experiments in which these two
were observed separately, this similarity was often partly masked by the influence of
previous treatment on the specimens, and by the fact that the same specimen could
not be employed for both sets of observations without reshaping.

§ 12. Comparison with the Results of Coker and CuaKko,

Meanwhile it is of considerable interest to examine the results of Coker and CuakKo
(loc. cit.). Table I., on p. 149 of their memoir, gives a set of corresponding values of
strain, stress, and optical retardation; the latter, however, being expressed as an
“ Equivalent Stress ” deduced from the simple stress-optical law, so that their units are
not comparable with those used in this paper. Using, however, Coker and CuaKko’s
units, we find, in their notation

So = 94°54+0°426296f4154642e . 2 2 2... (28)
