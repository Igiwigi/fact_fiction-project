and gig’: Yu Zy Yw [Lor Z onall other qubits].

Notice that in both cases the AVN argument is reduced to just three qubits. Moreover, by the
discussion at the end of the previous subsection, we know that the state corresponding to the
subgraph induced by u, v, w in either of these two cases is LC-equivalent to a tripartite GHZ state:
incase 1, we have a complete graph on three vertices, while in case 2, we have a star graph centred
atu. a

The second part of the above result means that the essence of the contradiction is witnessed
by looking at only three qubits. In fact, in the contexts being considered, the experimenters at the
remaining n — 3 parties perform either no measurement or a Z measurement. We could imagine
that, in trying to build a consistent global assignment of outcomes in Zz to all the measurements,
each of these n — 3 parties i is allowed to freely choose a value 0 or 1 for the variable Z;. Then, the
equations for the variables representing the measurements of the remaining three parties would
be those of the usual GHZ argument, up to flipping an even number of the values on the right-
hand side. In terms of the state, we can use the ‘partial inner product’ operation described, for
example, in [35, p. 129] to apply the eigenvectors corresponding to the chosen values for the
other 1 — 3 parties to |G), resulting in a three-qubit pure state that is LC-equivalent to the GHZ
state.

From this theorem, we immediately obtain the following corollaries:
