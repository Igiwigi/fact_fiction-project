For the sCIENCE-RELATED
microscopes and test tubes are very closely associated, relative trial (figure 2a), this resulted in a relatively high COM score
to the microscope and other items. This is because microscopes of 4.24.

and test tubes are frequently found together in a common
(science-related) setting. The fact that they are so commonly

found together means that the trial requires less abstraction (0) Trial concreteness as a general, context-relative

than one where the target and match are neither visually simi- measure of abstractness
lar nor commonly found together. In what sense does it To demonstrate that VIS and COM—two context-sensitive
involve less abstraction? In this case, the sort of abstraction measures of abstractness—better predict participant perfor-
required is not abstraction away from the perceptible features mance than canonical concreteness ratings, we performed
of the target and match, but away from regularities in past per- a two-step linear regression model predicting participant
ceptual episodes.
