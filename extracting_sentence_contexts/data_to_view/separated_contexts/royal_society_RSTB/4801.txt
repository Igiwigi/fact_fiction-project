In other respects the series of correlations is
not out of harmony with several of the Broadbalk plots, the characteristic period of
winter damage is clearly recognisable in both, and we may identify the positive corre-
lations obtained in late Spring with the minimum of damage observed on several of
our plots at the same season. The July values also are suggestive of the more highly
nitrogenous plots on Broadbalk. The fact that Hooxnr’s series appears to incline on
the whole to more positive values than are observed in our regressions is not improbably
due to the inclusion in his data of yields from lighter lands, more susceptible to summer
droughts than is the heavy loam of Broadbalk ; in addition his mean rainfall is some
four inches less than in out series. The earlier half of the series, in which the Broadbalk plots are most alike, is alone in
contradiction to Hookerr’s series. Of course, if strong meteorological correlations
existed between the several parts of the year, no resemblance need be expected between

the actual regressions and the correlations which are, in a complicated manner, com-
pounded from them ; and even slight meteorological correlations might seriously disturb
the numerical values of the correlations with the crop; but our meteorological data
show that such correlations between weather at different periods of the year, though
probably present, are quite small; and since the agreement, in its general qualitative
outline, has not been disturbed from January onwards, it is probable that other factors
contribute to the striking difference observable in the effects of October rain.
