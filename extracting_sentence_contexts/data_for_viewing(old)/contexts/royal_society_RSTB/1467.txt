Curarised Muscle—Curari modifies the action of these aldoximes exactly in the
same way as it was found to modify the action of ethylaldoxime. All contracture is
abolished. This fact is illustrated by figs. 34 and 35. Both muscles were first
curarised, and then the one was immersed in a 1 per cent. solution of propylaldoxime,
and the other in a ‘5 per cent. solution of isobutylaldoxime. There is no evidence of
contracture. Throughout both tracings there is a gradual fall of the base line, just

as is seen in a muscle simply immersed in normal salt solution.
