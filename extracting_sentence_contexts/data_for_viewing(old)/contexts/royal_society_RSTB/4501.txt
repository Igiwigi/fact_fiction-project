are inactivated in some way not understood. The experiments do not prove that
the pigment in the sclerotia of the parental strain is due to the oxidation of a
chromogen or that the aberrant strain has arisen by the loss or inactivation of a factor
for chromogen. When, however, the above results are considered along with those
of GortNERr (32), KEEBLE and ARMsTRONG (41, 42, 43) and others, which cumulatively
form such positive circumstantial evidence, it is somewhat difficult to resist drawing
the deduction that the albino strain of Botrytis cinerea has indeed arisen from the
black parental form by the loss or modification of a factor for chromogen.

7. SIGNIFICANCE OF CoLOURLEsS Form.

A. Discussion of Recorded Mutations.
The essential facts in the preceding pages may be summarised as follows: The

colourless form arose spontaneously without any evident relation to external con-
ditions or stimuli, in a single sclerotium of a culture which on accepted criteria was a
pure line. The new form is apparently differentiated from its parent in respect to a
single character only, that of colour, and this albinism would appear to be associated
with the absence of a factor for chromogen. .The change has occurred once only,
and has given rise to a form unknown in nature and perfectly constant under all
conditions. It would seem possible to place only one interpretation on these facts,
that of mutation, and accordingly when I was privileged to exhibit this form to the
Linnean Society of London on April 8, 1919, I described it as “an albino mutant of
Botrytis cinerea.”
