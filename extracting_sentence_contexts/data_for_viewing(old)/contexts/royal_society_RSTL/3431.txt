and there abruptly terminates, the line of union being definitely notable. 2nd. The
extremity of the fasciculus being with certainty apparent, has precisely the same ap-
pearance as its other parts, presenting a perfect terminal disc, and the sarcolemma
attached to its border. The corpuscles also adyance as far as the extremity.

On the Mechanism of the Movement of Voluntary Muscle.

Nothing certain is yet known concerning the more minute changes which the pri-
mitive fasciculi undergo during a state of contraction. 'The theory of Prevosr and
Dumas, though till finding a place in the best physiological works, seems to be falling
every day into more general discredit. Many who have endeavoured to inspect the
phenomenon on which it was based, have failed in convincing themselves that it is
the true condition of contraction ; and others, though noticing the fact of the zigzag
flexure of the fasciculi, have not confirmed the account given of the correspondence
of the angles to the transit of nerves. Professor Owex has been led to doubt it *from
observing the contraction of the muscular fibres in small filarize (snch as commonly
infest the abdominal cavity of the Cod), and more especially from observing the con-
traction of the retractor muscles of a species of Vesicularia, © Each separate fibre
of the retractor muscle,” he says, © is seen with great distinctness, and is characterized
by a single knot or swelling in the middle. In the act of retracting the tentacles, the
fibres become $horter and thicker, especially at the central knot, but do not fall out
of the straight line*.” I am ignorant whether these be fasciculi having transverse
strizz. If not, the bearing of the observation on the contraction of striated muscle is
less direct and important. The same acute observer afterwards explains, that the
zigzag folding of the fibres is characteristic of their state of relaxation, when not
