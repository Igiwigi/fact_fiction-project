The results of this experiment, and of several others similar
to it, showed, in a manner which appeared to me to be perfectly
conclusive, that those substances which part with heat with the
greatest facility, or celerity, are those which also acquire it most
readily, or with the greatest celerity.


and the Mode of its Communication. 129

If we might suppose that the temperatures of bodies are
changed, not by the rays they emit, but by those they receive
from other neighbouring bodies, this fact might easily be ex-
plained; but, without stopping to form any hypothesis for the
explanation of these appearances, I shall proceed in my account
of the various attempts I have made to elucidate, by new expe-
riments, those parts of this interesting subject which still ap-
peared to be enveloped in obscurity. As the cooling of hot bodies is 80 much accelerated by covering
their surfaces with such substances as emit calorific rays in great
abundance, or with such as are much affected by the ſrigorific
rays of the colder bodies by which they are surrounded, it seems
tobe highly probable, that a comparatively small part of the
heat, which a body s0 cooled actually loses, is acquired by the
air; a much greater proportion of it passing off through that
transparent fluid, under the form of calorific rays, without af-
fecting its temperature. If this supposition should turn out to be well founded, the
knowledge of the fact would enable us to explain several inte-
resting phenomena, and particularly that most curious process
by means of which living animals preserve an equal temperature,
notwithstanding the vast quantities of heat that are continually
generated in the lungs, and notwithstanding the great variations
which take place in the temperature of-the air in which they
live. It is evident, that the greater the power .is which an animal
possesses of throwing off heat from-the surface of his body, inde-
pendently of that which the surrounding air takes off, the less
will his temperature be affected bythe occasional changes of
