Xâ€”Buppinc In THE STYELIDAE, including Botryllidae, Fig. 17

The Styelidae and also the non-budding orders Pyuridae and Molgulidae of the
order Stolidobranchiata are widely separated on morphological grounds from the
families so far discussed. As in the Perophoridae, the gut loop has been reflected
anteriorly and lies along the left side of the branchial sac. But additional
morphological differences separate these families even from the Perophoridae.
The epicardium has become the renal vesicle and the mesenchyme septum of the
test blood vessels has been lost. The large ventral stolonic vessel, in fact, no longer
exists. So that any process of budding among these families that there may be is by
the nature of the individual precluded from involving a post-abdomen, epicardial
epithelium or vascular septum. Budding, in fact, in the only family with that faculty
in the Stolidobranchiata is without doubt a re-acquirement and is markedly different
from any of those methods so far described. At the same time among the Styelidae
and the subfamily Botryllidae the mode of budding is uniform and yet so different
from other types that the conclusion is unavoidable that the re-acquisition has
occurred but once only.

The differences within the family are slight and concern for the most part rate
of budding, length of stolons, etc., which while virtually without significance do
have a very marked influence on the appearance of the colony as a whole and on
the size of its constituent zooids.

Of the species examined Polyandrocarpa tincta forms colonies of four or five zooids
