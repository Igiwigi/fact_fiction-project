Instead of the spectrum becoming more complex it became simpler, exhibiting in fact
only the four longest lines of barium with any degree of distinctness, and these showing
but little brilliancy.

STRONTIUM and MAGNESIUM.

Strontium behaved in this particular in the same way as barium did, the falling off of
the lines in the fluoride being very marked. In the case of magnesium (which, as regards
its chloride, bromide, and iodide, followed the behaviour of the alkali metals, to which I
shall immediately refer, rather than that of barium and strontium), the fluoride exhi-
bited the same stubborn resistance to the action of the spark. It is to be remarked that
these three fluorides are non-volatile, and s0 infusible that even after long exposure to
the current there was little or no indication of coherence ; in fact, in the case of mag-
nesic fluoride, the salt was distinctly seen to be blown out of the cup as a cloud of dust,
and when one of these particles was converted into vapour in the spark, the spectrum
exhibited fragments of lines sharp at both ends.

On blowing a cloud of magnesic fluoride in fine powder through the spark, 6 in
particular was seen as a series of three pointed lines.

It will be seen from the above experiments, and from the annexed map of the strontium
8alts observed in air (Plate LI.) taken as a type of this group, that the general statement
made for lead does not apply to barium or strontium, the chlorides, bromides, and iodides
of which metals are pretty equally volatile, while their fluorides are apparently not readily
volatile at any temperature which I could employ.
