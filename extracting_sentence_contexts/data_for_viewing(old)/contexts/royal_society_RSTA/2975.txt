with compliance since 2013; the second compliance period started in 2015, and lasted until 2017,
including suppliers of transportation fuels, natural gas and other fuels; and 2018-2020 covers the
third period. In line with global tendencies of carbon pricing, the cap-and-trade programme of
California was recently extended until 2030 [61], along with similar intentions from the linked
markets of Québec and Ontario [62]. The California-Québec-Ontario cap-and-trade programme
now forms the third largest carbon market in the world following China and the European Union.

California is one of the largest economies in the world. The state has a consumption of 7676
trillion BTU (2015), producing internally around 2353 trillion BTU of primary energy (crude oil
and natural gas account for 49% and 11%, nuclear electric power 8% and renewables 31%).*
California’s electricity system generates more than 290 TWh per year. The installed capacity
shares in 2016 included approximately 54% natural gas, 18% hydroelectric, 25% other renewables
and 3% nuclear. In fact, California produces 70% of the electricity it uses. The remaining amount
is imported.5

The California challenge on electricity under AB32 is to secure supply with 33% of renewable
sources, while reducing GHG emissions. California has an emission goal of 427 MMT COze
(million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent) in 2020, ie. equalling 1990 estimated emissions, and
aims for an 80% reduction in 2050 below 1990 levels. In 2015, California emitted a total of 440
MMT CO3ze, from which 39% originates in transportation, 23% from industrial sources and 19%
from electricity generation (8% imported plus 11% in state).°
