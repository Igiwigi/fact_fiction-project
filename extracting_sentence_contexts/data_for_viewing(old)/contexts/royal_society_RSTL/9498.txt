(6.) Section IT. (Part I.) contains a description of the experiments undertaken to
verify the revelations of Section X. respecting thermal transpiration ; which experi-
ments establish not only the existence of the phenomena, but also an exact correspon-
dence between the rexults for different plates at corresponding densities of the gas.

(7.) Section III. contains a description of the experiments on transpiration under
pres84re, undertaken to verify the revelations of Section X. with respect to the
correspondence between the results to be-obtained with plates of different coarseness
ab certain corresponding densities of the gas; which experiments proved, not only
the existence of this correspondence, but also that the ratio of the corresponding den-
sities in these experiments are the same as the ratio of the corresponding densities
with the same plates for thermal transpirationâ€”a fact which proves that the ratio
depends on the relative coarseness of the plates.

(8.) Section IV. contains a description of the experiments with the fibre of silk and
with the spider-line, undertaken to verify the revelations of Section XIT. ; from which
experiments it appears that, with these small surfaces, phenomena, of impulsion similar
to those of the radiometer occur at pressures but little less than that of the atmo-
sphere.

126. As regards transpiration and impulsion, the investigation appears to be com-
plete. Most, if not all, the phenomena previously known have been shown to be such
as mus result from the tangential and normal stresses consequent on a varying
condition of molecularly constituted gas ; while the previously unsuspected phenomena,
