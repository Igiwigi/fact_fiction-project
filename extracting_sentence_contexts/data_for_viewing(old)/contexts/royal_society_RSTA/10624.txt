This shows us that ¢,, decreases with s,, or that 1, decreases with s,, that is to say,
the more intense the selection the less is the correlation. This in broad terms
demonstrates the general principle that intensity of selection connotes a lessening of
correlation. It is this principle which very possibly accounts for the fact that the
more civilized races of man appear to be not only more variable but more highly
correlated than the less civilized, among whom the struggle for existence is more
intense. It may, perhaps, also account for the skeletons of women of the civilized
races having their parts more highly correlated than the parts of those of men.*
Lastly, it may well throw some light on the markedly plastic character of races
which have been stringently selected with regard to one or a few organs only.

As an illustration, suppose that the correlation between femur and tibia were ‘7,
and let us investigate what would be the effect of reducing the variability of the tibia
by direct selection 50 per cent. We find at once on substituting s/o, = °5 and
yy = ‘7 in (li.) above that ty = “44, or a reduction of about 37 per cent, This will,
perhaps, be sufficient to indicate what immense changes must be made in the
