and the horizontal velocities for any stratum will be connected with the corresponding
function by the equations (34). The equation of continuity for any stratum may be
formed as in § 3, provided we replace h by the depth of the stratum in question
instead of the depth of the whole ocean. The stream-lines for any stratum will
therefore still be given by the equation (38), with this modification in the meaning
of the symbol h. It follows that the equator will still be one of the free stream-
lines, but the motion elsewhere may be totally different from what it would be if the
density were the same throughout. It seems probable then that’ the result we have
obtained with reference to the tendency of the currents to set along the equator will
still hold good even when the density is variable, and this conclusion is borne out by

* The principal facts at present known in relation to the distribution of temperature in the ocean

observation, it being noticeable at a glance at the Admiralty current charts that
there is no tendency to cross the equator except in the immediate neighbourhood of
the coasts.

The rigorous treatment of the problem of ocean currents, as affected by variations
in the density of the water, appears to be hopelessly beyond the powers of mathe-
matical analysis, and I will therefore leave the subject with the brief indications
