mobility or traits we would now recognize to be under pre-mating sexual
selection [5]. Especially with the evolution of internal fertilization, however, a
further male trait that can come to play a potentially decisive role for male
reproductive success is the complex mixture of proteins, peptides and other
ejaculate substances known collectively as seminal fluid [6-8].

The widespread importance of seminal fluid to paternity outcomes is
hardly surprising, and indeed was recognized from the outset [1]. Ejaculate sub-
stances are singularly well-positioned to influence both the post-ejaculation
performance of own (and rival) sperm as well as the reproductive behaviour
and physiology of mating partners, and the ways they might do so are many
and varied. This therefore creates multiple potential routes for seminal fluid
action. In fact, many features of seminal fluid—such as its complexity, multi-
functionality, redundancy and species-specificity—are probably best understood
as accumulated signatures of historical selection for novel seminal fluid functions
