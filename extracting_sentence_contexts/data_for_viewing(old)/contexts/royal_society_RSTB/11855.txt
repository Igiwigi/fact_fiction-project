behaviours requires generating a wide range of output
types. In the current MuMMER prototype, a hybrid
chatbot/task-based system is used for interaction manage-
ment [49]—however, even in that context, the actual textual
output is ultimately produced by templates, where infor-
mation such as a particular movie or current news item is
filled into a linguistic structure such as ‘My favourite is X’
or ‘Have you heard about Y ’.

It must be noted that templates are not always an invalid
implementation decision for language generation [16]—
indeed, skilfully written templates can provide a high
degree of flexibility and expressiveness. In fact, the field
of social robotics can draw some benefit from incorporating
‘traditional’ NLG techniques such as rule-based or

grammar-based processing. Moving beyond the current sol-
utions which mainly involve canned text or very simple
templates is still likely to permit more socially intelligent
interactions, particularly if the robot is deployed in new con-
texts or must interact in a different language. For example,
open-source text realizers such as SimpleNLG [50] or
OpenCCG [51] could be used to provide advantages such
as flexibility and cross-lingual support.
