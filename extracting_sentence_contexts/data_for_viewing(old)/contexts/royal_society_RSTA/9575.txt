226 PROF, A. FOWLER ON SERIES LINES IN SPARK SPECTRA.

$1. Introductory.

" ‘Tum classical work of RypperG, and that of Kayser and Runaer, dealt mainly with
series lines in spectra which are developed in the flame or electric are, or in vacuum
tubes with discharges of moderate intensity. The lines to be discussed in the present
communication are some of those which belong to the class of enhanced lines as defined
by Lockyer ; that is, they are relatively intensified in passing from are to spark
conditions.

In considering these lines it is necessary to take account of the fact that their
behaviour in the are is different for different elements. At least three classes may be
recognised :—(I.) Enhanced lines like the H and K lines of calcium, which are well
developed in the ordinary are ; (II.) Lines which only appear with small intensities in
the are, such as the enhanced lines of iron; (III.) Lines which do not appear in the
ordinary are (except very locally near the poles), but are strongly developed under
spark conditions, as in the case of the well-known magnesium line at \ 4481.

Until very recently the only evidence that enhanced lines may belong to series was
that afforded by RuncEe and PascHen’s observations of the spectra of magnesium,
calcium, strontium, barium, and radium, under the influence of a magnetic field. In
the case of each of these elements, three pairs of lines of Class I. were observed, and
though no series formule could be calculated for them, the magnetic resolutions
