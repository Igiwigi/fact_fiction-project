586, Tre present paper is a continuation of the Bakerian Lecture *On the Nlamina-
tion of Lines of Molecular Pregsure and the Trajectory of Molecules,‚Äù read before the
Royal Society, December 5, 1878. Phenomena there briefly referred to have since been
more fully examined ; new facts have been observed, and their theoretical bearings
discussed ; and numerous experiments 8uggested by Professor SToKEs and others have
been tried, with the regult of acquiring much information which cannot fail to be of
value in assisting to evolve a theory capable of embracing all the phenomena under
discussion.

587. In par. 514 I deseribed a piece of apparatus by means of which the molecular
rays electrically projected from the negative pole at a high exhaustion were converged
to a focus, the pole itself being hemi-cylindrical in shape. On referring to the coloured
drawing illustrating the experiments it will be observed that the green phospho-
rescence of the glass (by means of which the presence of the molecular rays is mani-
fested) does not take place close to the negative pole. Tt has been since found that
