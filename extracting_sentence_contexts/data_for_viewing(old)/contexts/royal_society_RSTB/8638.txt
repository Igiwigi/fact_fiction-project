Figure 1. Representation of place cell sequences by temporal correlation at two timescales. (a) Encoding of sequential locations by individual place cells. Arrows
mark Euclidian distance between two colour-coded locations, magenta and cyan. (b) Temporal correlation of the two cells marked in (a) assessed at two timescales
by the temporal bias on the cross-correlogram (CCG) and measured by the red (compressed timescale) and black (real-time timescale) arrows. Asterisks mark the first

timescales during run. Reproduced from Dragoi & Buzsaki [15] with permission from Cell Press.
