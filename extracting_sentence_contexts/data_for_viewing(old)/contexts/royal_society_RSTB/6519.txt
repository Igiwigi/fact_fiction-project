of 304—the size of the original cells of the Axp.-line which we may estimate from the
slope of the curve—must therefore reproduce for a period of 7 months under very
favourable conditions before the cells obtain an average diameter of 94. Then a period
of 3 months follows when, as in Ditylum, environmental factors may induce some cells
to form auxospores. That the main factor again changes in the medium produced
by the rich growth of a culture may be concluded from the fact that whenever a new
subculture was made a period of reproduction by division followed varying from
12-28 days in relatively broad cells to 1-2 days in narrow cells approaching a size at
which division: stopped and the cells died.

By transferring samples at frequent intervals (4—7 days) in fresh culture fluid it was
possible to eliminate the formation of auxospores in two lines for a period of 6 and
8 weeks respectively. The smaller the diameter of the cells the more difficult it becomes
to eliminate auxospore formation.
