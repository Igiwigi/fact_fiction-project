An important question opened by our analysis is why the biological network exhibits distinct
features for TE and shows patterns in AI associated with functional regulation, when global
measures yield no distinction between the biological network and random networks. We suggest
that the separate analysis of two distinct levels of informational patterns (e.g. node-node or state-
state) as presented above misses what arguably may be one of the most important features of
biological organizationâ€”that is, that distinct levels interact. This view is supported by the fact
that the control kernel plays a prominent role in the distinctive local informational patterns of :
the fission yeast cell-cycle network, but was in fact first identified for its role regulating dynamics :3
on the global attractor landscape. The control kernel may therefore be interpreted as mediating :s
the connection between the local and global causal structure of the network. The results of the previous :
section indicate that these same nodes act as a hub for the transfer of information within the
network and for information storage.
