19980 a possible D line with limit (—é,)D() instead of a possible one with
(—8) D(~).

The preceding treatment of the material is only a first step towards unravelling the
intricacies of these D systems. An exhaustive treatment is here impossible, and
would involve the consideration of other data—the triplet separations, linkages,
similarities of arrangement, dependence on F series and so on. All that can be done
is to give a few illustrative instances and to bring into prominence certain problems
whose solution in the future may be of extreme importance.

(1) The line 20021 is given as requiring the displacement —30, in the limit, and in
this case the mantissa is 80A,. This displacement increases the limit 51025 by 31°88,
and the resulting », should be greater by 3x 535 = 1°60 and = 1779°50. Asa fact the
line (see p. 382) forms a doublet with separation 1779°51, and with intensities 1, 10, in
the proper order for a D,, set. All the tests support each other. Again in the
doublets }

(7) 2050013 178468 = (2) 22284°82
(8) 20559°08 1785°64 (<1n) 22344'72

the same displacements (or of +33,) are indicated. If we suppose these modified
values of », produced in the same way as in Kr by a relative displacement in the
sequent, the oun in this case alters the separation by 4°91. The modified », therefore
becomes 1779°50+4°91 = 1784°41, or within error limits of the observed value for
20500, but too small for 20559. That for 20559 corresponds to an extra displacement
