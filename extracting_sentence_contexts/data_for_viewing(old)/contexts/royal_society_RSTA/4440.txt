and generates electron-hole pairs. The electrons are injected to ZnO and eventually reach Pt
and reduce H* to Hp. The holes located in the VB of CdS are used by the sacrificial agents
(figure 7). The presence of Pt in these structures shows approximately sevenfold improvement in
H2 evolution activity. The presence of Pt on ZnO is twofold more highly active compared with Pt
present on CdS, indicating the importance of location of Pt. In this configuration of ZnO/Pt/CdS,
vectrorial transfer of excited electrons makes them suitable for charge transfer and separation.
Partial substitution of Zn in CdS as in ZnO/Pt/Cd,_yZn,S has shown remarkable changes in the
activities (figure 82). ZnO/Pt/Cdo,gZno 2S heterostructures have exhibited a maximum hydrogen
evolution of 12.5 and 31.2mmolh7! gt in the presence of NayS—Na7SO3 under visible and UV-
visible irradiation, respectively. Although the substitution of Zn in CdS increases the band gap
making fewer photons suitable for absorption, we see enhanced H2 evolution activity. This could
be due to the enhanced charge separation obtained by altering the band alignment by partial
substitution of Zn in CdS. This fact was also supported by room temperature photoluminescence
studies. Similar effect has also been observed with partial substitution of Se in CdS as in
ZnO/Pt/CdS;_xSey. On replacing NazS—Na2SO3 with benzyl! alcohol-acetic acid, ZnO/Pt/CdS
and ZnO/Pt/CdoZno25 exhibited nearly threefold improvement in activity yielding 31.6 and
