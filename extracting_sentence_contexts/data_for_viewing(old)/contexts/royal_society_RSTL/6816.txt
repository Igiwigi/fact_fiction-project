G(m')=2e[m}+m+M(3[mP—2m+33)+M.4.
The NG formule, Article 35.

35. The NG formulz are now at once obtained, viz. we have
NG(m, n, p)=G(m?, n, p)+ G(m, 2?, p)+G(m, n, p*),
NG(r, nu) =3G(nf, n) +G(nw, mw),
NG(m?) =6G(m?),
which give the values in the Table.

The S formule, particular cases, Articles 36 to 40.

36. The $S formule have in fact been obtained in the investigation of the G formul:

we have
S(m, n, p)=2mnp,
S(m?, n) =n([m] +M),
Sm?) =I[mP+M(m—2).

37. In confirmation of the formula S(1, m?)=[mP+M, it is to be remarked that
we take through the line 1 an arbitrary plane, this meets the curve mz in m points, ar
Joining these two and two together we haye 4[m]? lines, each of them meeting the cur
m twice and also meeting the line 1; that is, the lines in question are generating lin«
of the scroll S(1, m?). The line 1 is, as already mentioned, an (h=)(4[m]*+M)tup!
line on the scroll; the section by the arbitrary plane is therefore the line 1 take
