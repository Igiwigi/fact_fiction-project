It is of interest to compare these formule with those obtained by making the Pearsonian
x? a minimum. For

so that on differentiating by dé, the condition that y* should be a minimum for variations

Equation (7) has actually been used (12) to “ improve” the values obtained by the
method of moments, even in cases of normal distribution, and the Porsson series, where
the method of moments gives a strictly sufficient solution. The discrepancy between
these two methods arises from the fact that x° is itself an approximation, applicable
only when 7, and n, are large, and the difference between them of a lower order of
magnitude. In such cases
L=8(n, log 2) = 8 (mre log ™*2) = Sixt = I cae gids
