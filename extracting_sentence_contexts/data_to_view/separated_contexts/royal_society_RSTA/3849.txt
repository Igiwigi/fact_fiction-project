The study showed
that searching for racial-related names commonly associated with Afro-American population mea)
in two major search engines generated ads suggestive of an arrest in up to 95% of cases. The :
discrimination occurring in this case rests on a form of profiling that does not breach individual a]
privacy. In fact, the names used in the study were not the names of real persons, yet it violates the DNS
right of individuals belonging to the group of the Afro-American population. This follows from [a
the very nature of data analytics and big data, whose goal is the identification of groups. [B

Nonetheless, even if the outcome does not breach individual privacy, it can still pose serious .
risks at the group level, showing that while privacy of individuals may not be breached, the one
of the group certainly is [29,30,60]. For this reason, the right to group privacy is increasingly more
often recognized as a crucial right to be defended in mature information societies.

[This] is a right held by a group as a group rather than by its members severally.
