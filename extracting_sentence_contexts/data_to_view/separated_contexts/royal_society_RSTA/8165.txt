The red-shortness which was to be anticipated in such material was confirmed by
the author, an attempt being made to forge a small piece from a corner of specimen
No. 68/F.2 but without success, that is, the material easily burst. Silver Steels.â€”It will be noted that the proportion of silver in such specimens as
contain this element never exceeds 0-46 per cent. This fact finds its explanation in the
very limited solubility of silver in steel, as well shown later in the microstructure of
specimen No. 12/C.1-1. Here the silver is found as a distinct micro-constituent. It will
thus be readily understood also why duplicate determinations of the silver content in
this specimen showed different amounts.
