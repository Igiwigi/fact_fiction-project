SOME MARINE PLANKTON DIATOMS 43

that during the spring and autumn outburst, as soon as these diatoms reached their
maximum number, resting spores occurred in the plankton.

On the whole the vegetative growth and reproduction during the spring outburst
takes place almost exclusively in the surface layer of 0-5 m. Towards the end of this
period, when the number of vegetative cells decreased in the uppermost layers, many
vegetative cells and resting spores occurred at 5 m. and finally many vegetative cells
and enormous numbers of resting spores—up to 14,000,000/100 1.—at 15 m. depth.

The facts that in the sea Chaetoceros cells start sinking when overcrowding of the
plankton sets in and that the main bulk of resting spores is formed at 5-15 m. depth,
i.e. in a layer of lower light intensity and possibly lower temperature, seem to support
the conclusions drawn from the experiments on cultures.

A perfect parallel to Loumann’s observations was recorded by Gran (1915). This
author found in the North Sea on a certain day in May that the diatoms were distri-
buted vertically throughout the whole of the water mass. The maximum production
had passed and a great number of resting spores of Chaetoceros debile and diadema were
found throughout the water column, but in particularly great quantities in the deep
water. There were of the first-named species at 0 m. 1580 vegetative cells and 12,400
resting spores per litre, at 68 m. depths 6500 and 195,100 respectively.
