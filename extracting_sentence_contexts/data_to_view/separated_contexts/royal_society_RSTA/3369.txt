standard for the electrical current [12]. In 1967, Little introduced the notion of phase slip due to TAPS [1] to describe the
finite resistance below Tc in thin wires made of superconductive material. At any non-zero
temperature, in fact, each segment of a thin wire has a finite probability to become a normal
conductor, for a very short time, due to phase-slip events. Each of these fluctuations could disrupt
the persistent current and confer a non-zero resistance to the wire. This resistance, defined by an
Arrhenius-type equation, drops exponentially with cooling but remains finite at any non-zero
temperature as an effect of TAPS events.
