theoretical argument demonstrated in an actual experiment which refutes any attempt to find
a classical statistical analogue of the weak value [70]. The argument is that the weak value is a
property of a single pre- and post-selected quantum system. Thus, it cannot have an analogy as
a statistical property of an ensemble.

Weak values were introduced as outcomes of weak measurements [1], which have large : 2
uncertainty in the pointer position. Thus, in experiments, the weak value is obtained as a =
statistical average of the pointer readings. Even among proponents of this concept, the weak value S
is frequently understood as a mere generalization of the expectation value for the case when the 73
quantum system is post-selected, i.e. a conditional expectation value [71,72]. : S

Contrary to the classical case, if we are given a single system in which a quantum variable has ih
a known definite eigenvalue, we cannot test this fact with certainty. We cannot distinguish with : 4
certainty between this situation and a case in which we started in a superposition which included 23
this eigenvalue. Still there is some certainty about this situation: we know that a measurement a
of this variable will yield the eigenvalue with certainty. This is what makes this situation not : 3

statistical. This is not the case if we are given a quantum system described by a known expectation
value of the variable. There is no single experiment with definite outcome specified by the
expectation value.

What we have found in [70] is that when the system is described by a weak value, it interacts
with other systems almost identically to the system described by a numerically equal eigenvalue,
but significantly different from the case of a numerically equal expectation value.
