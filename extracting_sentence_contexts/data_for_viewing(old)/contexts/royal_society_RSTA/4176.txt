A nice illustration of the accuracy of perturbation theory is given in [16]; a modified version : <
of their fig. 3 is shown as figure 7. It is possible to measure the ‘distance’ along the kicked rotor’s Dos
unstable manifold, /, and use it to order the pairs of trajectories mentioned above. In figure 7a, : 8
the actual action difference and the first-order perturbation theory approximation are plotted : S
versus |. The two curves are so similar that one cannot distinguish them. In figure 7a, it appears : 7
as though only a single curve has been drawn. This verifies the excellent accuracy of classical 53

perturbation theory for a strongly chaotic system. There are some interesting properties of the
action difference curves. Given the relation between action differences and phase space areas,
each local maximum or minimum in the curve occurs at a crossing point of the perturbed and
unperturbed unstable manifold. It is at those locations where the sign changes from a positive
action difference to negative or vice versa. In fact, the difference of the value between a minimum
and the next maximum, or maximum and the next minimum, is the area contained between the
two manifolds from the loop formed by successive crossing points. We will return to these areas
just ahead; here let us call the set {55j}. Following the behaviour of the perturbed and unperturbed
manifolds over a great distance leads to a statistical behaviour in their action differences. This is
shown in figure 7b. There is a classical action diffusion in action differences, and hence a central
limit theorem for their distribution, i.e. a Gaussian limiting density with a variance given by the
diffusion constant, equation (2.12).

(c) The overlap integral
The fidelity, equation (2.10), can be written as an overlap integral over position space by inserting

a complete set of position vectors,
