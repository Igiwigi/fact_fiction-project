This could
be done by increasing (within limits) the conductivity near the surface of the earth. This additional conductivity might either be concentrated in a thin shell at the surface,
or spread throughout the thick shell surrounding the core. The available direct evidence
appears to favour the first of these alternatives, for the thin shell might be accounted
for as representing the influence of the relatively highly conducting oceans, which
cover the greater part of the earth’s surface, The conductivity of sea-water is, in fact,
about 4 10-!! e.m.u., which is considerably higher than the surface value (4 x 10~'
e.m.u.), of «, given by the distribution c of fig. 1; on the other hand, the measured
conductivity of surface rocks is only about 10>!
