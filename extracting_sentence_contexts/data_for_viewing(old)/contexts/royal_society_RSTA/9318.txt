for cesium, yet both give positive ions, having about the same velocity. We
conclude, therefore, that the ionic velocities observed are not of the values of
fkX, but the maximum possible velocities kX. It follows that when a salt mole-
cule ionises, the ions sometimes last long enough for their velocity to be measured
before they recombine. The method used to measure the ionic velocities indicates
the maximum velocities, not the average velocity for a large number of ions.

According to the most recent theories of ionic velocity, the velocity depends
chiefly on the nature of the gas in which the ions move, and not much on the
mass of the ions. We should, therefore, expect & to be about the same for ions of
different salts all moving in the same flame.

The fact, first discovered by Gouy and here confirmed, that the luminosity due
to sodium salts varies nearly as the square root of the concentration indicates that
the luminous molecules are produced by a binary reaction from the sodium salt.

Tf the luminosity is due to atoms of sodium, a possible reaction is Na,O+CO =
2Na+CoO,.

CO and CO, are both present in large quantities in the flame, so that their
concentrations may be regarded as constants, and therefore the concentration of
the Na will vary as the square root of the concentration of the Na,O. Probably
nearly all the salt is converted into Na,O in the flame so that the concentration
of the salt is proportional to the concentration of the Na,O, when the concentration
is not very small.
