Thus, while Ad. 27 and Ad. 30 produce practically no “volatile neutral
compounds” and have respiration coefficients approaching unity, Ad. 36 gives a large .
yield of this type of product and has a very high respiration coefficient. The carbon balance sheet for P. luteum (non-ascosporic form), Ad. 30, has several
interesting characteristics. Of outstanding interest is the fact that while the titratable
acidity is only 0-6 c.c., the “carbon in non-volatile acids” gives the relatively high
figure of 0-477 gm., corresponding to about 11 per cent. of some compound precipitated
as a calcium salt in 80 per cent. alcohol. The explanation for this will be found in
Part XIII, in which are described the preparation and properties of a mucilaginous
material which is a complex built up of units of a malonyl polyglucose. It titrates
as an acid having a combining weight of between 400 and 500, and is precipitable as
a calcium salt from 80 per cent. alcohol.
