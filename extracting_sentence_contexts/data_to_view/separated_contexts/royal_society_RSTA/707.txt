As is clear the emission power peaks just below the I-point and minimizes just
above it. This behaviour has a marked dependence on the array size, as the contrast between the
power maximum and minimum becomes more pronounced as the array gets larger. The fact that
dipolar losses and extinction are drastically reduced just above the I’-point suggests a stronger
role for quadrupolar excitations in that region. Furthermore, this indicates that the incident plane
wave couples relatively less strongly to the nanoparticles in this region of energies and other types
of driving could be more relevant, such as driving from nearby dipoles of dye molecules. In figure 3, we showed an example of dipolar distributions below and above the I’-point.
