For these integrals to make sense, we need ne w! (L© 0 H?,L®) with Aon € Les
Now suppose that (u',e) and (u?,e*) are two weak solutions of class L! to the Stefan

problem with data ( ft, eh) and ( f?, @ in LI [x L1(Qo), respectively. We know that there exist : =

approximations (fh, ehn)r ( 2 en) e Le x L™(Q) of the data satisfying [=

These approximate data give rise to the approximate solutions e} and e?, both of which are 1S

elements of L?S.. It follows from above that eh +e! and (4 > ein Lie Now consider the : _

Regarding the right-hand side, by writing by, — Cn = bn — eh + % -e+ 9 e3,, (and similarly 8
for the f!) and using triangle inequality, along with the fact that e! — ¢ — e! et in Liv we can
take the limit in (3.11) as n > oo and we are left with what we desired. a
