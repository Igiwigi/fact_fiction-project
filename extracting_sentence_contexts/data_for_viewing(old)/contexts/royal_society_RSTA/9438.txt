To explain the non-separation of carbon when the mixture 3CH,+20,, was exploded,
it must be supposed that whilst one-third of the methane is directly transformed into
CH,OH),, the other two-thirds cannot, for lack of oxygen, get beyond the CH,.0H

stage, and that, therefore, the subequent thermal decompositions are restricted to
those of such hydroxylated molecules as CH;.OH and CH,(OH), which do not involve
any separation of carbon.

The above view of the matter is also consistent with another notable fact, namely,
that in the case of mixtures intermediate between 2CH,+0,, and CH,+0, (vide
Table III.) the minimum proportion of the oxygen appearing as steam in the products
is found, not with 2CH,+0,, as might at first appear likely, but with 3CH,+20,.

During the relatively long cooling period, which follows the attainment of the
maximum explosion temperature, the following secondary interactions may come into
play, namely : (a) the reversible change CO+OH, —~CO,+H,; and, in the case of
mixtures containing less oxygen than 3CH,+20,, (b) the interaction of steam and
carbon C+OH, = CO+H,; or, possibly (c) some slight interaction between methane
and steam.
