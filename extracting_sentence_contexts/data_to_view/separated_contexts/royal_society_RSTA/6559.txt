Con-
sequently, we cannot make the necessary and suflicient condition (4-4), for the existence of
a solution of the type Ia, I1d, IIIb, independent of p,. However, a sufficient condition,
which is less stringent than (4-4), can be readily obtained. This depends on the fact that if
A>1 for p = 3f2/4E, a solution of the type Ia, IT4, IITb exists. When p = 3/7/42,

A= (55) LA-(PALat (BAhs

and the sufficient condition for the existence of a solution of the type Ia, I1d, IITd is

3 \3
(se) (A-U? Lat PAY >}

In a similar manner sufficient conditions for the existence of the various other types of
solution can be obtained and are tabulated in table 2.
