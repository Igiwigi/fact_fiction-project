One of the most fascinating applications of precision
laser spectroscopy consists of measuring the Boltzmann constant from the shape of an atomic or
molecular spectral line. As is well known, the width and the shape of spectral lines, from an absorbing medium
in the gas phase at thermodynamic equilibrium, provide a variety of quantitative information
on the gas itself, from both the microscopic and macroscopic points of view. In fact, from the
accurate analysis of an absorption profile, it is possible to retrieve the strength of a given line,

from which the transition dipole moment between two quantum states can be inferred, and the : =
line centre frequency, providing direct information on the involved energy levels. Nowadays, : yy
similar data for diatomic and triatomic molecules are of the utmost importance to test the accuracy 2
of new methods and strategies for ab initio calculations [1,2]. Furthermore, if the shape of a : S
given line is accurately recorded as a function of the gas pressure, then line broadening and 22
shifting coefficients can be determined.
