Hence (and this may be verified by previous work) the number of two-part com-
positions is

18. The graph of a composition, traced from A to B, passes over certain segments,
nd may be said to follow a certain line of route through the reticulation. Other
compositions in general follow the same line of route; they all have their defining
hodes upon the line of route, and a certain number of defining nodes will, in general,
€ common to all of them.

Consider the path AcbB in the graph given below. All compositions whose graphs
ollow this line of route must have the node b; b, in fact, is an essential node along
this line of route.


854 MAJOR P. A. MACMAHON ON THE THEORY

Essential nodes occur on a line of route at all points where the course chang
from the B to the « direction.

We may regard a line of route as defined by these essential nodes since the line
route is completely given by these nodes.

Every composition-graph involves nodes of two kinds—
