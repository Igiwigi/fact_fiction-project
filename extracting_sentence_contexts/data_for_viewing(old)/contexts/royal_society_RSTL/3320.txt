cylinder, not in its axis, but in its wall. This cylinder or secondary muscle-cell—
rounded off and closed at one extremity—continues to grow like a simple cell; but
only in its length, for in breadth it does not increase at all, but rather diminishes.
The longitudinal growth, however, does not take place merely at the extremities, but
in the whole extent of the cylinder; as is scen from the cell-nuclei—which at first lie
near together—separating from one another, and even becoming much elongated
themselves. Thus the muscle-fasciculus « (Plate XXX. fig. 18.) becomes con-
verted into 3. There now occurs the deposit of another substance upon the inner
surface of the cylinder-wall,—that is [upon the inner surface of ] the cell-membrane
of the secondary muscle-cell, —whereby the wall becomes thickened and the cavity of
the cylinder reduced in size (compare the fibre y with 3). That the thickening of
the wall is not a thickening of the cell-membrane itself, as in cartilage, follows from
the fact that the cell-nuclei do not become pushed towards the cavity of the cylinder,
but remain lying at the outer part, in the situation they occupied before the secondary
deposit began. This is shown in 3. The secondary deposit continues until the cy-
linder is entirely filled. The deposited snbstance becomes converted into very fine
fibrilla, which run longitudinally in the cylinder. These are-the primitive muscle-
Fibres. They thus together form a bundle—the primitive muscular fasciculus—which
