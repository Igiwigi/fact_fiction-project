Let us now compare this. result, with the fact as related by
D1oporvs. lt is stated by this author, that AGaTHocLEs was
8ix days on his passage, from Syracuse to the coast of Africa ;
although he used the utmost expedition, being, in fact, closely
pursued by the Carthaginian fleet. The place where he landed
was called Azrepizs, the Quarries; whence he proceeded to
the neighbouring cities of Meyaay Tia, Megalapolis, or the
Great City, and AevzoÂ» Tore, White Tunis. The position of
these cities is not handed down to us; all that we know is,
that the latter place ( which must not be confounded with the
present Tunis) was two thousand stadia, or two hundred and
twenty-nine English miles, distant from Carthage.
