Between these extreme cases a varying degree of disorder at various length scales
broadens the reflectance bandwidth or reduces iridescence. The different optical properties are obtained by producing three-dimensional structures
of materials with different refractive indices (RIs). In fact, it is the RI contrast between the
components forming the functional structure that determines the scattering efficiency. The RI
values of the cuticular scales of the butterfly Graphium sarpedon are 1.57 and 1.54, at wavelengths
400 and 600 nm, respectively [85,86], considerably higher than the RI of air (approx. 1). Similarly,
the RI of guanine is in the order of 1.83 in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the crystal
platelets contrasting to the cytoplasmic spaces in gonophores for which the RI is estimated to be
around 1.34 [82].


(i) Exploiting the helicoidal arrangement of the cuticle

Many insects, especially beetles, are known for using the helicoidal structure of the integument
to produce vivid iridescence [87,88].
