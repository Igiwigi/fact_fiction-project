In the Decapoda it is generally accepted that at least part of the vitellophags give rise
to the mid-gut and do not entirely degenerate. Work on the origin of the liver, however,
is not critical. The organ is usually said to be formed from three paired rudiments
arising partly or entirely from the endoderm (KinesLey, 1889, SoLLAuD, 1923, REICHEN-
BACH, 1886, and Brooks and Herrick, 1893, ete.). It is, however, possible that the
formation of the liver in the Decapoda is directly comparable with that of the Peracarida.
In Astacus (REICHENBACH, 1886) and Gebia (BouTCHINSKY, 1894) the posterior liver lobes
arise from the incurled edges of the “entoderm platte,’ the origin of which is not
described. It consists of a plate of epithelium behind the proctodeeum on the posterior
dorsal side of the yolk sac, and from RetcHENBACH’s figures lies distinctly external to the
secondary yolk pyramids. In fact, it bears exactly the same relation to the yolk pyramids
as the epithelial liver rudiment does in Hemimysis. ReicHeNBACH states that the
anterior and middle liver lobes arise in a similar manner, but he describes yolk cells
separating from the pyramids to give the liver epithelium (pp. 107-11). His figures of
this process are not convincing.

Now in the Palemonine Sottaup (1923) has described a structure, the “ lame
intestinale primitive,” which occupies the same relative position as the ‘* entoderm
platte ’ of RetcHensacu, and he emphasises the homology of the two structures (p. 181).
It arises from some of the last-formed mesodermal elements in his “ bouchon blasto-
porique.” Thus if the ‘ entoderm platte ”’ of Astacus and Gebia is formed in a similar
manner, the posterior liver tubes in these types must be mesodermal. In the Palaamonine
SoLiaup describes yolk cells becoming epithelial at the edges of this mesodermal plate,
