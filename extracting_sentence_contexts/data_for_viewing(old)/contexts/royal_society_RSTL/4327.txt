to its law, and in a very great degree as to its amount. The sun also will of course
produce a diurnal inequality, which will depend upon his motions by laws similar to
those which have been mentioned, and which will combine with and modify the lunar
diurnal inequality. The determination of the solar, as well as of the lunar effect, is
requisite, both for the construction of accurate Tide Tables for each place, and for the
comparison of the tides with their theory. But this regard to the solar effect is not
needed, either to make up such a general view of the progress of the tides as that at
which I here aim, or to predict the general course of the tides 80 as to know whether
the morning or afternoon tide will be the greater.

44. In stating that the lunar diurnal inequality alone appears in a conspicuous
form in the facts, I do not rest merely upon theoretical views or upon a few cases ;
but am able to show it to be 80, by numerous, distant, and extensive series of obser-
vations. These observations also enable me to trace the course and modifications of
the diurnal inequality along the greater part of the shores of the Pacific; and I sball
state their general results for that purpose.

I shall make this statement in words and figures, without offering to the reader
any of the diagrams by which the results have been obtained, I am still of opinion
that by far the best method of discussing tide observations is to lay down the original
observations (both the heights and the lunitidal intervals) as the ordinates of curves.
When this is done, the eye perceives at once seyeral of the leading features of the
case; the diurnal inequality and the semimensual inequality, especially, It per-
ceives also where the glaring anomalies are ; and we can often thus discern what
