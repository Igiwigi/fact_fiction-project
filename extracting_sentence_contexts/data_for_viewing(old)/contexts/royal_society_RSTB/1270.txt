of the previous section had probably made invisible. The cells below the are
sporium are also showing the first signs of that activity of growth and divisi
which results in the formation of the stalk of the sporangium. Fig. 28 shows
rather later state with less regular segmentation, while in fig. 29, the first p
clinal divisions are appearing in the cells of the wall of the sporangium. (N.B, T
section is not exactly median.) Finally in fig. 30 is seen a sporangium in which |
the essential parts are present. The enlarged head is borne upon a short and rat
massive stalk, and it is bounded externally by a wall composed for the most part
two layers. Of these the inner would divide subsequently, and the inmost la
thus formed would be the tapetum. The basal part of the tapetum is already pres
as the irregular series of cells which adjoin the base of the sporogenous mass,
latter is already showing signs of the separation and rounding off of its ¢
preparatory to the formation of the tetrads. Taking all these facts together
is plain that the development of the sporangium of Phylloglosswm corresponds |
essential points with that of Lycopodium Selago, as laid down by GoxrseEt,* or
described more in detail in later pages of this memoir (p. 511, &e.).

To gain an adequate knowledge of a solid body such as the sporangium
Phylloglossum, transverse and tangential sections must also be examined ; but, ow
to the small quantity of material, the details could not be so completely worked
as they will be in some species of Lycopodium to be dealt with later. Transvel
