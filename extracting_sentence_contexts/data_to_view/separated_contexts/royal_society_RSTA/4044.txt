Hence, CER EOS had the
freedom to fold back and remain in the same bilayer. Because of the reduced mobility in multi-
lamellar structures of SC lipids, a definitive answer to the equilibrium conformation adopted by
CER EOS would require an expensive free-energy calculation that has not been attempted here. However, equilibration may, in fact, not be relevant for understanding the SC in vivo. The much
higher than physiological temperature for chain melting of SC lipids and strong confinement
between corneocytes may make the pathway of formation far more important for SC lipids than
for liquid-disordered bilayers of phospholipids. CERs are converted to galactosylceramide by
addition of a sugar moiety immediately after synthesis in the stratum granulosum.
