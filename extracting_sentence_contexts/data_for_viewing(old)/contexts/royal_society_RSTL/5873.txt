p MR. HANCOCK ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BRACHIOPODA. 807

"These large canals at the roots of the arms are continuous with those of the spirals, and
terminate in blind sacs, one at each side of the cesophagus, close to the mouth. On
making a transverse section of this part of the arm", the enlarged terminal portion of the
brachial canal is seen connected with the external edges of the dorsal and ventral
members of the loop; and the pallial lobule, stretching between the inner edges, forms
a sort of flattened inner tube. This inner tube opens widely into the perivisceral
chamber, is in fact a prolongation of this chamber, and terminates at the anterior
extremity of the lateral portion of the loop, forming what may be designated the bra-
chial pouches.
Z At the proximal extremity of the arms the semi-cartilaginous grooved ridge is continued
Qacross the median line?. The cirri are inserted into an elevated base behind the groove,
a in front of the latter there is a stiffish membranous fold, which runs along with it
Sand the cirri to the distal extremity. This brachial fold rising from the edge of the
Soroove forms it into a deep, narrow gutter, within which the mouth is situated at the
Sposterior junction of the arms, the cirri of course being behind, the fold in front. The
Zeirri are, there can be little doubt, clothed with vibratile cilia as in the Polyzoa, and the
Scurrents they excite will draw the nutrient molecules down into the gutter, along which
Zthey will be hurried to the mouth, the gutter itself being undoubtedly likewise ciliated.
2 The cirri are very fine, 80mewhat compressed on the contiguous sides, tiff and rigid
