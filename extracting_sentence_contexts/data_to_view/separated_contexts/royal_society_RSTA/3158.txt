first one and Ag = 0.0125 at the second. These choices were motivated by the fact that at high
c the solitary wave must be resolved with a finer grid in order to feel the regularization of the
potential. Better results for the theoretical predictions at the first bifurcation could be obtained
by substantially increasing the system’s length; however, this would render the linearization
problem rather unwieldy. Despite the numerical issues discussed above, these results are generally in very good
agreement with the theoretical predictions.
