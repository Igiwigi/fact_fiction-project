R, A. SAMPSON ON STOKES’S CURRENT FUNCTION, 505

vanishing at the edge. As an example of the analysis to which the use of the expression leads, I will now
find the value of for a surface approximately spheroidal, say p = p)+ «,1, (q),
where «, is a small quantity whose square will be neglected.

a First suppose 7 an even number ; let us then assume

3 ¥ = 1, (g) [Byp + Cal; (p) + DH, (p) + B.A, (p)]

5 +1, (g) [8H (p) + DyHy (p) + BH, (P))]

3 + I, (q) [BsHs—2 (p) + DiHs (p) + Bus 2Ha+ 9 (P)]
3 + Taso (2) [Be42He(p) + Dir 2Hn+2(p)],

, 5 at which point we shall find that we may stop; in fact, there are n + 3 constants in
4 the above expression, and n/2 + 1 terms, each of which yields two equations corre-
5 sponding to dib/dp = 0, dyb/dq = 0; we are thus left with one constant arbitrary, which
5 is determined when we know the velocity at infinity. It is clear that all the constants
‘3 except B,, C2, D, are of the order of a,, and hence, at the surface, we may put p = py

4 in the terms where they arise as coefficients.
