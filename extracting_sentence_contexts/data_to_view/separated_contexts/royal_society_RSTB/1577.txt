The cavum sinus imparis, the atrial cavities, and the
sings ondolymphaticus are apparently normal so far as their mutual relations are
concerned, and lie on the wpper surfaces of the basioceipital and the anterior portion
of the “ first” vertebra. The relations of the scaphia to the literal walls of the two
wivin would also seer to be noimul. The dorsal wall of the caytum sinus imparis,
lowever, must be fibrous, or at all events the cavum is nol roofed in by horizontal
plates from the exoceipitals; and in the fact that the sacculi ovcupy mere depressions
8 in the eranial surface of the basioccipital, and are not surrounded by almost. complete
% osseous vapsules, deanthicwsalso differs from Hypophthulrins und inost other abnormal
Bilovidi, and resembles the Loricaroid types, The relative positions of the sacouli,
& the cayum sinus imparis, the sinus endolymphatious, and the atrial cavities almost
negative the possibility of any forward dislocation of the anterior vertebra into the
cranial eavity having taken place, Claustra and intercalaria are probably absent,
or at all events are neither figured nor mentioned by Rersswen. The seaphium, as
in some other 8, abnormales and in the Loricaroid genera, has neither condylar nor
ascériding processes, and, as is the ease with the great majority of the abnormal types,
the tripus has a straight or but very slightly curved “crescentic” process.
