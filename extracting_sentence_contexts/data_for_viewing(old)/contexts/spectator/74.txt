But 'tis so still to run the frantic race.

Ã†n. ii. 471. 	So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake,
Who slept the winter in a thorny brake;
And, casting off his slough when spring returns,
Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns:
Restored with pois'nous herbs, his ardent sides
Reflect the sun, and raised on spires he rides;
High o'er the grass hissing he rolls along,
And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.
