From the preceding account of the development of Haliotis tuberculata it is obvious
that Bouran’s statement is not fully justified for this species. In Haliotis a rapid torsion
does actually take place in early pelagic life, but it involves only 90° rotation and the
further 90° of revolution are completed gradually after many days have elapsed.

From the work of Bouran on Acmaea (1899) and DrumMmonp (1902) and ERLANGER


DEVELOPMENT OF HALIOTIS TUBERCULATA 261

(1891) on Paludina, NaxE¥ (1913) concluded that slow achievement of torsion by growth
processes is a secondary modification found only in less primitive gastropods. There
is obvious discrepancy between Naer’s conclusion and the ontogenetic facts for
Haliotis, for in this undoubtedly primitive member of the Prosobranchia, the accomplish-
ment of complete torsion takes about 2 weeks.

In the light of the existing knowledge of gastropods, the theories of torsion which have
been favourably received have sought for the cause of the twist during the adult life
ofa hypothetical primitive mollusc (BUTscHit 1887, LANG 1891, PLATE 1896, FLEURE 1902
and NaeF 1913). Others are of opinion that torsion was not primarily developed in
the interest of the adult, but is a larval adaptation; those who seek for ontogenetic
evidence are BouTan (1899), ROBERT (1902), PELSENEER (1911), GARSTANG (1928). How
far ontogenetic facts can be used in relation to phylogenetic theory is problematical.
If only from the point of view of their possible bearing on the existing theoretical
views, such facts may be enlightening, for as DRumMonp (1902) remarked, knowledge
