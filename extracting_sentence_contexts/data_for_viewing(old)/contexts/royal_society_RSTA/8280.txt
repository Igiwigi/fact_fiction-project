ranging from 17 to 126 grams, might clearly have been derived from ingots such as those
in group “ A,” passing, no doubt, through the stage represented by group “ B.”

While all these specimens are more or less rectangular in section, the smaller ones,
represented by sub-groups 0.2, 3 and 4, are rather more regular in shape. Again
adopting the nomenclature of the steel industry, the specimens in group C.1 are
conveniently described as “ billets,” and those in groups C.2, 3 and 4 as “ forgings.”
A few of the specimens, such as Nos. 12/C.1-1, 13/C. 1-2, 14/C.1-3 and 15/C.1-4,
are thinned out at one end, indicating that a portion of these specimens has been
forged down to some smaller section, and cut off.

Specimen No. 20/C.1-9 is exceptional. It has a truly square section and is fractured
at each end; in fact, on seeing it one cannot escape the idea that it may have been
broken from a manufactured steel or iron bar. Clearly this does not fit in with
Farapay’s regular plan of dealing with the material he melted. On the other hand,
he must certainly have had plain or ordinary carbon steel or iron for use as the raw
material in the making of his alloys. It must be borne in mind that Farapay speaks
of his experiments as relating to “ Steel and Alloys” as if the base material of his
experiments in certain cases was steel, to which special elements were added, and in
other cases wrought iron was the basis, though there are only a small number of these.
The form represented by this specimen No. 20/C.1-9 would further seem to have been
very convenient for packing into the crucibles. The possibility that this specimen
represents the steel or iron base used in Farapay’s experiments on alloy steels has,
therefore, been specially considered later in studying the results of the chemical analyses
and micro examinations.
