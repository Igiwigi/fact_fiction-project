Nitrobenzene was directly reduced to aniline, whilst nitromethane
was converted into methylamine at 150° to 180°, and into methane and ammonia at
350°. The most remarkable results of all, however, were obtained with a mixture of
carbon monoxide (1 volume) and hydrogen (3 volumes), which the authors state was
completely transformed into methane and steam when passed over finely divided
nickel at 250°. Whilst there can be no gainsaying the facts relative to the extraordinary
“activity” of hydrogen when it is condensed or occluded by many surfaces, metallic
and otherwise, opinions will probably differ as to the cause of the “activity.” Many
will attribute it to the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule at the moment of
occlusion, whilst others will possibly connect it with some influence of hydrogen
upon the rate of emission of ions by the surfaces involved. The experiments of
