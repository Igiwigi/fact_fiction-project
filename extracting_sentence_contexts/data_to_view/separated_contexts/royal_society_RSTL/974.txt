Consequently, if we fix upon
any two tints in this scale of colour, or any two values of M,
the same succession and the same number of alternations of
colour must invariably intervene between them, however we
pass from one to the other. In a crystal with two or more axes, the value of M for any
ray C must of course be zero in the direction of the axis, and
therefore if the same supposition of the independence of M
on © be made, the same conclusions should follow ; namely,
15t. that the extraordinary ray must always vanish in the
pole, whatever be the thickness of the plate ; and 2dly, that
the same succession and number of alternations of colour
should intervene between the pole and any assigned unequi-
vocal tint, such as black, or the pure brilliant green ' of the
gd order of NtwrToN's scale. Both these conclusions are
totally at variance with the facts above detailed, as to the
developement of colour in the poles, and the situation in the
order of the rings of what we have called the virtual poles. Hence we are necessitated either to give up the theory of
alternate polarisation altogether, or to admit the dependence
of the multiplier M on c, or 'on the nature of the ray. Let
us see to what this will lead us.

According to the theory of the polarised rings if extended
to crystals with two axes, the number of periods performed
in a given space (=1) by a molecule of a given colour,
transmitted in a direction making angles 0,08 with the axes,
can only be a function of the form k.v (8,0'), k depending
on the intensity of the polarising force ; or as before, being a
function of c, the nature of the ray, and of the intrinsic energy
of the molecules of the crystal.
