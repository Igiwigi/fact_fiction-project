Figure 1. (a) Rate of energy dissipation €(t) as a function of t corresponding to equation (2.1) at constant power input.
(6) Behaviour of the kinetic energy E(t) for the same time window. Looking at E(t), we can easily distinguish two different
dynamical phases in the system: a laminar phase where E(t) ~ t and an avalanche phase where we observe drops of E(t)
corresponding to the bursts in the energy dissipation. (Online version in colour.)

solid) obey completely different physics and the variable F is not at all related to any plastic flow.
In fact, as we shall see, the scaling observed for the avalanche sizes and their interevent time are
completely different with respect to the one observed in amorphous solid.

In figure 1a, we also report the signal corresponding to the energy dissipation for the same time
window, which shows, as expected, a strongly intermittent behaviour. Notice the link between the
strong fluctuations occurring in the upper signal and the kinetic energy loss in the lower signal.

3. Event definition and scale invariance

Having in mind the signal shown in figure 1, we define an avalanche as the event for which
dE/dt <0. The starting point of an event is identified by a change in the sign of the derivative
of kinetic energy in time, from positive to negative; meanwhile, the opposite change in sign of
dE/dt identifies the end of the avalanche or energy drop. In figure 2, we illustrate our definition.
