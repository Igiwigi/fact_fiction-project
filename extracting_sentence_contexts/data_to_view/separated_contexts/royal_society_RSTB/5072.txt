One should expect retraction of the eyes into the sockets to be a very common pheno-
menon in the Reptiles, on account of the immovability of the head. and the constant
danger to the eyes from their position close to the ground ; but apart from this retrac-
tion I have observed no movement in the eyes of the Amphibia. The axes are asa rule
directed more forwards, 7.¢., more towards the median line of the body than in the
reptiles, but among the frogs and toads I have invariably met with a considerable
divergence from the median line, amounting to 45 or 50 degrees. In the lizards the axis of the eye is always nearly at right angles to the body ; in fact,
it may even exceed 90°, i.e., the axis of the eye may be directed slightly backwards. For example, in Lacerta simonyi and L. viridis, it amounts to 100°. The Sphenodon
possesses a divergence of 85 degrees.
