only at the anterior part of the tuberculum where it forms a communication between
one side of that lobe and the opposite side of the medulla oblongata. Tts bundles are
een to arise from the complex of fibres of origin of the trifacial in the central portion
of the tuberculum, then to wind round the central nucleus of finely granular matter
or 8ixth layer, to pass beneath what there is of the fourth ventricle and finally to
pass beneath that ventricle to the other side, where they are lost quite close to the
lateral and inferior edge of the medulla oblongata. This commissure is traceable in
the myelencephalon as far forward as the posterior side of the cerebellum.

The commissura ansulata, (fig. 6) occurs further back than in Mugil, being placed
beneath the cerebellum instead of beneath the middle of the valvula cerebelli. That
it is the commissure which is displaced backward, rather than that the cerebellum is
displaced forward, is I think indicated by the fact that the root of the oculomotorius

is directed obliquely backward from its ganglion to its exit, whereas in ordinary Teleostei
it passes directly downward ; I speak here of course in reference to the position which
these animals habitually assume. The commissura ansulata consists of the game two
divisions as in AM. cephalus, bub the parts which it connects are slightly different.
It derives its lateral fibres from the base of the wings to which it acts as a commissure ;
