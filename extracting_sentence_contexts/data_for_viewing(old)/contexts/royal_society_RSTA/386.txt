visioning of the future can encompass drivers of future sustainability, which
are far more diverse than climate alone, such as those used in the Millennium
Assessment [24].

Fifth, there is a small but genuinely difficult class of decisions where risk-
hedging is necessary. For example, Steffen et al. ({25], box 9) argue that this
is the case in post-fire management in the Victorian alpine forests. Here, the
trees that will provide nesting hollows and microclimates for many other species
in 120 years’ time need to be established now; yet in 120 years different tree
species are likely to be successful under different futures. In this case, the only
option is to consider risk-hedging by promoting the establishment of different
species in different parts of the same landscape, in the certain knowledge that
some of them will turn out to be the wrong choices. The fact that some
adaptation decisions may be so awkward needs recognizing, particularly as
the likelihood of a 4°C world increases. However, this category of decisions
should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the majority of decisions is
less awkward.

Most of these observations have been recognized in the academic literature for
at least a decade, but have not yet been integrated in a form that resonates
with and informs practical decision-making on adaptation. On the contrary,
in our experience of interacting with practitioners, much of the language used
about adaptation emphasizes once-off, small adjustments to existing practice
in which objectives are unchanged but pursued with climate change taken into
account. In this mental model, adaptation is the means to ensure that we can
