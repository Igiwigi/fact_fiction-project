When we for purposes of calculation
imagine the elastic quality to extend across the section of the wire, and so ayoil
consideration of the discontinuity in the medium, we must imagine as above a flow
rotational displacement along the wire so long as the capacity of one of the condensers —
is being altered; and the velocity in the field will be deducible, by the ordinary a
formule for a continuous medium, from this ideal flow together with the actu:
changes of displacement throughout the dielectric. For a perfect conductor
circumstances will be exactly represented by confining this flow to its surface; wha
is required to make the analytical formule applicable, without modification ©
account of discontinuity in the medium, is simply the addition of such an ideal flow
at the places of discontinuity as shall render the displacement (/, g, 4) circuita
throughout the field, without disturbing its actual distribution in the volume of tl
media. The kinetic and potential energies of the medium may in fact either be caleula ‘
for the actual configuration, when they will involve surface integral terms extend
over the surfaces of discontinuity, or they may be calculated as for a continuo
medium if we take into account a flow of displacement along these surfaces, such |
we would require to introduce by some agency if the medium were perlec
continuous, in order to establish the actually existing state of motion throughout 1

in estimating the energy of the medium in terms of the flow of displacement these
| surface sheets must be included, after the manner of vortex sheets in hydrodynamics,
In the same way, when the electric charge on a conductor is executing oscillations,
a vortex sheet of changing electric displacement, such as will make the displace-
ment in the field everywhere circuital, must be supposed to exist on the surface of
the conductor. }

49. There is this difference between actual electric current-systems and the
permanently circulating currents, or vortex rings, in this ethereal medium, that the
latter move in the medium so that their strengths remain constant throughout all
‘time, while alteration of the strength of an electric current is produced by electro-
‘Aynamic induction. In our condenser circuit, however, the strength of the current
j nds on the rate of movement of the plates of a condenser, that is, it is uffected

changes in the rotational strain-energy of the portions of the medium which are

ated in the gaps across the conducting curcuit.
