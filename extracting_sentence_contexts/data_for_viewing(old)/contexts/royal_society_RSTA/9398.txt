N=2'+y'M.
In this section one example only will be considered, namely, the tangential reaction
when the lubricant consists of a single pure chemical substance and is reduced to two
primary films by the use of a spherical slider or by a heavily loaded plane slider. The
equation will be taken in the form »=6b—aM., in which yu is the coefficient
of friction (F + load).

ais a parameter wholly independent of the nature of the solids. It fixes the slope of

the curve and is a pure function of the configuration of the molecule of the lubricant.
For normal acids, alcohols and paraffins the expression aM can be written in the form
¢ (x — 2) where x is the number of carbon atoms in the chain. In this form, it shows
the remarkable fact that each such carbon atom produces the same effect up to a chain
of thirty atoms which was the longest chain tested. The configuration of the substances

used is :-—

Paraffins .. ‘sy .. CH,;—CH,— ..... .— CH, — CH.
Aleohols .. Pr .. CH,—CH,—.... ..—CH,—COH.
Acids a2 at .. CH, — CH, .... +. -— CH, — COOH.

The carbinols are aleohols in which the hydroxyl group has been shifted to
the third position.
