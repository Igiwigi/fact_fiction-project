The dentary bone also exhibits a cylindrical rod of cartilage projecting from its pos-
terior angle, and extending across the inner snrface of the mandible. The vomer and
presphenoid are developed upon the under surface of the interorbital and nasal car-
tilage; only the projecting osseons lamina, contributing to the formation of the inter-
orbital septum (which is almost rendered complete by a thin upward expansion of
the cartilage), is still larger than in the Pike. In fact it may be briefly stated, that,
with one exception, the processes of growth are the same in the Pike and in the
Perch, only modified in the latter fish by the greater extent to which the osseous
tissne has displaced the cartilaginous. The exception to which I here refer is the vertebra. This bone is wholly osseons.
