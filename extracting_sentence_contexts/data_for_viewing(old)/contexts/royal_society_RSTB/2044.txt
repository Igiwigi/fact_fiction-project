Here we see that about a fifth of the sea-urchins had pure white spines, about
two-fifths violet and white, a fifth brown and white, and the remaining fifth mixed
colours. There is thus a very distinct tendency to the formation of well-marked
varieties. This is emphasised by the fact. that, of the violet-white individuals,
considerably over half belong to the violet-white class, i.e., had the larger portion of
each of their spines pigmented, and that more than two-thirds of the brown-white
individuals belonged to the brown-white class. Again, the group of individuals in
which the brown and violet pigments were mingled was the smallest of all, instead of
being the largest, as would be the case if there were no tendency to the formation of
varieties. Some of the individuals in the violet and brown groups had, it is true, a
tinge of brown or violet, but it was not thought sufficient to relegate them to the
mixed colour group.

It is not to be concluded, however, that, because of this tendency to separate into
varieties, there is necessarily any segregating agency at work. â€˜Thus it is a well-
