In other words, it is exactly as much diminished by
the conversion of part of the energy of relative motion of contiguous spheres into
energy of stream motion as it is increased by the introduction of the term ==Rr as
the spheres acquire diameter c.

Comparing the actual value of p with what it would be if, with the same total
kinetic energy, the spheres were material points, we see that it is diminished in the
proportion 1 + «:L.

The number of collisions per unit of volume and time is proportional to ¢*T'.; that
is, to «'/(1 + x). It is less in the proportion 1/(1-+ x«) than it would be if, with
the same total kinetic energy, the spheres had velocities independent of one
another,

21. From the fact that p is independent of «, it follows that local variations of
density, i.c., of x, do not involve the expenditure of any work on the whole, and
therefore such variations may and will come into being. 22. BottzMANN’s minimum function continues to diminish by collisions, finally
attaining its minimum constant value when the distribution of velocities defined by

- our assumption in 13 is established, but its actual value when minimum differs by
$ log D from what it would be if the spheres were material points.
