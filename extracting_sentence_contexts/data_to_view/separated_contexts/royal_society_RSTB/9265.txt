Body size affects the ability to survive and

reproduce via a diversity of mechanisms including competition for limiting
resources and for mating opportunities, and predation avoidance [3,4]. Life-
history theory also has to explain ‘what keeps organisms small’ (despite often
documentable benefits of being larger), with studies indicating the roles of natural
enemies and disease [5,6], and reviews focusing on costs of large size such as
delayed reproduction and high energy requirements during or after growth
[7,8]. Here we focus on an underappreciated cost: because growing to a larger
body size requires more cell divisions (this is a simple corollary of the fact that ani-
mals vary much more in cell number than cell size), it is difficult to build a larger
body without elevating the cancer risk experienced by the organism. Most of what is known about the biology of cancer risk is based on experi-
mental cell cultures, laboratory mice and correlative evidence found in human
populations. Evolutionary ecologists rarely include cancer in their lists of
sources of mortality for non-domesticated animals, which reflects a tacit
assumption that parasites, predation and starvation are of overriding import-
ance in the wild.
