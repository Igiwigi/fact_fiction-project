HERON-ALLEN: CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF THE

recognised fact:! The living Foraminifer is apparently sensitive to light? I had
oceasion to prove this, by taking advantage of the fact, in photographing the
Gromiide to which reference has been made, of which a specimen appears in figs. 9
and 10. In that case, the Gromia having become lost among weeds, a small hole
was punched in a piece of black paper and affixed to the glass side of the tank, and
a beam of strong light directed through it; within an hour three independent
specimens of Gromia had crawled into the circle of light thus formed.’ That they
are sensitive to touch is made manifest to anyone who observes the living animal,
for if the extended pseudopodia are disturbed with a needle beyond a reasonable
point the animal sulks, retracts its pseudopodia, and in my experience may remain
sulking for days.‘ A much more delicate and controversial question is that of the
function of the protoplasm, when extruded in the form of pseudopodia, as a weapon
of offence or defence. It is an interesting question whether the pseudopodia do, or
do not, secrete some toxic, as well as sticky, substance which not only catches but
kills entangled organisms, such as is seen in the well-known figure of ScHuLrzEe
above referred to, which has been cited as a proof that digestion of food-victims
may take place outside the shell in the network of -protoplasm formed by the
anastomosing pseudopodia,® but it will be observed in Scuutrze’s figure that
several Pleurosigmata equal in size to the entangled individual are indicated
inside the body of the animal.
