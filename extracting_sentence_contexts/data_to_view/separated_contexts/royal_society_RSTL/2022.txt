Another opinion respecting the function of the nerves has been maintained,
and lately by a writer of great respectability *, which deseryes to be considered,
because it claims the support of experiment, and if well founded must essen-
tially affect our opinion of the nature of the neryous influence. Dr. Hzxsy appears to admit the independence of the muscular power, but
thinks he has rendered it more than probable that the nervous influence,
instead of being only one of many agents, is the only one capable of ex-
citing the muscular fibre ; and consequently that all others act through it, s0
that they are not in fact stimulants to that fibre, but to the nerves alone,
through which they influence it.

64 DR. PHILIP ON THE NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS

It is true that as mechanical impulse affecting a nerve of yoluntary motion
is capable, after its separation from the brain and spinal marrow, of exciting,
through it, the muscle in which it terminates, and we cannot be assured that
we have separated from the muscular fibre the whole of the neryes with which
it is 80 intimately blended; if we were in possession of no other facts on the
subject, we should be led to the inference, that the excitability of the muscular
fibre can only be influenced through its nerves ; but when instead of a mecha-
nical, we employ a chemical agent, we find the result very different.
