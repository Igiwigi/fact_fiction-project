specimens have resin canals, so that among plants five years old there are about equal
chances of finding specimens with and without resin canals.

and other spruce species. On making sections, as we did at short intervals in preparing
the charts and tables for the preliminary investigation, we found that the plant suddenly

the case of the young plant it frequently happens that the primary tap root is lost at a
