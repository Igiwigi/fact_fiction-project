noted by Janssens (39, p. 22). This fact is due to each alternate filament having
an interlamellar extension which spreads antero-posteriorly, and brings the internal
or interlamellar opening of the water-passage opposite the internal edges of the
intervening filaments (fig. 29, ile). It is worthy of remark that Rice (83, pp. 51-55),
in spite of the enormous differences in the gill-structure of Dreissensia and Mytilus,
objects to the dissociation of these genera.
