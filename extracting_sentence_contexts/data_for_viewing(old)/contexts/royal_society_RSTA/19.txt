The application of continuum models to SCR [28,31,32] has revealed that the SCR typically
has a thickness in the nanometre regime, consistent with experimental evidence [26,33]. The
widths depend on applied potentials and the dielectric properties of the solid electrolyte, with

thickness possibly reaching the order of a few angstr√©ms for materials with small dielectric


constants [31]. This implies that the SCR can occur over only a few atomic layers adjacent
to the interface, as experimentally observed, for example, by Chen et al. [26], for LiyV2O5
electrodes in contact with Li; 5Alo,5Ge1,5(PO3)4 solid electrolyte. The limited thickness of the
SCR restricts the applicability of continuum models, which are typically valid only for SCRs
with widths above 10 A [31], and confines their utility to describing qualitative features and
providing rough estimations. This limitation stems from the fact that such models ignore the
electronic structure of the solid electrolyte and neglect the description of discretized defect-
defect interactions within the crystal lattice sites, which cannot be adequately described by bulk
dielectric screening.

To appropriately model these aspects at the atomistic level, it is crucial to recognize that
electrostatic potentials arising from the formation of an SCR have a profound impact on the
creation of charged point defects because their presence directly influences the formation
energy of such defects [34]:
