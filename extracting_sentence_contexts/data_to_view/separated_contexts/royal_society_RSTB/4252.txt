At its dorsal end it is cranio-
caudally flattened but over the rest of its extent it is cylindrical. Below the connec-
tion with the cervical thymus, it tapers to a blunt point and is slightly curved in the
caudo-ventral direction. The pouch differs especially from that of the last embryo
in the fact that the ventral solid portion in that stage has now grown down for a
distance of 0°08 mm. (left side) below the connection with the cervical thymus as the
well-marked tapering process above referred to. The pouch has a total dorso-ventral
extent of 0°26 mm. and is thus longer than that of the last embryo.
