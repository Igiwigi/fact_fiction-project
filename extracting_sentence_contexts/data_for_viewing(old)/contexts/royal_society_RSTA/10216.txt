The temperature coefficients of conductivity and of viscosity are approximately
equal in the case of aqueous solutions. This is not so in solutions in the solvents
examined by us, although in these, also, a rise of temperature conditions an increase
of conductivity and a decrease of viscosity. It is interesting to note that the
increase of conductivity is, in nearly all cases, greater than the decrease of
viscosity.

The foregoing summary shows that failure has attended every attempt which has
© been made to express the power of forming conducting solutions as a function of the
solvent only.

As a matter of fact, every solvent exhibits a very marked selective action as
regards the nature of the conducting solute. Thus water dissolves the majority of
salts to form solutions which conduct the current; organic bodies also, other than
salts, are in many cases soluble, but the solutions are not conductors. Hydrocyanic
acid behaves similarly to water, but only a few salts are appreciably soluble in this
é solvent. Ammonia, sulphur dioxide, and some other solvents form conducting solu-
tions, not only with many salts, but also with a few organic substances not usually
classed as electrolytes. The halogen hydrides, on the other hand, form conducting
solutions with non-saline organic substances, as well as with salts of the ammonium
bases, but such solutions are not formed with metallic salts.

It is evident, therefore, that the ability to form a conducting solution is a function
of both the solute and the solvent, and this has been recognised in the various
