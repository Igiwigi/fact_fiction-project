In the historical
introduction to this paper I have already indicated the extent to which the researches
of M. QuaTreraces have proceeded in that direction. To him undeniably belongs
the credit of having independently determined the fact of the existence of *a fluid‚Äù in
the visceral cavity of the Annelid. The first publication of his generalized results
occurs in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for 1852. The results of wy dissections,
announcing the existence of a chylaqueous system of fAluid in the Annelida, were
first made public at the Meeting of the Bvitish Association, which was held at Swan-
Sea in the year 1849.
