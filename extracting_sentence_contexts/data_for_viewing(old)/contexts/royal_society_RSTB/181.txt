Lesion—Removal at one operation of the marginal gyrus (its posterior three-
fourths), ascending parietal, parietal lobule, ascending frontal and posterior half of
transverse frontal convolutions on left side of brain. Lived seven days.

Result.—Absolute right hemiplegia, both limbs and trunk being paralysed. Head
rotated to same side. Face drawn over to right. Trunk arched, with convexity to
right. Right leg is dragged, right arm drops from shoulder. Can support itself only
by aid of left limbs. Drinks with paralysed side of mouth immersed in the fluid. No
recovery observed up to time of death, which occurred on the seventh day.

The brain is represented in fig. 16. It would appear as if part of the ascending
parietal and the parietal lobule were not involved in the lesion, but in fact they were
completely softened and undermined, so as to render it impossible to suppose that
any part of them could have continued to perform its functions. The lesion of the
marginal gyrus is very complete. ‘

Lesion—Almost identical with that recorded of the preceding brain, but on the
right side. The cortex of the whole frontal lobe, except the anterior fourth and a
strip along the lower margin; the ascending parietal convolution. The lesion is more
complete at the upper and lower ends of this than in the centre, where only the
part next the furrow of Rotanpo appears to be involved; moreover it does not
include the parietal lobule and the part of the marginal gyrus corresponding in
