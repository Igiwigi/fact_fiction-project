This quantity is not given by the difference of the. circumferences of any
other layers, since the circumference over any layer cannot be taken as the true
circumference below the next layer, for each layer sinks down a little into the hollows
between the wires of the layer beneath. The mean of the values obtained from the
two coils is 6°0 divisions. That this value is probably very near the truth, is shown
by the fact that, if we divide the mean value of the width of the groove by the
number of turns of wire which fill it, namely 12, and express the quotient as a change
in circumference and in terms of divisions of the steel tape, we get 6°0 as the value. Hence, taking 3°0 as the amount which has to be deducted from the circumference
over any layer to give the circumference of the circle coinciding with the axis of the
wire, we get the following values ;—
