H. BRAGG ON X-RAYS AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. 263

The spectra resemble those of zine blende, except that the odd orders of the (100)
spectra and the second order of the (111) spectra are not merely abnormally small,
but have entirely disappeared. These facts are very simply explained. The structure
is obtained in exactly the same way as that of zine blende; but the two lattices are
alike, both being of carbon, and when their influences interfere, the interference is
complete. Finally, consider the case of fluor-spar (CaF,) for a special reason.
