fic heats of a gas we can calculate the relative rates

From the ratio of the two speci
of increase per degree rise of temperature of the energy of translation of the molecule

as a whole, and the energy due to the motion of the atoms relatively to the centre of

gravity of the molecule. If f is the ratio of the rate of increase of the internal energy to that of the trans-

lational energy, we have the well-known equation—
B+1=2/{3(y— 1h,
where y is the ratio of the specific heats of the gas,

Thus the constant y has a high theoretical value as leading directly to a funda-
mental dynamical property of the molecule, and a knowledge of its value for a large
number of gases suitably chosen would not improbably afford material on which to
base a theory of the configuration and motions of the atoms in a molecule, or would
at least give valuable data by which to test theories based on other considerations. Stated briefly the following is the present state of our experimental knowledge of
the ratio of the specific heats.
