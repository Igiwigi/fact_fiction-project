The cell diameter continues to decrease
until it reaches a minimum size and the cells either form auxospores or die. In this respect the centric diatoms differ from the Pennatae (see p. 23). Another
difference is found in the fact that in centric diatoms the auxospores formed by cells
of different diameter show a great variability in size, whereas this is rather uniform in
pennate diatoms. Cytological studies in Ditylum have produced some evidence in support of PERsIpskyâ€™s
views, that a reduction division and an autogamic sexual process precedes the forma-
tion of auxospores in centric diatoms. The observation of young auxospores of Ditylum
containing one big and two small nuclei especially strengthens the probability of the
occurrence of these processes in Ditylum.
