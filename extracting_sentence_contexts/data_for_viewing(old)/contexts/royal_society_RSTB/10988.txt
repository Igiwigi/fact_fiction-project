rate and maximum biomass accumulation under salinity
and temperature stress. Under control conditions (20°C and
26 PSU), a positive biodiversity effect was recorded; however,
this was not the case in the stress conditions (27°C and 7 PSU,
respectively) [57]. Hence, these manipulated experiments
show that clones possess particular phenotypic characteristics
and that they may dominate under a specific set of con-
ditions, but as environmental conditions change, the clonal
dominance will change. The suite of differentiated pheno-
typic properties intrinsic to the constituent clones would
likely be of benefit for the population. The response of a
diatom population to stress and how effectively it can
handle short-term disturbances may in fact depend on the
level of genetic and phenotypic diversity. A constant but
varying external selection pressure in a highly dynamic
environment would serve to maintain phenotypic diversity
within the population.

So far, only abiotic factors have been discussed as drivers
of diatom species or population phenotypic variability. How-
ever, studies of A. formosa indicate that viruses, bacteria or
parasites could constitute drivers of clonal specialization.
For instance, certain clones can survive infections by one par-
ticular virus but not by another and are metabolically active
only when the former virus type is present but not the
