466 JOHN Z. YOUNG ON FUSED NEURONS AND SYNAPTIC

that the whole giant-fibre system on each side of the body consists of the processes
of one of the two main giant cells. In fact the arrangement is much more complicated
than this, and contains two curiously opposite features of the greatest interest for the
neurologist (Young 19366). First, the processes of the two main giant cells provide
a clear case of the complete fusion of the axons of two nerve cells, thus infringing the
strict canon of the neuron theory. Nevertheless, and this is the second point, there
are also present, elsewhere in the system, discontinuous synapses which are perhaps
more clear and easy to study than any yet described.
