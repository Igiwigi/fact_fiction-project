372 MR. E. B. POULTON ON THE COLOUR-RELATION BETWEEN EXPOSED

An examination of the dates at which pupation took place in A. and C, unfortunately
shows that in nearly all cases an important part of Stage III. had elapsed before the
larvee were pinned on the frames. It is quite clear that A., 6, 8, and C., 6, 8, 9,
cannot have been influenced after the transference, and there were probably only two
larvee in A. (3, 4), and two in C. (1, 5), which may be considered to have satisfied the
conditions of the experiment. The larve which were found to have pupated by 12 p.m.,
September 4, cannot have passed as much as 13 hours on the frame, and most of them
must have had a very much shorter period of time. The larve of B. and D., on the
other hand, seem to have passed the whole of Stage III. on the frame, and one of the
most curious and exceptional things in all the experiments recorded in this paper is
the fact that the larvee of D., surrounded entirely by black for the whole stage, should
be lighter than those of A. or D., which were also partially exposed to gilt, and
had been on the frame for a much shorter time in nearly all cases. In other respects,
however, an analysis of the few results in which the influences had worked for an
adequate period of time is very satisfactory.
