Hence the
special effect in question must be due to the fact that connexion with the air-spark
terminal interferes in a special manner with the electrical state of the tinfoil, and the
peculiarity must consist in the fact that the period of the charges (and consequent
variations of potential) is such that they keep time with the pulsations in the tube. Now the displacement of electricity, which would otherwise give the standard relief-
effect, may be interfered with either by exaltation, or by reversal, or by diminution. The last alternative is excluded by the experimental fact that these special or non-
relief-effects do not resemble any of the series of relief-effects which we have described,
and which range from zero to the complete to-earth effect. To decide between the remaining alternatives we may adopt a similar course. Like
the relief-effect, the special or non-relief-effect, may be obtained in other than the
complete form we have already described.
