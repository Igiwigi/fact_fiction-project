wrison, for they prove that the small xylem-elements are spiral trachez, which thus
onstitute the protoxylem or first-formed elements of the primary wood (see Plate 22,
fig. 4, which represents a radial section, passing through a primary xylem-strand,
bordering on the pith). It will be seen that the tracheides to the exterior of the
yrotoxylem are scalariform, while those on its inner side are pitted. There is a sharp
stinction between the primary xylem and the tracheides of the secondary wood.
The structure described remains constant throughout the stem. ‘The position of the
protoxylem is maintained, as the bundle passes out from the pith (see Plate 23, fig. 9)
and remains the same after it has reached the pericyle (see Plate 22, figs. 5 and 6).
It cannot be too strongly emphasized, that the protoxylem does not lie on the limit
of the primary and secondary wood, but is placed in the interior of the primary strand
tself, so that the development of the primary wood must have been partly centripetal
and partly centrifugal. This fact is well illustrated by fig. 6. The leaf-trace shown
in that figure has reached a point on its outward course where secondary wood is no
longer formed, yet the position of the protoxylem in the interior of the ligneous
strand is quite obvious. That the centrifugal wood to the outside of the protoxylem
is not secondary but primary, is proved, both by the irregularity of its arrangement,
s shown in transverse section (see figs. 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8), and also by the character of
the markings on its walls (see fig. 4). The limit between the centrifugal primary
‘wood and the true secondary wood with radially arranged elements is perfectly sharp
2 (see figs. 2, 8, 4, 5, and 8). In many cases the two are actually separated by
parenchymatous cells.

We are convinced that the same interpretation holds good for the foliar bundles
of Cycadeze, and that here also the centrifugal part of the wood must be regarded as
