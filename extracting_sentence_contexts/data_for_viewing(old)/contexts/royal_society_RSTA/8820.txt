When this is done it is found that the terms due to the first power of the argument
lead to the Gaussian image point, so that the series begin with a term involving the
second power of the argument in the case of the longitudinal aberration, and the
third power in the case of the transverse aberration. These terms are the first order.
The following terms next in sequence, which are of fourth and fifth power respectively,
are spoken of as aberrations of the second order, and so on.

A considerable amount of theoretical work has been done on aberrations of the
first order by SEMEL, ABBE and others, and the treatment of these is fairly well
known. Unfortunately, it is found in practice that the first order aberrations do not
give a sufficient approximation for the optician’s requirements. In fact for a certain
range of object and image positions, they are so badly out that they cannot be
said to constitute an approximation at all. This fact has long been recognised by
optical designers, whose practice is invariably to calculate, using the exact trigono-
metrical equations which involve no approximation at all, the correct paths of a
number of selected rays, from which they draw conclusions as to the efficiency, or
otherwise, of the proposed system from the practical point of view.

The trigonometrical method, however, from the designer’s point of view, has the
radical defect that, while it gives partial information about the performance of a given
system, it gives no direct intimation of the direction in which the elimination of various
detects is to be looked for, and it entails a long and laborious process of seeking for
the optimum by trial and error.
