In particular, there is no freedom to prescribe the inverse square
law; it is in fact dictated by the geometry of space-time. It is remarkable to note that Newtonâ€™s
Law follows from the space-time geometry. This is the fact which is not generally appreciated and


acknowledged upfront like this. This is evident from the fact that no textbook makes this explicit
statement. Also note that A naturally arises as a constant of integration without any acrobatics of trace free
or unimodular gravity [6,7].
