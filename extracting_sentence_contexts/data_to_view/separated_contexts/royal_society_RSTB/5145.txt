We are probably, therefore, justified in
believing that the mean frequency of stomata per unit area is appreciably higher for the
leaves of trees than for the leaves of shrubs. To appreciate the significance of this
conclusion it is important to recognise that the means represent averages based on the
examination of both sun-leaves and shade-leaves, and, therefore, the mean difference
between the two layers is not to be attributed to comparison of exposed sun-leaves
from, the tree layer with partially shaded leaves of the shrub layer. There is, in fact, an inherent tendency for the members of the higher tree layer to
exhibit a higher stomatal frequency than that shown by the members of the shrub
layer, even when both are growing in the open. This is best shown by comparison of
extreme values given below :—
