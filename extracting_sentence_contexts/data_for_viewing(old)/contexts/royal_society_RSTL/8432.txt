at p. 158. It would have been difficult, however, before the development of the principles contained in the
preceding paper to haye shown the insufficiency of those yiews.

As they still linger in the minds of some geologists it seems desirable to advert to them here. Hrnscmzr's
views are found, as stated by himself in letters to Sir Cnarres Lyers and Sir Rovertcx Murcms0x, in vol. ii. of
