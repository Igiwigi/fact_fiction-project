Calculations of hydrogen adsorption at a metal vacancy on the {010} surfaces suggest that Ss
the hydrogen-compensated system is energetically preferred over the defect-free {010} surface :s
of forsterite (relative to an isolated Mg in the vacuum phase), while for fayalite the situation is =
reversed and adsorption of two hydrogen atoms at the neighbouring oxygen sites compensates =
only partially for the energetic cost of creating the metal vacancy. :g

Findings for the lowest-energy structures of hydrogen over the forsterite surface compare well :&
with the embedded cluster QM/MM work of Goumans et al. [19], where physisorption over the :
Mg site (approx. 18A Mg-H separation) and chemisorption over an O site (0.97 A O-H bond)
were deemed to be the most probable interactions with the unmodified {010} surface. The fact
that our results give essentially the same conclusions using a significantly different model gives us
added confidence in the accuracy of the calculations involving fayalite and the defective surfaces.

Further work will extend this study to include hydrogen adsorption at alternative olivine
surfaces to compare their reactivity to that of the dominant {010} surfaces. Other avenues to
explore include the use of nudged elastic band techniques to study surface diffusion of protons
and hydrides and the formation of molecular hydrogen and/or water at the surface, and the
modelling of solid solutions of the Mg,Fe olivines to study the effect of the presence of both
cations at the surface on the hydrogen adsorption processes. Finally, we will also investigate the
use of embedded cluster calculations to increase the surface area of the relevant surfaces, firstly
to evaluate possible sources of error arising from the presence of periodic image interaction,
and secondly to obtain surface hydrogen coverages that are more realistic considering the low
