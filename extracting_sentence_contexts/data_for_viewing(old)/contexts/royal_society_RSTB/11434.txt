senses. They also tend to fall into taxonomic, hierarchical categories, such as
animals, tools and living things, owing to clusters of co-occurring features
(‘has legs’ and ‘has eyes’), and are intuitively easier to reason about. A large
body of evidence now indicates that such concepts are based, at least partially,
in action and perception systems of the brain, a view referred to as embodiment,
or more generally, grounded cognition [1-5]. Abstract concepts, such as democ-
racy, philosophy or evaluation, on the other hand, are messier and are more
difficult to characterize and categorize. They evoke complex and rich experi-
ences involving episodes and situations, emotions, relations, introspection
and interoception,’ but lack a clear sensory-motor experience. However, such
concepts are very frequently encountered in language and represent one of
the most sophisticated and important abilities of the human mind. Based on
some behavioural findings, such as the fact that people list fewer features for
abstract than concrete words, and require higher response times for abstract
words, it is suggested that abstract concepts are more impoverished and ‘less
semantic’. But it is not clear that there is anything impoverished about many
abstract concepts such as justice or opinion. Semantic richness may be largely
