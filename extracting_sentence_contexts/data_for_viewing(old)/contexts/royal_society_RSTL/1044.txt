to say that the experiments were all made by myself; and I :
had resolved to repeat them before I made them public, parti-
cularly as there appear to have been some very extraordinary
and quite unaccountable differences in the results of those
made in different seasons of the year ; but having hitherto been
prevented by ill health, and by other avocations, from engag-

ing again in these laborious researches, I have thought it right
not to delay any longer the publication of facts, which appear
to me to be both new and interesting, as their publication
may perhaps excite others to engage in their farther inves-
tigation. 8

The principal objects I had in view in the following set of
experiments were, first, to determine the expansive force of
the elastic vapour generated in the combustion of gunpowder
in its various states of condensation, and to ascertain the ratio
of its elasticity to its density : and secondly, to measure, by
one decisive experiment, the utmost force of this fluid in its
most dense state; that is to say, when the powder completely
fills the space in which it is fired, and in which the generated
