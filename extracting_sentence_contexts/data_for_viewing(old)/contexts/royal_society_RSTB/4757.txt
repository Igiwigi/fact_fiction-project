Even in the extinct Amioids, there is nothing to preclude the view that certain
component parts of the “ bodies” of the vertebrae are developed independently of the
arcualia. In Hurycormus the hemal arches are attached to the hypocentra, and in
the caudal region the neural arches also are attached to the hypocentra, although in
the trunk they merely alternate with the pleurocentra, owing to the fact that the
hypocentra do not extend sufficiently upward to meet the neural arches. But there
is nothing to suggest that the hypocentra and pleurocentra are developed as
outgrowths from arch-tissue.

In Osteorhachis the neural arches alternate with the pleurocentra, and are
separate from them. While it is possible, even probable, that there are a pair of
interdorsal elements entering into the composition of each pleurocentrum, these
elements do not necessarily constitute more than a small portion of it. The fact that
the pleurocentrum is not in two parts, right and left, shows that it is not in a
primitive condition. If it is composed of interdorsalia only, one would expect to
find it a paired structure; if it consists of two interdorsals and a semicircular
structure developed from a half-ring of skeletogenous tissue independently of them,
the primitive condition would exhibit the triple origin; if, on the other hand, it
consists of the half-ring only, then the argument as to its origin from arch-cartilage
falls through. As regards the hypocentrum, although the projections that carry the
ribs are almost without a doubt basiventral elements, if does not follow that the
