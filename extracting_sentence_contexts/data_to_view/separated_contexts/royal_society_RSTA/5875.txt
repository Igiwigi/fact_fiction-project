For a comprehensible understanding
of the prevalence of different states, we plot the histogram of angle of orientation (@) of the
LSC structures in figure 3a obtained from the single long-term trajectory run. The histogram
clearly shows four bi-variate peaks in the vicinity of angles corresponding to (2n + 1)z/4, with
n=0,1,2,3. The bi-variate nature of the peaks can be attributed to the fact that corner vortices try
to destabilize the LSC structure parallel to the diagonals permanently. Only when the fluctuations
are large enough does a transition proceed. Hence, instead of a pronounced LSC structure along
the diagonal, we detected oscillations in the angle of orientation with bi-variate peaks.
