It will be seen that the shift observed is of the right order of magnitude, but that in
general it is smaller than the calculated shift by an amount which, particularly in
the case of Na, is well outside the limits of error. Also, the fact that the shift for Na
and Li is practically zero, makes it impossible to try to explain this difference by
a variation of the factor 2.

Neither does it seem possible to try to explain it by a variation of the mean energy
of the conduction-electron levels with increasing expansion. It is true that a rise in

* For example, the elementary formula to be given in § 10 gives the band width for a metal as
proportional to p§, where p is the number of atoms per c.c. This obviously gives the above result.
