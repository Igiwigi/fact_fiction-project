from the California region (32—42° N and 117-125° W) for the same period of time. The first case
gives a comparable dataset to that studied in [13], which demonstrated regional variations in the
scaling exponent, b, of the GR Law, or magnitude-frequency distribution, of earthquakes there. It
is worth mentioning that these data also contain the magnitude 9.1 event on 26 December 2004.
In fact, the 15 largest earthquakes occurring in the dataset all show a lowering of the b-value, as
reported in [13]. As earthquake magnitude is reported in terms of energy, we note that b = 2B/3
(see footnote 1, and [4]). Similar studies have been performed on different scales and across the
globe, including around the L’Aquila fault in Italy [10], in California [12] and in the northwestern
Himalayas [11].

Our measurement procedure for the b-value is similar to that used in [13]. For each case, we
impose a grid of size 0.25° x 0.25° on the whole region. Centring on each of the grid points, a
growing circular region was considered until a given number of events, 1, was captured within.
For large n, this circle may be considerably larger than the grid resolution, and its size will also
vary with event frequency. The exponent value at each grid point was then found by fitting the
magnitude-frequency distribution of those 1 closest events, using a least-squares fitting method
(as in §3a, similar results were also obtained for MLE fits). The error on the fit is also recorded as
