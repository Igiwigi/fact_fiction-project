finally are heaped up round the periphery of the protoplasm, and especially in the
neutral planes which delimit the different oospheres. It is in these neutral planes
that the cell walls arise. The protoplasm forming them stains differently from
that which fills the greater part of the rest of the oogonium, a fact noted also
by Srraspurcer. We find in preparations stained with dyes which colour cellu-
lose, that they are especially absorbed and most persistently retained in these
planes, and also by the granular protoplasm near the periphery of the oogonial
contents as a whole. Ultimately membranes are formed which divide the oogonium
into as many chambers as there will be oospheres produced.
