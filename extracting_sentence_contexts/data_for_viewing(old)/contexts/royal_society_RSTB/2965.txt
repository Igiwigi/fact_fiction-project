parts of the inner, the two tubes may be united across, forming an interlamellar
septum ; and at still lower levels the two tubes become a single one.

Fic. 35.â€”Petricola monstrosa.

This is very interesting when considered in relation with the figure of Venus
mercenaria given by Kertoee (42, fig. 70), in which the plicee have inturned
apices, There is a suggestion of a definite connection between the presence of
these intra-plical tubes and the fact that all the interlamellar septa rise high. It
is shown elsewhere that at least in some cases where the interlamellar septa are
alternately high and low (e.g., Zutraria), the low septa have median vertical blood-
tubes, which fork at the upper border of the septum, and one limb of the tube is
continued up the ascending and one up the descending lamella (see remarks on
intraplical blood-tubes on p. 175). One might, indeed, be tempted to propound the
hypothesis that plication is the outcome of the failure of the incomplete or low septa
