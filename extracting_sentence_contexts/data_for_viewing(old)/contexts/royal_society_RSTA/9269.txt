actual ones, so that our model would show an even greater anisotropy than the wood
itself. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the cross-sections of the cells are not
accurately circular, but often approach a rectangular or hexagonal shape, and that the
cells are not open, but either taper to a point or are closed in some other way.

However, the results seem to justify the conclusion that the form and arrangement
of the cells have a sufficiently large effect to account for the relative values of Hy,
and Ey.

Another fact, which is perhaps more significant, is that the theory suggests that the
ratio Ey/E, should increase with the cell-wall thickness, and therefore with the specific
gravity of the wood. ‘This is certainly the case for the four woods already considered,
and there does not seem to be any obvious alternative explanation of this fact.

A further conclusion from this theory is that E,, should be approximately proportional
to the specific gravity for all woods. This is also in agreement with experience. (See,
for example, Jounson’s ‘ Materials of Construction ’ and the Report by C. F. Jenkin,
mentioned above, both of which contain graphs in which the values of E,, are plotted
against the specific gravity for a large number of woods.)

§ 4.2. “ Apparent Potsson’s Ratios’ for Model.—We may now inquire whether the
relative values of the six Potsson’s ratios are explained to any extent by this theory.

It is evident that when the model is compressed axially the lateral extensions will be the
same as for a solid body, and we may therefore expect that the corresponding Porsson’s
