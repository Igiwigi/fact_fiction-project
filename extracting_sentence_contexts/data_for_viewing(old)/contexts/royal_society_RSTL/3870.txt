in the fact that successive series of filaments are given off from them at each distribu-
tion of nerves from the ganglionic enlargements, while the relative size of the lateral
portions of the cord appears to be greater in the posterior than in the anterior. On
this account I have named these lateral fibres, febres of reinforcement of the cord.

In regard to the identification of these fibres, it may be well further to state, that
their separate existence is indicated chiefly at the postero-lateral margin of the gan-
glia, (fig. 7. f) where they are scen to form part of the nerves and cord without passing
upwards to the brain. In other parts of their course they are not distinguishable by
colour, and very rarely by any longitudinal line of separation from the fibres which
form the inferior longitudinal series, or portion of the cord, to which they are ap-

proximated ; but from which they are believed to be distinct from the fact, that they
do not ascend with them to the brain. Their function must be regarded only as

reflex ; entirely independent of sensation, but capable of being excited into action by
external causes.

The existence of these lateral fibres in the cord may now fully explain the reflected
movement of parts anterior or posterior to an irritated limb on the same side of the
