occurs in the form of large blocks, sometimes as much as 800 feet long and 15 metres
thick, which are embedded in boulder clay and completely thrust over the Danian.
Ossicles from these erratics have been collected at Jordberga and Hiisthogshiisen.

The Danian.—These beds, as the name indicates, are characteristically developed
in Denmark. Neither Ammonites nor Belemnites have been discovered in them.
The characteristic fossils are Nautilus danicus and certain Gasteropods which are
characteristic of the Tertiary. This disappearance of the Ammonites, which have
previously characterised the Secondary deposits, and the appearance of the precursors
of the Tertiary Gasteropods have induced some authors to place these beds in the
Eocene. It will be seen by a reference to the zonal table (pp. 164, 165), that the
Asteroids of the Danian are very closely related to those of the Upper Senonian and,
in fact, belong to groups of forms which are as characteristically secondary as the
Ammonites, and, like them, do not proceed upwards into Tertiary beds. Recent
researches by Dr. BriinnicH NretsEn (35), based upon a study of the Brachiopoda,
have disclosed that the Danian chalk can be divided into three horizons: (1) The
* older” Bryozoa-chalk, (2) the ‘ newer” Bryozoa-chalk, and (3) the Crania-chalk.

Dr. Nigetsen kindly sent me a large collection of Asteroidea made in the same
localities as those from which he had obtained Brachiopoda. Investigation of these
fully bore out the distinction he had established between the “older” and the “newer ”
Bryozoa-chalk. No large terminal supero-marginalia of Metopaster mammillatus are
found in the “ newer” Bryozoa-chalk, for the species series has so far advanced that all
members show catagenesis in this character (see p. 115). A variety, retiformis, of
Teichaster favosus is also characteristic of these newer beds.
