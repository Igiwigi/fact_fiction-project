M+P, sin (£+4,) + P, sin (24+) +...,

where M is the arithmetic mean of the 12 monthly values, ¢ is the time counted from
the beginning of the year, 1 month being taken as equivalent to 30°, while P,, Py,...,
6,, 02,... are constants.

Table VI. gives for a variety of elements the values of the amplitudes and phase
angles of the yearly and half-yearly terms, and the ratios borne by these amplitudes
to the mean value of the element and to one another. As before, in the amplitudes
unity represents 1 volt per metre. The angles are given only to the nearest degree.

The representation of the annual variation by two terms of the series is, as a
matter of fact, not very close in any one of the elements. This may mean that other
shorter period terms are by no means negligible, or merely that a larger number of
year’s data are necessary for high precision.

The annual term is, in all cases, the more important of the two. The relative
importance of the semi-annual term is much greater for the day fall than for the
other elements; it is least for the mean value for the day.
