The cause of failure in the H-cells is of a different nature. Many of the earlier
cells had been found to break in the amalgam leg, and the trouble was attributed to a
hardening and expansion of the contents ($ 29). Such a hardening had, in fact, been‚Äù
observed in one or two cages. More recent experience, however, has proved that the
cause must be looked for elsewhere, several cells having failed in which no trace of
solid amalgam was to be found. Nevertheless the amalgam is the cause of the
trouble, for out of a large number of breakages not one has occurred in the leg con-
taining pure mercury.
