The first striking fact shown by the table is the uniformly slower speeds derived
from the doublet at 4925 as compared with that of the least refrangible line of the
adjoining triplet, and we have assured ourselves that there is no difference in displace-
ment between the two first components of the triplet. The third component is too
weak and too near an air line to admit of satisfactory measurement. It was one of
the main objects of our investigation to discover, if possible, such differences in the
velocities as might indicate the presence of different kinds of molecules, but we
hesitate to ascribe the differences found to such a cause. The line 4925 is the least
refrangible component of a double line, which is wider and much stronger at the
base than in the centre of the spark. In order to measure the displacement, the cross
wire of the reading microscope has to be set on the edge of the displaced line, first
near the pole, and then on a corresponding point nearer to the centre of the spark
gap. Where the line is strong, the edge of the line would be the least refrangible
