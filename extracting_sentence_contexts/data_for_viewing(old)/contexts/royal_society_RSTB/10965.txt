likely to be important contributors to differences between
males and females.

(a) Sex chromosome aneuploidies

The viability of 39,X mice (i.e. lacking either an inactive X or
Y chromosome) was cited by Lyon as evidence to support her
hypothesis of inactivation [1]. However, in humans, over 99%
of 45,X conceptuses fail to survive, suggesting a much more
important role for the second sex chromosome, and alluding
to differences in escapees between humans and mice that is
further explored in §3. Hook and Warburton suggested that
all viable 45,X (Turner syndrome) females in fact have an
undetected cryptic mosaicism, as true 45,X is not viable
[10]. The importance of either the inactive X or Y chromo-
some in normal human development implicates a role for

one or more of the 17 human genes that retain X-Y hom-
ology, particularly the nine in which Y (and inactive X)
expression is not shared with mouse [11]. As the X-Y con-
served gene pairs’ products are enriched in regulatory
functions, they can have widespread impact on the transcrip-
tome. Their continued presence on the Y chromosome, and
escape from inactivation on the X chromosome, argues for
a strict requirement for continued dosage equivalence, an
