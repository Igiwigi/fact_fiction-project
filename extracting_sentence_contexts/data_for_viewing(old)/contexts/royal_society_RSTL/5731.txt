It is clear that this is the case with respect to each factor of the product

0,=f(s) Ho) H().F(&")=5BRPB«
Therefore it is also the case with the product itself; and since the like is true with
respect to the other five values of 0, it is also true with respect to any symmetrical func
tion of the six values. Consequently each coefficient of the sextic in 0 is the leading
coefficient of a covariant. At present, however, we haye only to deal with the last
coefficient, that is, the symmetric product.
21. II is a seminyariant * reduced to zero by the operation

* The term © Seminyariant” js due to Mr. Carrey, who in a letter to me dated March 22, 1560, 8ays,
«The meaning is a function which is reduced to zero by one only of the operators which reduce to zero
an invariant. It is in fact the leading coefficient of a covariant. Tt may also be defined as a function of
the coefficients which is not altered by the substitution of #+7 for x.” Defined as functions of the coelſi-
cients which are not altered by the snbstitution of &+73 for &, seminyariants are what Mr. CoOKLE (who
discussed such functions 8ome years ago in the third and concluding yolume of the « Mathematician, and
-more recently in some of the other journals referred to in the foot-note under the first paragraph of this
paper) calls © critical functions.” T may add that some years since My. CooxLe pointed out that the
factors of the resolyent product, and, consequently, the product itself, are critical functions.
