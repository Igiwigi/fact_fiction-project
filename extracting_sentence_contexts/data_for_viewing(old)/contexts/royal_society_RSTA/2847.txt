are the elliptic integrals of first kind (see, for example, [46] for more details on these functions and : o
their properties). : a
The core of the proof consists in showing that these dynamical modes together with the :3
infinitesimal generators of homotheties, translations, rotations and hyperbolic rotations (i.e. those : &

transformations preserving the set of ellipses), form a basis of L?(R/2zZ). This is one of the main
difficulties (maybe the hardest one) involved in the extension of the perturbative result in [11] to
the case of perturbations of any ellipse, as studied in [43]. While in the former case, one can take
advantage of the fact that these functions can be considered small perturbations of the Fourier
modes, in the latter new strategies need to be exploited.

In [43] we consider analytic extensions of the action-angle coordinates of the elliptic billiard,
more specifically, of the boundary parametrizations induced by each integrable caustic (these
functions can be explicitly expressed in terms of elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions).
A detailed study of their complex singularities and the size of their maximal strips of analyticity
allowed us to deduce their linear independence (both for finite and infinite combinations) and,
by a suitable codimension argument, to show that they form a complete set of generators, thus
completing the proof that they are a basis of L?(R/2xZ).
