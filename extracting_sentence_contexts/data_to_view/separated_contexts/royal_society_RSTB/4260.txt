Remarks on Thymus 1V.—HamMaARk in his review (19, p. 208) points out that no
case is known of the constant occurrence of a thymus IV amongst the Mammalia, and
goes on to remark “da ganze Siiugerordnungen diesbeziiglich unerforscht sind, ist
allerdings die Méglichkeit zurzeit nicht ausgeschlossen, dass es wirklich Siiuger mit
konstant dimetamerem Thymus-Typus gibt.” That possibility is now seen to be
realised in Trichosurus, which thus acquires the distinction of being the first mammal
to be described in which thymus IIT and thymus IV are constantly present. The fact that thymus IV may occur amongst the Eutheria appears to have been
first definitely established by GroscHurr(13) in a paper published in 1896. He
stated that it occurs constantly in the Calf and Cat, occasionally in the Sheep, as traces
in the Horse and Goat and he inferred its presence in Man. In a later paper (14) he
corrects his former statement in regard to its constancy in the Calf and Cat and states
that it is not of constant occurrence in any mammal but is to be regarded only as
more or less frequent in those mammals which possess an epithelial body IV.
