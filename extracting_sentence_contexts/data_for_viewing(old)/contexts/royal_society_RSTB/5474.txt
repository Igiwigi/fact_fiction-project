perichordal tube is always most insignificant, but this is to be expected in a type where
the notochord itself assumes microscopic proportions. It is certain that the notochord
is the nucleus of the vertebral column but never in itself a supporting structure. The
sheath, probably impregnated with chondrogenous substances, persists within the
centrum as a continuous tube even when this structure is almost completely bony
(Plate 14, fig. 24, p.ch.sh.). The process of ossification commences with a breaking-down
of both dorsal and ventral perichondria, although Rosin and BarpEEN maintain that
the dorsal perichondrium alone is ruptured.

In conclusion to this part of the discussion, it might be pointed out that the bulk of the
centrum is not derived from the interventralia, which contribute only to the postero-
ventral portion of each vertebra. Hence, if the criterion which determines a Gastro-
central vertebra is the fact that interventralia form the major portion of the centrum,
then the mammalian vertebra as illustrated by that of Mus is not of this type, as Gapow
maintained.

Discussion—Perichordal Disc.

Froriep found that in the early stages of development of the vertebral column,
the “ primitiver Wirbelbogen” halves (=basidorsals) are fused with each other in the
median line, both above and below the notochord. He says that, “ der perichordale
Theil des primitiven Wirbelbogen ist an der ventralen Seite der Chorda miichtiger und
dichter gefiigt als an der dorsalen. Ich habe das dadurch hergestellte festere Verbind-
stiick der beiden Bogenhilften die hypochordale Spange bezeichnet.” Later, the
“primitiver Wirbelbogen” halves become disconnected from the perichordal part
