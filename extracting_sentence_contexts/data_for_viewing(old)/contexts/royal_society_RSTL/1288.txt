ference in the nature of the products arise from electrifying
the gas either under increased or  diminished 'pressure, the
latter of which, it appeared to me probable; from the known
influence of elasticity in impeding the combination of gaseous
bases, might prevent the oxygen of the alkali from uniting
with hydrogen to form water, and occasion the expansion of
both into the state of gas.

Having failed, therefore, to acquire, in this way, proof of
the existence of oxygen in the volatile alkali, I was next led to
8eek for some unequivocal mode. of evincing the 'production
of water by the same operation ; a fact, which would be scarce-
ly less satisfactory in establishing oxygen to be one of its
constituents, than the actual separation of oxygen gas. The
most careful observation of ammonia, during and after the
agency of electricity, does. not discover the smallest percep-
tible quantity of moisture.: In order, therefore, to 'subject the
gas'to a satisfactory test, I had recoure to the following con-
trivance. Ammoniacal gas, I had previously found, may be
80 far desiccated by: exposure to caustic potash, as to shew no
traces of condensed moisture, on the inner surface of a thin
glass vessel containing it, when exposed to a cold of o* Fan-
RENHEIT ; though the recent gas, by the same treatment, is
made to deposit water in the state of a thin film of ice. A
