he adds, appeared to be precisely the same sort of points that
illuminated the whole of the sea at the time. They were
therefore in all probability the minute kind of medusa, which
I shall have occasion to describe hereafter. GoDEHEv DE RIVILLE $tates, in a paper sent tothe Academy
of Sciences at Paris, that on opening the scomber pelamis
while alive, he found in different parts of its body an oil which
gave out much light : but it Should be observed, that RivitLe
had a particular theory to support, for which this fact was
very convenient, and that other parts of his memoir bear
marks of inaccuracy. It may be added, that if the oil of fishes
were usually luminous, which R1viLLE supposed, it would be
almost universally known, instead of resting on a solitary
observation. Asfar as T am able to determine from what I have seen,
the faculty of exhibiting light during life does not belong to
the class of fishes.
