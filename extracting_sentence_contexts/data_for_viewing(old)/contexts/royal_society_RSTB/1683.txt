of hemorrhage, &c. We will reserve the discussion of the changes in blood pressure
until we discuss the vasomotor phenomena under Part C,

Primary Effects.

(a.) Rhythm.—The passage of the bullet through the hemisphere has either no
influence, or produces a very slight effect upon the heart rate.

Thus of 59 observations the rate was absolutely unaltered in 26 instances ; very
slightly slowed (75 beats in a minute) in 4 cases; slightly slowed, /.¢., a diminution
of from 15 to 45 beats per minute, in 18 ; and in 11 slightly accelerated.

From these facts it is obvious that the cardio-vasal nerve centres are unlike the
respiratory centre, in that they are not so notably influenced by the presence of the
bullet.

Where change occurs in the heart rate it appears to be the result of an excitation,
chiefly of the vagal centre. We shall further discuss this matter in considering the
secondary effects.

(b.) Force. The force of the heart beat at the moment of the shot was roughly
estimated by the excursions of the manometer, and as will doubtless be anticipated,
in a very large majority of cases, did not show any material alteration. Thus, of the
59 experiments above quoted, in no less than 43 the force of the heart beat was
unchanged, while in seven it was very slightly diminished, and in only two instances
