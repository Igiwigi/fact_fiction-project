Such validation and updating can improve the models and enhance the
quality of subsequent predictions [24]. One major application of MD simulation that we consider is the prediction of the binding
affinity of a lead compound or drug candidate with a protein target, of major relevance in drug
discovery and personalized medicine. That target may be respectively either a generic protein
or a sequence-specific variant, reflecting the fact that individuals respond differently to a given
drug based on their genetic make-up. The binding affinity, also known as the free energy of
binding, is the single most important initial indicator of drug potency, and the most challenging
to predict [26,27]. Another case we look at here is how one seeks to make actionable predictions in
support of advanced materials discovery.
