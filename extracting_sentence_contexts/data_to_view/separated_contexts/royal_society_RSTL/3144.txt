destroyed by s0 small a quantity of nitric acid. This fact would seem to show, that
the bicyanide of mercury, and consequently other compounds of the same class, do
really possess something of the characters of the true acids, having the power, if not of
completely neutralizing a metallic oxide, at least of s0 far modifying its basic cha-
racter as materially to weaken its neutralizing action on the oxygen acid. 6. This is further illnstrated by the action of acetic acid on the oxycyanide.
