There is no separate foramen for
the hypoglossal nerve in either X, Y or Z, but the nerve issues through the foramen
lacerum posterius, together with the vagus-glossopharyngeus group ; HonigMann
finds the same in his earlier foetus of Megaptera (20, p. 82). The two occipital condyles of Skull X, as already noted in the previous section of
the paper, are feebly differentiated, and are relatively wider apart than they are in
later stages of growth (cf. figs. 2, 6); and they do not extend so high up the sides
of the foramen magnum. Except for the fact that they project. to a small extent
only, they present the appearance that one associates with the condyles of the
mammalian skull generally. In Skull Z, however, the two condyles have already
character: a character due to the fact that the
curvature of the two condyles, taken together, is that of a hemisphere.

one hand, and of Sauropsida on the other, may be explained by the rotation of
the head being effected mainly upon the occipital condyle in the latter, but about the
odontoid peg of the axis vertebra in the former.
