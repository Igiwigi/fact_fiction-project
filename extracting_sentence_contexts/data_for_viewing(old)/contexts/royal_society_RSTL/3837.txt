empty; but as I have unquestionable evidence that the former is the case in Poly-
stomella, I should think there can be little doubt that it is also true of this genus.
Now if we come to examine the purpose of this canal-system, we are at once struck
with the fact, that it can scarcely be requisite for the nutrition of the segments of the
sarcode-body enclosed within the chambers; since the mutual communication which
these segments have with each other, seems fully as adequate for the purpose in
Cycloclypeus, as it is in Orbitolites, Orbiculina, or Alveolina. If we examine wherein
this organism $0 differs from the foregoing as to require such an additional system,
we may find a not improbable answer in the possession of that additional skeleton
which intervenes between the proper walls of the chambers; for the canal-system,
excavated in the very substance of this, would seem to furnish the appropriate chan-
nel for its nutrition. And that such is its object, will be shown in a future memoir
to be almost certainly proved, by the comparison of facts then to be addaced from
the structure of other genera.

108. Monstrosities—Although the number of specimens of this type which I have
had the opportunity of examining is but small, yet two among them exhibited the
same kind of monstrosity as that which is common in Orbitolites ; namely, the super-
position of a vertical plate upon the horizontal disk (Plate XXX. fig. 3). And in each
it is sufficiently apparent that this plate has originated from the central cell, and that
its increase has taken place pari passu with that of the horizontal disk.

109. General Summary.—If, now, we review the principal facts relating to the
structure of Cycloclypers, and compare them with those furnished by Orbitolites on
the one hand and by Nummulites on the other, we sball see that, notwithstanding
