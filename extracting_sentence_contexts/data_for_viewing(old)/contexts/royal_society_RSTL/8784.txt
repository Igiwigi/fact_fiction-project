From the results given in the last three tables, it is manifest that the yalnes of p,
which in the case of a perfect (ideal) gas would always be unit, steadily diminish for
the same temperature as the pressure increases, An important exception to this remark
occurs in the last recorded result in Table XV., from which it appears that at the tem-
perature of 64* the value of p, which had diminished from 0:9478 to 0:4466 as the
pressure was raised from 17:6 to 145:5 atmospheres, instead of continuing to diminish
with a further increase of pressure, actually changes its direction, and at 223 atmospheres
has increased to 04994. No change of this kind occurs at 100?, although the experi-
ments were carried to 224 atmospheres. The explanation of this change in the value
of p, after a certain pressure has been reached, I have already anticipated when referring
to a similar change in the coefficient of expansion by heat at high pressures, as 8hown
in Table VIII. At the temperature of 64, and under a pressure of 223 atmospheres,
carbonic acid has in fact approached the liquid volume, while passing through those
intermediate conditions of matter which, in a former Bakerian Lecture, I have described
as establishing an unbroken continuity between the ordinary gaseous and ordinary liquid
states. At 100* carbonic acid under the same external pressure has not reached this
stage of the process; but if the experiment had been carried to higher pressures, a like
change in the value of Ã¾ would no doubt have occurred. 'These remarks will be fully
confirmed when 1 give the values of p for the gaseous and liquid states at the same tem-
perature, as calculated from my former experiments*. The true import of the values
of p at a constant temperature will be considered hereafter.

From Tables XIV., XV., and XVI. it further appears that thevalues of papproach more
nearly to unit the higher the temperature, in accordance with the principle I deduced
from my former experiments, that as the temperature becomes higher the curves repre-
