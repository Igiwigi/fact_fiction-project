Judged by the lumen of the ring-like centra, the notochord must have been of great
relative thickness, thus in one case the outer diameter of a ring was found to measure
0°9 millim. the inner 0:7 millim., the walls being only 0°2 millim. in thickness ; so
that, making no allowance for the enlargement which the central cavity may have
undergone as a result of post-mortem changes, the notochord would have formed more
than three-quarters of the diameter of the centrum. There is nothing very
remarkable in this, however, and ring-like remains of cyclo-spondylous vertebre
are not uncommon among fossil Elasmobranchs.

The first vertebra is distinguished from the rest by its very large and strong neural
arch, which is intimately associated with the posterior region of the skull, so that in
several cases it retains its original position more or less perfectly, although the
centrum corresponding to it has been displaced and overturned. The fact is
interesting in connexion with the apparent absence of an occipital arch, and the
suggestion naturally arises that this element may be represented by the neural arch
of the first vertebra, which though not actually incorporated with the skull seems to
be on the point of becoming so. In the specimen shown on Plate 16, fig. 3, the arch
of the first vertebra has been displaced as well as the centrum, and lies on its face ;
it has a span of 1°3 millims. and a height of 0°6 millim., while the centrum measures

0-9 millim. in. height and breadth. The total height of this vertebra is now
15 millims., while the length of the head, measured from the front margin of the
ampyx to a line joining the posterior margin of the posterior lateral masses, is
5°5 millims.
