Group 2 (1)), we have in case (i) A=V,
= I which admits of no integral solution, y, being odd and y, prime to yg; in case

(i) A= 3» 22 =b and 9,=1, 1=1; in case (ii) A=2, ==> and yg =1, 91=2. Hence the more probable symbols for boron (from these considerations) are a3; and «73:,
between which we cannot decide. The symbols which have been assigned to the gaseous compounds of the preceding
elements, silicon and boron, are to be regarded as the symbolic expression of the most
probable hypothesis as to their chemical constitution, which is consistent with the known
facts of gaseous combination. What weight, we may ask, is to be attached to snch
conclusions? Now, it has already been remarked that the weight to be given to such
hypotheses primarily depends upon the number of cases to which they are applicable.
