In the accompanying sketch of the vessels at
one part, together with those corpuscles which
were motionless in them, M represents the edge
of the mustard, « a capillary partly overlaid by
the mustard and crammed with stagnant cor-
puscles, 6 a capillary with red discs adhering
to its internal surface, but still transmitting
blood, while further from the mustard all the

corpuscles were in motion, and consequently
none appear in the drawing; c was a rouleau
of red corpuscles projecting from a stagnant
mass into the vein V, through which the blood
was flowing rapidly ; yet the rouleau, though its
free end was moved to and fro by the current,
was prevented by the mutual adhesiveness of its
corpuscles from being broken up or detached. Thus it was evident that in the capillaries of
the space covered by the mustard, the red cor-
puscles had an abnormal tendency to adhere
both to the walls of the vessels and to one another, and were on this account accumu-
lating and sticking within them, while almost immediately outside the mustard, the blood

in the capillaries presented the same appearance as in other parts of the web. This effect
was independent of changes in the calibre of the vessels, for any results of alteration in”
the size of the artery under the mustard must have been shared by the surrounding capil-
laries, which also derived their blood chiefly from it; and that the vessel was dilated
to the same degree there as elsewhere, was shown by the fact, that its branches con
tinued throughout the experiment to transmit full streams of blood after emerging from
beneath the opaque mass. I also measured some capillaries by micrometer before the
application of the mustard, and again after it had caused stagnation in them, and found
that their dimensions remained the same®,

* The increased pressure upon the blood in the capillaries, resulting from obstruction to the progres of
the corpuscles, leads to the distension of their elastic parietes up to a certain point, but, generally peaking,
not further. In the present case, before the application of the mustard, the web, irritated probably by the
yapour of the chloroform, was affected with a Slight congestive tendeney, far short of that which induces
stagnation, but yet sufficient to give rise to full distension of the capillaries, When the web has been per-
fectly healthy to begin with, I have seen a marked increase of calibre in the capillaries on the occurrence ot
