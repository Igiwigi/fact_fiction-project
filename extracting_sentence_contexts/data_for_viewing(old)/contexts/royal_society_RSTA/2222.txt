Summarizing what we have discussed above: to do point-vortex dynamics on a Riemannian
surface M one needs:

— the metric g, to define the Laplace-Beltrami operator Ag which is necessary to find the
corresponding Green function G(r, r’);

?This can be easily proved by using integration by parts,

iH |VOP do =-]] PAPdo,
g2 s2

Gauss’s theorem and the fact that the surface has no boundaries.


— a Hamiltonian formalism,
d :
q _ 9H an dp _oH
dt ap dt oq

which is naturally defined when using coordinates of the area form do = dr; A dry of the
given surface M, by setting q = rz, p =11. In the case of the plane and of the unit sphere
S*, the corresponding area forms can be written as

doge = dx A dy and dog: = d(cos 0) A dg, (2.9)
