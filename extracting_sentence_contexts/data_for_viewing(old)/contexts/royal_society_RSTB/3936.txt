days after oviposition (at room temperature) the young emerge. At first they are
enclosed in an embryonic cuticle, but this is cast off within a few minutes of birth,
and the young assume at once a form which in all but details is simply that ofa small
adult. This condition is called the first free-living instar, or, simply, the first instar.
After two ecdyses the “adolescent instar ” is reached, in which the first batch of eggs
undergo their ovarian growth (yolk deposition). Immediately after the next
moult, which introduces the “ first adult instar,” the eggs are laid. All increase in
size takes place immediately after ecdysis. Once the new cuticle has hardened, the
dimensions of the animal are fixed for that instar—at least, no further growth
detectable by the micrometer takes place. ;

The supposed dependence of the developing embryo on a nutritive fluid secreted by
the mother into the brood pouch was shown not to be a fact.

Characters used in the Experiments.

The character employed in the case of both species of Simocephalus was the length
of the body measured along its longest line, from the postero-dorsal angle of the
carapace to the front of the head. Measurements were made at two points in the
life-history, viz., in the first instar, referred to hereafter as the Birth Measurements,
and in the first adult instar, referred to as the Adult Measurements. The measure-
ments were made with an eyepiece micrometer, with combinations of lenses making
the unit of measurement in the case of the birth measurements 0°015 mm., and in
the case of the adult measurements, 0°042 mm. The experiments required, of course,
that all the measurements should be made on the living animal, which for this
