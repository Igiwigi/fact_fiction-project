from, the current in circuit 1. This suggests a simple resistance coupling, but
obviously, since such a coupling is already present in the complete circuit (r, fig. 1a),
this is impracticable. The necessary second adjustment is therefore obtained by
coupling to circuit 1 a copper ring in which current is induced. This ring is then
used as a small potentiometer for the purpose of introducing into circuit 3 a variable
p.d. which possesses a component in phase with the current in circuit 1. This
‘* zero adjuster ” is described in detail in a later section, and it is shown analytically
below that its presence need have no other effect on the working of the apparatus
provided that it remains unaltered throughout all the measurements.

(c) Effect of Harmonies

Finally, we come to a curious practical point arising from the fact that the balance
of the bridge is dependent on the frequency of the supply current and that, in order
to obtain the required sensitivity of balance, it is necessary to use a thermionic
amplifier. If the supply current is not perfectly sinusoidal, then there will be other

“harmonic ” frequencies present and the bridge circuit will act as a species of filter
for the one frequency, », which we will call the “ fundamental’, satisfying the
equation »?M,M, = Rr, and currents at the harmonic frequencies nw (n = 2, 3,
etc.) will pass practically without attenuation into the detector circuit. In the
first place this gives rise to a complex response of the detecting instrument (in our
