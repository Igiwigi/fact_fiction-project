evident that however numerous and complete our observations upon the law of ab-
sorption of light (without respect to colour) might be at all but the least thicknesses
of such red glass, it would be impossible to deduce from them alone the law of ex-
tinction of all those kinds of light for which the medium in question is very nearly
opake, as, for instance, the yellow or the blue, and consequently it would be im-
possible even to approximate to the primitive intensity of the compound incident
beam.

88. M. Bior, in the memoir already referred to on M. Merront's experiments, is 80
sensible of these difficulties, that he has contented himself with arbitrarily dividing
the incident heat into three kinds or qualities as respects extinction, calculating by
a Separate law for each, and assuming the sum as the representation of the trans-
mitted heat; a process by which, no doubt, almost any series of facts might be re-
presented, and which therefore gives very little information as to the real law of ex-
tinction.

89. I have spent much Jabour on the same snbject, of which it would be out of
place here to detail the results. I have indeed obtained a form which contains only
three constants, and which expresses tolerably the law of extinction of heat in solid
media. But this investigation satisfied me that where the medium is s0 very absorp-
tive as most solids are, it is wholly impossible to deduce the form of the curve near
its origin, from the remoter portion of it.

90. However desirable it might be to proceed by the direct analogy of media, for
which we may ascertain the law of extinction, to that of the atmosphere, in which we
