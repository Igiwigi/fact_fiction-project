It is, however,
satisfactory to note how these corroborate the others, showing, for instance, larger
values resulting from the comparison of Nos. 5 and 4 than from that of any other
pair. This may possibly be due to a smaller value of « for the stratum of gravel about
4 feet thick which separates these two thermometers, than for the higher strata, or
to the fact of No. 5 being buried at some distance (9 feet 6 inches) from the vertical
plane containing the other three. Unfortunately, when the pits were open, no very critical examination of the
character of the gravels at different depths was made; but it is proposed to repair
this omission when next the thermometers are dug up. The excessively close agreement of the mean values of /7/« derived from the
annual and half-yearly waves is very remarkable (especially in view of the fact that
the results are deduced from the observations of a single year), and seems to indicate
a high degree of precision in the observations.
