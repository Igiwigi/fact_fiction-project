wire, it does not seem at all unlikely that by increased delicacy and perfection of
the instrument, by increased velocity, by continued motion for a time in one direc-
tion and then reversal of the revolution with the reversal of the direction of the
swing, &c., it may be applied with advantage hereafter to the investigation of the
earth's magnetic force in different latitudes and places. To obtain the maximum
