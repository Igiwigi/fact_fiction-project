volume, etc), and which are not restricted to a particular time step scaling. Hereafter, we will
only focus on hydrodynamic modes, but the interested reader is referred to [9,12,64,75,105] for a
detailed investigation of the properties of non-hydrodynamic modes.

Let us start with the D2Q9-BGK-DVBE based on the standard second-order equilibrium, i.e.
which is recovered imposing Mpa =0 if p+ q> 2 in equation (2.9). Its dispersion and dissipation
curves are plotted in figure 2. From them, it is clear that this model is able to recover the correct
macroscopic behaviour, in terms of propagation speed and dissipation of shear and acoustic
waves, for low values of the Mach number. Nevertheless, deviations in the dissipation rate start
appearing for higher values. The latter are related to the famous O(Maâ€™) errors that are obtained
in the definition of the viscous stress tensor [42]. Hence, the LSA of the DVBE is able to capture
the weakly compressible deficiency of the D2Q9 velocity discretization, as previously reported
for the D3Q19 lattice [67]. In fact, previous studies showed that by adopting higher-order velocity
discretizations, the LSA further leads to shear and acoustic waves that do not suffer anymore
from compressibility errors [12,78].

If we now consider results obtained with methods that are supposed to restore the Galilean
invariance of standard lattices, such as the cascaded and the cumulant-based LBMs [18,19,26],
