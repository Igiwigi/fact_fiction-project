An iconic example of this is the
investigation of cholera in London conducted by John Snow
in 1854, which is now considered to be the first modern
epidemiological investigation [11]. Good descriptive epid-
emiology is extremely powerful for decision makers as it
can quickly guide the direction of an outbreak response. In
fact, in many instances, descriptive analysis alone is sufficient
for guiding disease control efforts in the early phase of an
outbreak and more sophisticated analysis sometimes only
provides marginal gains for decision makers, often because
the results are usually available too late to be operationally
relevant. Tools for visualization of public health data beyond the
traditional person, place and time epidemiological
