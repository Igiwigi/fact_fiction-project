Ass0c. 1851, pp. 280, 281. Tt amounts to 0”-065 in time; and as the
effect of this will in every observation appear to delay the arrival of the earth-waye at
the instrument, this constant in time, converted into distance, must be added to the rate
of wave-transit otherwisge obtained. The chronograph (originally devised by WHEATSTONE) is shown in fig. 1*, Plate XXTIT,
It consists, in fact, of a small and finely made clock, deprived of its pendulum, but pro»
vided with a snitable detent, shown more at large in fig. 4*, by which the action of the
weight upon it is kept always arrested, but can immediately be permitted to take place
in giving it motion, upon pressing the hand quickly upon the leyer g. The running down of the weight causes the anchor and pallets of the escapement (k)
rapidly to pass the teeth of the escapement-wheel (a), 80 that the clock * runs doyn”
by a succession of minute descents, and thus the motion is practically a uniform one. It
follows that as more weight is added this velocity becomes greater, and by such addition
the instrument may be made to measure more and more minute fractions of time.
