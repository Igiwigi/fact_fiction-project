The exceedingly violent motion of particles resulting from the sudden or extremely
rapid transformation of a solid or liquid explosive body into highly expanded gas or
vapour, must obyiously exert a force which operates upon a resisting body, in the
vicinity, in a manner precisely similar to the force applied by opposing a body in the

* In illustration of the effect of friction of particles of a mass against each other in determining the develop-
ment of an explosion, the following experiment may be quoted, A. yery porous pellet of a mixture of potassic
chlorate and amorphous phosphorus (carefully purified from ordinary phosphorus) was placed between two
polished metal plates, and a someyhat rapidly accumulating pressure was then applied ; the mass exploded

almost, directly, before, in fact, snflicient force had been expended to conyert the loose aggregate of particles
into a compact mass. A second similar pellet, also placed between two polished surfaces, was submitted to

prexaure very gradually and carefully applied, and was thus converted into a compact mass without being

exploded; on afterwards submitting this to rapidly increasing pressure precisely as in the first experiment, a

much more considerable accumulation of force was required to accomplish the explosion of the mass.
