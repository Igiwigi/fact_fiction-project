290. If by establishing two linear relations between the coefficients (7, u, v, w) the
equation A=0 can be satisfied (which in fact can be done by the solution of a quadrie
equation), then these quantities can be by means of the relations in question expreed |
as linear functions of any two of them, say of » and w; and then the next coefficient Y
will be a cubic function (v, w)*, and the equation B=0 will be satisfied by means of a
cubic equation (v, w)*=0, that is, the transformed equation in 2 can be by means of the
Solution of a quadric and a cubic equation reduced to the trinomial form

C D

and M. Henwite shows that the equation A=0 can be satisfied as aboye very simply, and
that in two different ways, viz.
