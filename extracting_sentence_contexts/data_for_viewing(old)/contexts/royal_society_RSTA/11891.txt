the apparatus was heated to about 350° C., and evacuated, and dried by passing
filtered air through it. When cool, the apparatus was evacuated as completely as
possible, and mercury was admitted by connecting a reservoir to each of the lower
taps in turn, until the level of the mercury rose nearly to the upper cross tubes.
The apparatus was again evacuated by connecting the pump to each of the upper

taps in turn, in order to remove any air displaced by the mercury. The filling was
then completed and the gauge tubes connected. The absence of air was shown by
the fact that, if the level on one side were disturbed by running mercury into or out
of the gauge, by means of the three-way taps g, *, and mereury reservoirs ¢, af

apparent on the other side of the gauge. If the level was raised about 1 cm. by

inserting a glass plunger, without withdrawing or adding mercury, the levels returned
to their previous values within 0°01 mm. in about a minute after the removal of the
plunger, in spite of the great length of fine tube through which the mercury had to
flow. If, on the other hand, the continuity of the mercury column was broken by a
single air bubble in one of the fine tubes, the level could be altered by a centimetre
