SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS. 379

and takes a little time in doing so, then it can be understood that its extension may be
limited by another leaf even if the latter is slightly younger. This suggested explanation is supported by the fact that in the two experiments of
this sub-group in which I, was symmetrical, Nos. 22 and 23, the anodic stipule of Lk
was especially large (see Table IV, column 3) and also especially thick (see fig. 15, No.
23). It therefore seems possible that in these two experiments this stipule extended
especially rapidly and so stopped the extension of I, sooner than in the other experi-
ments. Incidentally it may be noted that in several other experiments, both in the
