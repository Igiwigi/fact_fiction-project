Nematothallus is abundant and readily
demonstrated at Brecon Beacons Quarry and occurs at Llanover, Talybont and
Kemeys. Prototaxites also has been found in all these exposures. The most striking fact,
however, concerns the occurrence at Llanover not merely of fragments of Prototaxites
but of large specimens. It is not necessary to return here to the general question of
the possible terrestrial habitat of these plants, which was fully considered in relation
to the Downtonian flora (Lang 1937). It need only be pointed out that the presence
of Prototaxites in the Senni Beds affords strong additional support for regarding the
Nematophytales as land plants.
