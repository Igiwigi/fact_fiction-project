But in July there is a difference of 3*79, August 3%31,
= September 3:16, Madras being plus: then the sign changes and Bombay becomes
> plus for the remaining months of the year, and also in January. The coldest month
= in Bombay was January, and the hottest May. In Bombay, in 1843 and 1844, unlike
= Madras, there is an inversion in the decrement of heat on the sun's going south ; for
5 October is represented as hotter than September in both years: a very remarkable
2 fact is exhibited by these hourly means, namely, that neither the south-west mons00n
S at Bombay, nor the north-east monso0n at Madras, at all affect the monthly mean
E. regular increment or decrement of heat, with the exception of October in Bombay.
= It will be observed that the maximum heat, both at Madras and Bombay, was not
[5 when the sun was vertical at either place passing to the northern tropic ; but
<= when the sun was near to the northern tropic in June, the mean temperature in
5 1843 at Madras, in lat. 13? 4, was at its maximum in July, while at Bombay, in
E lat. 18* 55', the greatest heat was in May of that year ; and though the sun passes over
S both places again to the south the mean temperature gradually declines in each year,
= with the exceptions noticed. I was desirous of inserting in the Table of Mean Tem-
5 peratures those for 1843 and 1844 at Calcutta, for comparison with the Madras and
A Bombay observations for the same year; but on referring to the volumes of the

Bengal Asiatic Researches for 1843 and 1844, I found that the tables had not been
inserted. They were met with however in the Journal of the Horticultural Society
of Calcutta, but proved to be records of the temperature during the day only at
94 A.M., noon, 4 P.M. and sunset*.
