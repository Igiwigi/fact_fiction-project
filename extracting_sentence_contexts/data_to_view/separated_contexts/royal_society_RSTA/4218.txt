These rules, however, =
are not completely empirical, because (beyond the fact that no rules could even be completely 3
empirical) operational circuits are given a mathematical structure. This is parallel to Heisenberg’s
arrangement of the quantities he used into the square tables, matrices, which we now take for nee)
granted, but which, as explained earlier, was a mathematical invention that gave a structure, :
architecture to these quantities, ultimately linked to the probabilities of transitions between a]
stationary states. In fact, these quantities could even be seen in relation to circuits where these DN
quantities are observed or (probabilistically) predicted as spectra. Heisenberg, again, needs other [o
elements, just described, to establish this architecture fully, quite differently from how Chiribella, :B
D’Ariano and Perinotti aim to do this. Nevertheless, in this case, too, we still deal with the .
architecture, that of circuits, from which the mathematical architecture of the theory emerges.!7
We keep in mind that in both approaches we only deal with mathematical structures linked to and
providing the probabilities or statistics of the outcomes of discrete quantum experiments, thus in
accord with the QD and QP/QS principles, without providing any representation of quantum
processes themselves.
