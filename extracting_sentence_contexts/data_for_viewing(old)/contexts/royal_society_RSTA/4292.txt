In fact, in the present case there are precisely two solutions (Rj, a; ® nj) and (Ry, az ® ng) of (2.9), : ay
the twins are compound, i.e. there are two different twofold rotations relating the variants as 1B
above, and each solution can be considered of both types I and II. (See [28,29] and above.) In the : =
