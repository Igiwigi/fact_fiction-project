These curves have been drawn so as to lie evenly about the observational points. Theoretically, the
curves should be hyperbolas on the assumption of uniform movements of the clouds. They are in fact
very flat hyperbolas almost coinciding with the asymptotes,


ELECTRIC FIELD OF OVERHEAD THUNDERCLOUDS. 19 It will thus be clear that the thunder-lightning intervals generally support the con-
clusions made regarding the position and movements of the most active region of these
thunderclouds from a study of the electrograms, the charge records, and the pluviograms.
