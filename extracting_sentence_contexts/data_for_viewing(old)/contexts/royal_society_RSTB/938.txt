1% he form of smooth oval or spherical masses (Plate 34, fig. 2, C.s.), which are widely
iBferent both in refractive characters and in size, from the minute irregular particles
oered for ingestion. So striking is the contrast, and so constant is its occurrence
with this form of food, that I attempted to watch the process by which the spherical
festa are shaped: in this attempt I was struck by the clearness with which some
dBaracteristic features of the process are demonstrable in Carchesium, and realized
t the very act, with the performance of which I was especially concerned, was appa-
yently bound up with the operation of a mechanism undescribed in existing descrip-
ns of digestion in the Protozoa. This led me to record, in the paper which follows,
‘the result of sequent observation of the phenomena of ingestion, digestion, and ejec-
n in Carchesium; for, while the intracellular solution of food is as truly without
e cell substance as in the case of Amaba; while, indeed, there is no fundamental
fact established for the digestion of that animal which does not find a parallel here,
—the digestive cycle is shortened, unfamiliar details of the process are striking, and
€yen the more familiar events occur with a dramatic vividness which makes them
almost strange.

The animals I watched (Carchesium and Epistylis) were kept in hanging drops of
water, and were thus under no unusual pressure. Various solutions and suspended
