work in our group, in which we further control for con-
founding effects of age, gender, brain size and motion, as
well as using a leave-one-family-out cross-validation frame-
work (LOFO) instead of the original LOSO framework (thus
accounting for the family structure of the HCP dataset, see
Methods), further revised the effect size down to about
rLoro = 0.09 using methods matched as closely as possible
to the original study [46]; yet using improvements including
better inter-subject alignment and multivariate modelling,
we found rjoro = 0.263 (N = 884) [49]. Note that this
effect size is comparable to recent estimates of the relation-
ship between brain size and intelligence [50]. Though the
explained variance is small, it would, in fact, fall around
the 65th percentile of correlations observed in individual-
differences research [51] (with the caveat that ryoro
correlation is derived from a cross-validation procedure,
which breaks the assumption of independence between
individual data points).

According to recent guidelines [52], the assessment of gen-
eral intelligence with HCP’s 24-item Progressive Matrices
would be considered of ‘fair’ quality (one test, one cognitive
dimension, testing time less than 19min), and would be
expected to correlate with general intelligence in the range
0.50-0.71. This rather low measurement quality itself is
