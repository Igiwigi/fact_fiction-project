Cilia. Those curious isolated patches ot stiff cilia constituting the “ciliated discs” have
already been referred to (p. 154). Asa general rule they project slightly from the
anterior and posterior sides of the filament, owing to the fact that the columnar cells
bearing them are taller than the ordinary epithelial cells, e.g., Lithodomus dactylus
(fig. 3A). In certain instances, however, they are set upon definite outgrowths or
“spurs” of the filament, arising from the anterior and posterior sides, e.g., Modiola
polita (fig. 3B), or from the interlamellar edge, e.g., Spondylus nicobaricus (fig. 3C). The other cilia of the filaments are usually arranged in vertical strips or bands,
one down the frontal surtace of the filament—the frontal cilia—and one on each of
the sides of the filament—the /ateral cilia—separated from the frontal cilia by a
narrow space.
