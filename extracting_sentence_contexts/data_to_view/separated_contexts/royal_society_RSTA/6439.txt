And as the
yapers assembled here show, there are still many issues about which individual
scientists do not yet agree, ranging from exactly how to measure sea-level
accurately, to the drivers and causes of the current rates of increase. But we need

o ensure that these inevitable scientific challenges are not misinterpreted by the

nay-sayers of this world. Nobody who took part in the meeting is saying that sea-
evels are not rising, driven in significant part by human action (just as virtually
no serious scientist disagrees with the fact that smoking is a significant cause of
ung cancer). The disagreements are about more subtle problems. In our search
or scientific excellence, we must not lose sight of this simple and important
message.
