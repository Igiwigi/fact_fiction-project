P {a = x < b|B} <1. It is obvious that the above two properties are equivalent to the definition of a
random variable. In fact, if x has the properties (a) that whatever a <b the
definition of the fundamental probability set (A) allows the calculation of the
probability P {a = x < 5}, and (6) that there are such properties B and such numbers
a <b that 0 < P {a = x < 4|B} < 1, then x is a random variable in the sense of the
above definition. The probability P {a = x < }} considered as a function of a and 4 will be called
the integral probability law of x. A random variable is here contrasted with a constant, say 0, which will be defined
as a magnitude, the numerical values of which corresponding to all elements of the

set (A) are all equal.
