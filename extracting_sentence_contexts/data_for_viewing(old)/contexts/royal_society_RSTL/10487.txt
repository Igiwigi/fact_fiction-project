where 7 is the absolute temperature, calculated on the assumption that the molecules
contain all the heat disengaged in the reaction, and a is the mean density of the gases
remaining after combustion.

The rate of explosion and the calculated velocity of the gaseous molecules agree
fairly well in the case of hydrogen and the simpler hydrocarbons exploded with
oxygen. For instance, they find the velocity of explosion of electrolytic gas to be
2810 metres per second, the * theoretical velocity” being 2831 metres per second.
But with carbonic oxide the velocity observed is only 1090 metres per second, the
calculated velocity being 1940. This gas they consider, therefore, to be an exception
to the general rule. When, however, a mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen is
exploded with oxygen, they find the observed velocity of explosion to approximate to
the calculated velocity, and explain the fact by supposing the hydrogen to com-
municate to the carbonic oxide a law of detonation analogous to its own. With
mixtures of carbonic oxide and nitrous oxide, a similar divergence between the cal-
; culated and observed velocities of explosion is found, whereas with hydrogen and
other gases containing hydrogen, exploded with nitrous oxide, there is a very close
agreement between the observed and calculated velocities. BERTHELOT and ViEILE
dried the explosion tube before each experiment, and employed dry gases. In their
experiments with hydrogen and oxygen they found that the rate of the explosive
wave was independent of the material of the tube, and of its diameter above 5 millims,
The velocity was the same whether the tube was curved or straight, The maximum

velocity was attained only after the explosion had travelled between 50 and 500
 millims. from the spark. The © variable state” preceding the regime of the explosive
