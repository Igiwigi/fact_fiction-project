variation within each of them. In fact, it may be said that after reaching puberty the
weight of the testes bears little relation to their state of activity. Considering now the testis weight when compared with that of the other organs of
the genitalia, we find that a diagram similar to that of fig. 17 is shown in fig. 18, where
the testis weight is plotted against the weight of the penis. The ratio thus demonstrated
shows that the weight of the penis is fairly closely correlated with the general increase in
body size as the animal grows up.
