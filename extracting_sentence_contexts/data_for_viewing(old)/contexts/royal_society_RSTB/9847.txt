others [12].

This minimal definition allows us to examine both the
extent to which empathy and its potential outcomes (such
as helping or comforting) are present across species, and
the neurobiobehavioural mechanisms that support its oper-
ation in human and non-human animals. Thus, we do not
see the utility of defining empathy as an overarching category
containing all associated concepts such as emotional conta-
gion, imitation, sympathy and compassion. Naturally, in
humans, empathy can be activated in a variety of different
ways. It can be elicited by controlled cognitive processes
like those activated by imagination or reading fiction.
Theory of mind, language and executive functions do greatly
expand the range of cognitions and behaviours that can be
driven by empathy [13]. In this paper, we focus on empirical
findings from studies with humans and non-human animals
that demonstrate common proximate biological mechanisms
underlie the reactions to, and processing of, the distress
cues of conspecifics, as a paradigmatic case for empathy
across species.
