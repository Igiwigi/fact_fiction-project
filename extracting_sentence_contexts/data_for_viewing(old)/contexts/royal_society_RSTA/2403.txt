and b=u+a.

Again, we fix ¢ =0.05, a=0.5. Also we choose o = 0.4 as in figure 3. If we start with t =0 and
then increase t, at some point the neuron (u(t), v(t)) starts to follow the virtual delayed neuron
(u(t — t), v(t — T)) on the limit cycle, whereas the limit cycle itself becomes smaller. This effect is
shown in figure 5a. Note that in [101] a similar model is studied, but it is operated in the excitable
regime (a > 1), and the analysis is performed for small delay t = O(¢).

The fact that the delayed neuron is slightly ahead of the real neuron means that the difference
h=T —t between period T and delay t is small. When the system is on a stable limit cycle,
u(t) =u(t+T). This means that u(t — t)=u(t+T — t) =u(t+h). Considering small h, we can
approximate u(t + h) ~ u(t) + hu(t). Then the dynamic equations become
