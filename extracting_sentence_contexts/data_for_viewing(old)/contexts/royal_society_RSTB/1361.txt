ii the same relationship to these as do the fibres in the posterior longitudinal
biadle and raphé to the anterior and antero-lateral columns. It is possible that in
the cat and the dog this higher “ internuncial” or segmental system is more marked
fan in the monkey or in man, just as in the latter examples, the pyramidal system
isfar more extensive than in the former.
SThe Pyramidal Tracts.—The fibres of one pyramid alone are found degenerate
ager removal of the whole motor area or the whole hemisphere ; no fibres therefore
Hass by the corpus callosum, as has been suggested by Hamitron,* into the opposite
WBramid. At the decussation the fibres cross to the opposite side, and no direct
Pyramidal tract is left behind. A few fibres of the pyramid at the lower level of the
ussation instead of crossing to the opposite side may curve round in the form of a
fgnall bundle to enter the crossed pyramidal tract of its own side. Corresponding
#ith this fact, a very few degenerate fibres may be observed in the crossed pyramidal
Bact on the same side as the lesion.
© Laneuey,t in summing up the various observations upon descending degenerations,
ates that in no case apparently did unilateral brain injury cause degeneration of the
@pposite pyramid, although, in the cord, both crossed tracts might be degenerate.
Since then little evidence has been brought forward to show that the opposite
pyramid may degenerate after unilateral cortical injury. Hamirron, loc. cit., believes
that fibres may enter the opposite pyramid by way of the corpus callosum, and
Scnirert appears to have held a similar view. In reviewing the numerous
Observations which have been made upon the descending degeneration following
