The expansions were taken at various temperatures up to 90° C., and after each
observation the distance between the microscopes was checked by wheeling the
standard metre beneath them. This precaution was necessary in order to see that
the heat did not warp the stands and thus alter the positions of the microscopes, but
only in a few cases was it necessary to apply a correction on this account.

The coefficients of expansion of all the wires used in the rigidity experiments were
determined, with the exception of the very soft metals lead, cadmium, and tin, which
were found to draw out slightly under the necessary tension, especially at the higher
temperatures. The coefficients of expansion of these metals would have to be found
from bars of the material, but in the present research it was not necessary to know
them with great accuracy on account of the fact that the rigidity determinations in
these cases were not so accurate as with the harder wires. The values given in
Lurpron’s tables (1901) were therefore used.

Before determining the coefticients of expansion, the wires—which had been bent
into spirals for weighing in air and water in the determination of their radii—were
straightened and annealed in the same manner as before the determination of their
rigidities,

The lengths of the wires at the different temperatures were plotted against the
