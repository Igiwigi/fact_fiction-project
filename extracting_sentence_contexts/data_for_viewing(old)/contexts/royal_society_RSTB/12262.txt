larva signs of precocious metamorphosis could be provoked by

: blocking the JH signal at the third larval instar [22,34]. The
two youngest instars in both species appear to lack compe-
tence to metamorphose and hence not to rely on JH to
safeguard their larval status. Using epidermal implantation
assays in Bombyx, Inui & Daimon [60] have recently demon-
strated that the absence of JH or its receptor Met1 is in fact
required, but not sufficient, to trigger premature develop-
ment already in the first-instar larva. This early JH role in
