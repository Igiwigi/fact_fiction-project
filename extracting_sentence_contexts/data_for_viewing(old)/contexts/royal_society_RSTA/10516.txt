hand, 1891 to 1894, the years in which the non-cyclic effect has its largest positive
values, were years in which sun-spots were either very numerous or increasing rapidly
in number. Thus I think that whilst it would be unwise to dogmatise as to the cause
of the apparent non-cyclic effect in D, the evidence distinctly points to the conclusion
that it is a true magnetic phenomenon which varies, however, with the season of the
year, and with the position of the year in the sun-spot cycle.

ยง 16. In the case of I (see Table VI.), the non-cyclic effect is evidently no chance
phenomenon. The means for every year of the eleven, and for every month of the
twelve, alike come out negative, and the preponderance of individual months in which
the effect is negative is overwhelming. The true secular change is here in the same
direction as the apparent non-cyclic effect, and so tends to increase it, but only to an
insignificant extent. In fact it requires only 10 average quiet days to bring about a
decrease in I equal to the secular change observed in an entire year.

The absolute magnitude of the non-cyclic change in I, as we see from Table X.,
does not vary very conspicuously with the season of the year, but relative to the
range of the diurnal inequality it is most important in winter. In January, in fact, it
averaged fully 30 per cent. of the range of the proper cyclic diurnal variation.

ยง 17. The non-cyclic effect in H, see Table VII:, is as prominent as in I. Here also
it is increased by the contribution from the secular change, but 8 average quiet days
suffice to produce an increment in the force equal to the full secular change for the
year. The non-cyclic effect in H is on the whole wonderfully uniform throughout
the year, but it appears somewhat reduced at midsummer. Relative to the range
