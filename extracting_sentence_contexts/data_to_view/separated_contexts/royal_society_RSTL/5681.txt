I have, moreover, placed
pieces of ice together over night and found them in the morning 80 rigidly frozen toge-
ther, that when I sought to separate them, the surface of fracture passed through one of
them in preference to taking the surface of regelation. Many sagacious persons have
also suggested to me that the ice transported to this country from Norway and the
Wenham Lake may possibly retain a residue of its cold, sufficient to freeze a thin film
enclosed between two pieces of the substance. But the facts already adverted to are a
sufficient reply to this surmise. The ice experimented on cannot be regarded as a
magazine of cold, because parcels of liquid water exist within it.

44. Nevertheless, as our present knowledge of the facility with which ice permits

* 16 is here implied that the contact of the moist surfaces must be 80 perfect, or in other words, the
liquid film between them must be 80 thin, as to enable the molecules to act upon each other across it.
