future observers to discover them, but the possibility of the gynzcoid worker-like
forms subserving the same function should not be overlooked.


1380 DR. A. D. IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS.

F. Inrestinat Prorozoa, wira Descriptions or New SPpEctres.

Living within the lumen of the posterior intestine of Archotermopsis is to be found
an abundant Protozoan fauna. It occurs principally in the older larva, soldiers,
nymphs, and worker-like individuals, less abundantly in the younger larvee, and only
occasionally and scantily in the winged reproductive forms. Whenever the Protozoa
are present, evidence thereof can be detected by the fact that the contents ef this
portion of the digestive system appears brown to the unaided eye. The large
intestine is greatly enlarged and distended (Plate 10, fig. 62), in order to harbour the
truly enormous fauna which it contains. It is noteworthy that no special sac-like
outgrowth of the gut is present for the reception of these organisms, such as is found
among certain other Termitidee. If a small drop of this brown, turbid contents of the
intestine be transferred to a slide, and examined in normal saline solution under the
microscope, a truly remarkable spectacle greets the eye. It is seen to consist almost
entirely of vast numbers of actively moving Protozoa, only an insignificant quantity
of ligneous or other material being present. The fauna is, on the whole, richest in
numbers of species and individuals in the worker-like forms. 4

For the purpose of investigating these organisms, both fresh and stained prepara-
