Sidered in order to form a correct decision.

I would however obsecrve, that in ship-building alone, it appears from the facts
already recorded, that iron is very superior in its powers of resistance to strain ; it is
highly ductile in its character, and easily moulded into any required form without
impairing its strength. It is also stronger in combination than timber, arising from
the nature of the construction, and the materials composing the iron ship become
a homogeneous mass when united together, forming as it were a s0lid, without
Joints, and presenting as a whole the most formidable powers of resistance*. These
are some of the properties which appear to distinguish iron from other materials, and
which give it an ascendency of combined action, which cannot be obtained in the
union of timber however ingeniously contrived. It moreover possesses the property
of lightness along with strength ; in fact, its buoyancy, strength and durability con-
stitute the elements of its utility in the innumerable cases to which it may be applied.
In ship-building it possesses other advantages over timber. Its hull is free from the

* Since the above was written we have had many examples of the enormous strength of iron ships, and
amongst others we may instance an iron vessel which took the ground with nearly one-half of her length at the
stern hanging over a shelf for a whole tide; another, the Vanguard iron steamer, which for several hours
(under the action of a heavy surf) was beating upon sharp shelving rocks without going to pieces; and lastly,

the Great Britain steam-ship, which was stranded in Dundrum Bay, and resisted the force of the winter storms
for many months.
