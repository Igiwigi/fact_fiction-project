This is somewhat in contradiction to
California habitats can select optimal areas with low previous studies that found that mountain lions avoided any
human disturbance. This variation within a population influ- road type in California [20]. However, these approaches to

ences individual strategies and fitness that are crucial for major roads (with cars moving at high speed, rarely stopping)


during the night could also be influenced by the fact that deer
use road verges when vehicle activity is lower [16], poten-
tially due to a ‘human shield’ effect [80]. Furthermore,
studies on other predators in the study area found that high-
ways acted as home range boundaries on territorial
individuals, with residents regularly patrolling infrastructure
rights-of-way during their periods of activity [81]. Finally, we acknowledge several caveats associated with
our study that are important to consider.
