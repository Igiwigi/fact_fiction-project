He connected the intrinsic
and extrinsic characters of minerals, in the Indez Fossilium,
which he published in 1772. In Sweden, BErRG@MaAN's treatise on
the forms: of crystals, published in the Upsal Transactions, in
1779, was a more authoritative recommendation to the inyes-
tigation of the principles of crystallization; and it can be of
little importance for me to add, that since I have possessed
the collection of Baron Born, in 1773, I have had every con-
firmation of the same opinion. The progress of chemistry and
of crystallography, applied to mineralogy, has rendered the exa-
mination of strata, and of mines, a source of amusement as
well as instruction ; and the arrangement of interesting facts,
in the chemistry and mechanism. of nature, suits my occasional
researches in geology, which, from variety of avocations and cir-
cumstances, have been very much interrupted. My acknowledg-
ment of obligation to the learned who have made this progress
in science, is the best recommendation I can give to others to
examine their works.
