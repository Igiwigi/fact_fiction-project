Note on the hydrolysis of the acetyl compound of A.—The non-volatile product from
the hydrolysis of the acetyl product of A consists of a whitish solid residue with a
melting point of 165°-167° C. A mixed melting point of this and product B gave
168°-170° C. Apparently the process of acetylation and deacetylation of Product A
causes racemisation of the optically active compound, a fact which confirms the view
expressed on p. 284 that Products A and B are optical isomerides.
