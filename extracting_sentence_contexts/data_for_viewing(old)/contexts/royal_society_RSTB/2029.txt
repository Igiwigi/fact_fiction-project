If, however, the bulb has been preserved in alcohol, the cells present a different
appearance. What in the living cell was occupied mainly by liquid, is now solid,
making the tissue quite hard to cut and friable to the touch. The cell is almost
filled with a nearly hyaline mass, in which the starch grains are embedded. The
nucleus of the cell can easily be rendered visible by staining, and is not enclosed in

the mass, but is either clinging to it, or to the cell-wall. This solid precipitate in
the cell is, in fact, the inulin, which in the fresh scale remains dissolved in the cell-
sap; on the penetration of the alcohol it is precipitated and takes the form of the
cell, in which it is held, enclosing the starch-grains. These casts can easily be
liberated from the walls surrounding them, and can be seen under the microscope
floating about as isolated masses, holding the starch-grains. If a starch-grain be
freed from a cast, then a circular depression remains in it, showing where it was
retained.

These inulin masses are not confined to any special part, but, like the starch, oceur
throughout the parenchymatous tissue of the scale. They are insoluble in cold water
and glycerine, so sections exhibiting them can be mounted permanently in dilute
glycerine (see Plate 3 for figures).
