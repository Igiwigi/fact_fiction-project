The 2015 eclipse provided a further opportunity to investigate the decay of the Earth’s
ionosphere, although this time the focus of the experiment was to compare the observed
ionospheric changes with artificial eclipses created using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) [6] in order to determine whether it is possible to detect the obscuration of active regions
within the solar corona by observing simultaneous changes to the rate of decay of charge in the
Earth’s ionosphere.

Routine ionospheric soundings have been made in the UK since 20 September 1932, initially
at the Radio Research Station at Ditton Park near Slough and subsequently at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in Chilton, Oxfordshire, UK [7]. Short-wave (1 MHz to approx. 20 MHz)
radio pulses are transmitted and received at the same location. These measurements exploit the
fact that the resonant frequency of ionospheric electrons (f, Hz) is proportional to the square-root
of the electron concentration (N, m~?) with the relation f ~9,/N. A radio signal is returned from
the ionosphere when the frequency of the radio pulse matches the resonant frequency of the local
electrons. Since the density of ionization varies with height due to the relative extent with which
solar radiation over the EUV and X-ray spectrum can penetrate the atmosphere, a height profile
of ionization can be built up by transmitting short-wave radio pulses over a range of frequencies
corresponding to the range of ionospheric resonant frequencies. The data are displayed as plots
of time of flight against radio frequency known as ionograms. By assuming that the radio pulses
travel at the speed of light in free space, the height can be estimated from the time of flight.
These ‘virtual heights’ are overestimates for all but the lowest frequencies, however, since the
atmosphere is weakly ionized, slowing the speed of the signal due to its resonance with the local
