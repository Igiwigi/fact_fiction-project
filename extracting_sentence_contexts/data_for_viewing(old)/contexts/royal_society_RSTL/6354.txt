21. I remark, with respect to the equation in 0, for the cubic, that it leads at once to
the equation of differences. In fact we have

whence changing the sign of 0,
&f+9ac—P)1—v/ E270 =I,{0+(—P)} ;
or multiplying the two equations and putting for &,
u{aub+Nac—B)}*+270 =IL,{u—(4«—BY},
that is, the equation of differences is
