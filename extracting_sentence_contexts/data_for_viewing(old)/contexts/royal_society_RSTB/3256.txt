more convex. In this case the pressure in the water between E and F will be
less than the pressure in the air-bubble between F and G by the difference between
the surface tension pressures exercised by the menisci at the levels E and F,
assuming that the same ratio holds good for the points E and F, G and H (fig. 1, D).
The fact that the surface tension of a liquid may be raised by the presence of
dissolved substances in it in accordance with their osmotic value gave rise to the
suggestion that co-ordinated variations of surface tension, produced by the excretion
and reabsorption of sugar and other substances from the medullary ray cells, under
the stimulus of the gaseous diffusion from the air-bubbles, might induce an upward
flow of water, or at least reduce the resistance to onward flow. Although the
possibility of the existence of such actions in the wood vessels cannot be denied,
attempts to demonstrate their connection with the upward flow of sap have not met
with any success, and, in fact, the most active excretion of sugar into the vessels
usually occurs in spring, when they are filled, or nearly filled, with sap, so that at
most only an osmotic action can be exercised.

There are, however, other ways in which a movement of water columns in the
vessels can be produced by influences radiating from the medullary rays. The
capillary depression or elevation of a liquid in a tube is directly proportional to
the cosine of the angle of contact and to the surface tension of the liquid, and is
inversely proportional to the radius of the tube and the density. of the liquid.
If the angle of contact is less than 90°, the meniscus is concave and the liquid is
raised ; if greater than 90° it is depressed. The angle of contact depends upon the
material of the wall and of the liquid, and is not the same with air above mercury
in glass as with water above mercury, nor is the surface tension the same. Water
