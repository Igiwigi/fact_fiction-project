SOME MARINE PLANKTON DIATOMS 37

At first I was tempted to regard this process as a regulation of the cell diameter
independent of auxospores.* The rigid girdle being broken the cell could expand and
form a new and broader girdle and valve. But, as mentioned before, on the whole
the diameter of the cells of successive cultures showed a steady decrease. Thus, should
that phenomenon in fact represent a secondary growth, it might have slowed down
the rate of decrease of the size in the population but did not prevent it altogether. C. radiatus Eur. has been cultured since 23 September 1935, when two cells were
isolated from a plankton sample. In February the average diameter of the cells was
1104, in August 694.
