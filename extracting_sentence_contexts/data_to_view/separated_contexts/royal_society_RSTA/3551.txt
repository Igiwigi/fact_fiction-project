The study shows that the conversion can be done on a regional level
over the summer period with low-cost changes to appliances. While there is a precedent for
such a transition programme in the UK, with the conversion of town gas (a mixture of 50%
hydrogen with methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide) to natural gas in the 1960s and 1970s,
todayâ€™s gas network is far more complex and requires the collaboration of government, different
gas providers, local authorities and customers. In fact, customer acceptance of a new heating
technology is very important and could be a significant barrier when changes are required. Natural gas is widely used in many developed (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development) countries. For example, in the UK and the Netherlands gas boilers are used in 80%
of houses [35], and studies in the UK show a strong customer preference for using gas boilers,
which are perceived as safer, cheaper, more effective and easy to control than their alternatives
[60,61].
