charge whose value, as has already been pointed out, depended upon the pressure
of the air in the chamber B. As, then, no leak from the electrode occurred when
the aluminium was ‘04 millim. in thickness, it seems justifiable to conclude that if any
Réntgen rays were present under these circumstances they were of an extremely
weak character. If Réntgen rays of even very moderate intensity had entered the
chamber, a leak would have taken place which could have been observed. In practice
the aluminium foil used in my experiments was about ‘008 millim. in thickness, and
with this foil intense ionization was observed. From the known character of Réntgen
rays, it was quite impossible for this great ionization to be produced by rays which
could be absorbed by a layer of aluminium ‘032 millim.—the difference in thickness
of the two windows.

Again, an ordinary focus tube illustrates very well the fact that the Réntgen
rays produced issue in a large measure from the face of the anticathode, upon
which the cathode rays fall, while the radiation appearing to come from the opposite
face is always very weak. The theory now generally accepted is that the Réntgen
rays are electromagnetic pulses sent through the ether when the moving electrified
particles which constitute the cathode rays are suddenly stopped. If then the
Réntgen radiation sent out in the direction of propagation of the cathode rays, when
these carriers were stopped by foil ‘04 millim. in thickness, was at most but very
feeble, it appears highly improbable that a strong radiation of this kind could be
produced by those carriers that passed through the thinner foil without being
stopped.

The conductivity produced in a gas by cathode rays is, moreover, far in excess of
