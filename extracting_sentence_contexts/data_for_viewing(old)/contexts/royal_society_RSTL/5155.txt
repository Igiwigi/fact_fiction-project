existed.

The Sympathetic System*.â€”This exists, and is more or less demonstrable, in the
skin, the buccal mass, and in all the internal organs. It consists of a vast number
of minute distinct ganglia, varying in size and form, the larger quite visible to the
naked eye, of a bright orange colonr like the ganglia round the cesophagus, and
interconnected by numerous delicate white nervous filaments, arranged in more or
less open plexuses or networks. This beantiful system is in several points, as already
indicated, connected with both sers of cesophageal ganglia.

In the skin the sympathetic system is not very easily detected, nor indeed have
we much songht for it there; but we have seen enough to prove its presence in the
fact of the existence of two or three ganglia in connection with filaments of the
anterior branches of the branchial ganglion.

In the buccal mass this system is only a little more evident, and is very difficult
of investigation ; we have, however, sncceeded in making out a few ganglia and nerves
in the neighbourhood of the cesophagus. First, there is a nerve on the poxsterior
surface of the buccal mass passing forward on each side of the infra-cesophageal
ganglia, and having itself a small ganglion with other nerves at each of its ends im-
bedded in the buccal mass. This nerve runs within the second collar, communicating
with it, and giving a twig to the salivary gland ; it also furnishes a twig which joins
the lingual nerve. This nerve is probably the rudimentary representative of that
large nerve in Zolis, which passing from the same part of the buccal mass runs also
within the corresponding collar with which it is in connection, and is distributed to
