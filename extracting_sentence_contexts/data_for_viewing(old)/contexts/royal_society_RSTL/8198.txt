the plants which M. BronGNlaRT has separated 80 widely, and to show that the transition
from one form to another is 80 gradual as to necessitate the inclusion of the entire
series in the Lepidodendroid family.

198 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

That the Sigillarie were Lepidodendroid is a conclusion that has been already arrived
at, first by Dr. Hooker and afterwards by Mr. BINNEY and Mr. CARRUTHERS ; but the
facts upon which this conclusion was based by these writers appear to me insufficient to
furnish a demonstration of this affinity, since no example of a true Sigillarig in which
the internal structure is preserved appears to have been hitherto described. Mr. Bixxgy
has described some plants* which he believes to be true Sagillarie ; but I agree with
Mr. CarrvTHERs, who has pointed out that one of thesef is a true Lepidodendron.
Another, is a very curious and distinct plant of which I haye sections, but which I
have, as yet, failed to interpret ; whilst the remaining plates refer to a plant which L
$hall notice further in this memoir, and which may be a Sigillaria; but I fear that we
have not as yet, sufficient evidence to render justifiable the conclusion that it is 80.
Mr. CarruTHERs informs me that since his several memoirs referring to this subject
were published, he has obtained such a Sigillaria, which he is about to describe; but
not having seen the specimen I am unable to form any opinion respecting it.
