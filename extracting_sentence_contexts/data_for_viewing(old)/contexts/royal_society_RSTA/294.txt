with 1 being the Hill coefficient (a measure of cooperativity) and [Xo] being the half-saturation
concentration. The hyperbola (2.6) (with n = 1) and the sigmoid (2.10) (with n =2) can both be
parametrized in this way (figure 2c). These parameters, among many others, are required to
provide a detailed biochemical description of any genetic network.

3. Genetic networks

(a) The network equation

Single genes are often regulated by multiple transcription factors that interact with one another.
A classic example is the lac operon, which is regulated by both a repressor and an activator [20].
In eukaryotes, a single gene could be regulated by dozens of proteins. It is a remarkable fact that,
using only thermodynamic constraints of the type we have considered, a promoter can be made to
perform a variety of mathematical operations on its regulatory inputs. Specifically, the probability
of occurrence of the transcriptionally active promoter configuration can be a complicated function
of the concentration of various transcription factors [21-26]. These concentrations can themselves
change over time owing to regulation of the genes encoding the transcription factors. If we wish
to understand the behaviour of the system, we must therefore consider the regulatory network as
a whole. We now try to arrive at a general mathematical description of such networks.

The rate of protein creation per promoter, a, is a product of the following terms: the probability
that the promoter is transcriptionally active, the rate at which transcription proceeds irreversibly
from the active state and the number of proteins translated per resulting transcript. Consider a
cell that contains np copies of a gene encoding protein Xi. If the protein once created does not
