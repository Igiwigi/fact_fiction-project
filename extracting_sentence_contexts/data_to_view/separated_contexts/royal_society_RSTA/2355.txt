An exponential fit to the X-ray data calculated a time constant of t=9810 s
and is therefore consistent with the dielectric measurements [40]. The timescales at the other
temperatures are difficult to compare, because here measurements at times longer than t > 104
s were not conducted, and both eHDA samples at 119 and 121K did not fully transform to
LDA within that time frame. Slight deviations can have different reasons, as thermal contact
or simply the fact that all X-ray measurements on these samples have been done at the same
sample position. Additionally, we demonstrated that these powder-samples exhibit macroscopic
heterogeneities and different points within the sample can transform on a slightly different
timescale. The different crystallization behaviour of LDA-I and LDA-II was investigated previously
in the literature.
