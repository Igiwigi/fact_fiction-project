It may be a question how far a similar septation may be accountable
for the origin in the first instance of a sorus with a plurality of sporangia united
together, as in Asterotheca, though I think this not improbably the mode of their
origin. I am disposed to regard such synangial types as being probably the more
primitive, and to think that a progressive separation of the individual sporangia has
led from these to such a type as Angiopteris or Hawlea. This view is at least
consistent with the facts, so far as 1 understand them, though it is not put forward
as in any way demonstrated. A full discussion of this matter will, however, be
deferred for the present ; it will find its best place when the Leptosporangiate ferns
have been examined, and it is to them that the next part of these Studies will be
largely devoted, while it will also include a discussion of the morphology of the
spore-producing members of Pteridophytes at large. Certain of the facts brought forward in this Memoir have a general bearing.
