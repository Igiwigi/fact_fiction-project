The word chiral was introduced by Kelvin to refer
to any geometrical figure or group of points that
cannot be brought into coincidence with its mirror
image, thus possessing a sense of handedness [1]. It derives, in fact, from the Greek for hand: yxeip
(E. Eleftheriadou 2015, private communication). In the
language of point group theory, a chiral form is devoid
of improper rotational symmetry elements [2].
