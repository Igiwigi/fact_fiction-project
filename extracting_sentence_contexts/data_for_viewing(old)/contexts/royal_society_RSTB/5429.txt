open some of the stems, larve of the fly were found surrounded by the débris of the
destroyed tissues, and in this material a few nematodes were discovered which attracted
the writer’s attention because they appeared Tylenchus-like and yet could not be
identified with any of the plant-parasitic or free-living Tylenchus species known to the
writer. ;

Most of them were in an ensheathed condition, but one or two fully developed males
were found having caudal ale but lacking any recognisable buccal stylet. The appear-
ance of the ensheathed forms called to mind certain figures by WULKER (10), p. 410,
illustrating the development of Allantonema mirabile, a nematode parasite of the pine
weevil, Hylobius abietis, and the view was tentatively formed that the newly-found
worms were in some way connected with the frit-fly, possibly as parasites of it. This
view received support from the fact that none of them were observed in dissections of
healthy stems, although specimens of certain free-living nematodes were found in these.

Several more affected stems were opened up and from many, but not all, of them the
new worms were obtained. By June 5 it was clear that the male worms always lacked
a mouth stylet, whilst the females were provided with a comparatively massive one.
The females also were found to have the uterus crowded with very small spermatozoa,
a feature in which they resembled the young spermatised females of Allantonema
described by WULKER.

This fact further confirmed the view, which by now had become fully formed, that
the worms would turn out to be parasitic in the frit-fly. Proof that this provisional
hypothesis was well founded was obtained on June 11, when a frit-fly larva, previously
