as a proximate elementary angle of the group.


MR. H. J. BROOKE ON THE GEOMETRICAL ISOMORPHISM OF CRYSTALS. 39

A guide to this selection presents itself in the crystals of Apophyllite, the angles of
which scarcely differ from those of a cube, and therefore admit an elementary angle of
exactly 45, which angle has been assumed as a variable type of the elementary angles
throughout the system.

Whether this angle of 45* is accidental, or is the effect of any at present unknown
relation between the cube and the square prism, the writer is not aware. But it is a
rather curious fact that there should also be in the rhombohedral system a series of
elementary angles of about 55Â®, not differing much from angles between two correspond-
ing faces of a cube.

On referring to Table P 1 (Plate II.), it will be scen that the crystals of Somervillite,
Fanyyasite and Romeine are represented by single faces only, to each of which the symbol
101 has been hitherto applied. But as the occurrence of only those particular faces on
the three crystals must be regarded as purely accidental, there is no reason for applying
that particular symbol to either of them, And as the symbols of faces are not in any
manner indicated by the faces themselves, we are at liberty to assign to those or to any
other faces any symbols which are consistent with the geometrical relations of the faces
in question. And hence have arisen some of the differences of symbols shown in the
Tables P 1 and P 2 (Plates II. and IIT.).
