(cf. figure 2) are not form-invariant under coordinate transformations, at least not for the elasticity

tensors of ordinary materials [40-42]. Here, c =C(r) is the elasticity tensor and p = p(r) the
local mass density. Intuitively, this finding is related to the fact that general mechanical waves
in three dimensions can have three different polarizations, namely two transverse and one
longitudinal polarization. By contrast, one usually only has two transverse polarizations of
electromagnetic waves (and even scalar quantities in thermodynamics). The elastic equations
are not even form-invariant in the static case [40].
