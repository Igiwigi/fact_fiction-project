Those
who hold to the belief that the Gymnosperms, or a part of them, sprang from
Lycopods, may find in the discovery of Lepidocarpon some support for their views. In spite of its seed-like organ, however, the new genus was a true Lycopod, and
shows no indication of transition to any other group. The mere fact that these
plants produced a reproductive body agreeing in many respects with a true seed, is
no proof that they belonged to the line of descent of any of the known types
of seed-bearing plants. Lepidocarpon is of great interest as demonstrating to us
one way in which seeds may have originated, but we have no right to assume that
it presents to us the actual origin of the seeds of Phanerogams. To take an
analogous case: Bennettites affords the earliest known instance of an angiospermous
fructification ; yet botanists are agreed that it has no affinity with the Class
Angiosperme.
