Platinum
Wire is so variable in its qualities that it is not safe to assume that the physical
groperties of different portions of the same hank even are the same.t
@ The standardizing of the thermo-junction is performed with the circuit precisely as
“at is to be used during the radiation experiments, with every joint soldered, and with
ghe field of force of the galvanometer suitably adjusted and rendered unchangeable,
"gs described above. Along with the thermo-electric wires, the leads, and the galvano-
-queter, a platinoid resistance of about 12 ohms was introduced into the cireuit. The
Gensitiveness of the arrangement was quite sufficient to permit of this being done ; and
“at was of great advantage to introduce this added resistance, as it rendered insensible
mall variations of resistance (due to temperature) in the long platinum thermo-
Blectric wire, which in early experiments gave rise to curious and embarrassing
~Fariations in the galvanometer readings.
3 From the standardizing, or calibration, as it is often called, of the thermo-electric
ireuit in use, a formula is obtained, from which is calculated, from the “ corrected
&leflection ”{ of the galvanometer, the difference of temperatures of the two junctions
terms of centigrade temperatures on the air thermometer.§ Every temperature

* The material used by chemists for making diachylon sticking plaster answers admirably.

+ The best makers will not, I believe, guarantee to supply wniform platinum, in the physical sense of
the word uniform, knowing that it cannot be done, at present at all events.

+ The deflection is read off on a plane seale, and is corrected for the fact that the angle turned through
by the light ray is twice the angle of deflection of the magnet and mirror. In order to apply this
correction with facility, a table of numbers was constructed. The correction may now, however, be
easily applied by the use of the recently published “ Reductions-Tabellen zur Gauss-PoaGENDORFFSCHEN
