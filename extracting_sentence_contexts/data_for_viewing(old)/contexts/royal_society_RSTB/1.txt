170 MR. J. W. HULKE ON POLACANTHUS FOXII.

is now evident that the pieces which I described in my paper of 1881 were not all
integers of the value of separate scutes, entering by overlap, or other arthrodial
articulation, into the composition of the shield, but (with the exception of the y spines)
were pieces originally synostosed in a continuous sheet, in which no traces of suture
or other marks of primitive distinctness are discernible.

Near its lateral and posterior border the shield is thicker than at the middle, where
it overlies the vertebral column, a fact noticed by Mr. Fox. The form of these
borders is that of a smoothly-rounded lip separated from the upper surface by a
narrow sunken groove. The continuous sweep of the posterior border is interrupted by
a wide deep notch, having at its centre a projecting part that overhung the root of
the tail. At each side of this projection is a narrow cleft ; whether natural, or a
erack produced by the yielding of the shield under compression, is uncertain. The
anterior differs from the other borders of the shield by its attenuation to a thin edge.
This circumstance, together with the truncated form of the border, suggests that the
part we actually possess does not represent the complete dorsal mail, but only a
posterior segment, between which and an anterior part, now lost, covering the thorax,
a flexible junction may have existed somewhat like that present in the plastron of
certain Chelonians.
