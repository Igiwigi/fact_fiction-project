the temperature, if we supezpose one system of temperatures on another, we alsÂ»
8uperpose the corresponding systems of forces.

Now the system of temperatures due to a solid sphere of uniform temperature
immersed in the gas, cannot of itself give rise to any force tending to move the 8phere
in one direction rather than in another. Let the sphere be placed within the finite
portion of gas which, as we have aid, is already in equilibrium. The equilibrium will
not be disturbed. We may introduce any number of spheres ab different temperatures
into the portion of gas, 80 as to form a body of any shape, heated in any manner, and
when the flow of heat has become steady the whole system will be in equilibrium,

12. How, then, are we to account for the observed fact that forces act between s0lid
bodies immersed in rarified gases, and this, apparently, as long as inequalities of
temperature are maintained ?

T think we must look for an explanation in the phenomenon discovered in the case
of liquids by HeLmnorTz and ProrROWSK1,* and for gases by KUxDT and WarBuRG,t .
that the fluid in contact with the surface of a 8olid must slide over it with a finite
velocity in order to produce finite tangential stress,

The theoretical treatment of the boundary conditions between a gas and a solid is
difficult, and it becomes more difhcult if we consider that the gas close to the surface
is probably in an unknown state of condensation. We 8hall therefore accept the
results obtained by KuxpT and WARBURG on their experimental evidence.
