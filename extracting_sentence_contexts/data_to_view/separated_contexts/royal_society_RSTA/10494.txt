The densities and
refractive indices of the two solutions, however, differ very considerably. Perhaps it
is on this account that it is possible to obtain an indistinct and undulating refraction
margin whether the Li follows Mg or Mg Li; but in neither case is the velocity
constant. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that, since there exists no difference in
potential fall at the two sides of the margin, there is no controlling force which shall
prevent the faster ion diffusing into the slower, or vice versd. Diffusion therefore
takes place, the resistances become slightly altered, and so also the potential fall and
velocities. A similar case is that of the 0Â°5 N a SO, margin.
