I proceed to the explanation of the new singularities.

13. The cnicnode, or singularity C=1, is an ordinary conical point ; instead of the
tangent plane we have a proper quadricone.

14. The cnictrope, or reciprocal singularity C'=1, is als a well known one; it is in
fact the conic of plane contact, or say rather the plane of conic contact, viz. the cnictrope
is a plane touching a surface, not at a single point, but along a conic.

15. Consider a surface having the cnicnode C=1, and the reciprocal snrface having
the cnictrope C'=1. There are on the quadricone of the cnicnode ix directions of
closest, contact *, and reciprocal thereto we have six tangents of the cnictrope conic,
touching it at six points.
