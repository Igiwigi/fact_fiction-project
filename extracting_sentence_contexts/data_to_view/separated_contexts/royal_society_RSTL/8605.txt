Lastly, rounded cavities or cups, similar to those shown in figs. 12, 13, & 14, whose
walls are formed by flattened epithelial cells, and which communicate freely with the
vesicle, may be frequently seen in an empty condition. 'The simple and, as it appears to me, the only reasonable interpretation of the above
facts is this: â€”The parenchymatous cells, either in groups or singly, lie originally in the
intervesicular tisse, outside the epithelial walls of the vesicles. They begin to make
their way into a neighbouring vesicle by pressing on the epithelial wall of one with which
they are in contact. This pressure exerted by a parenchymatous cell canses the epi-
thelial cells to lose their quadrilateral outline, and to present a more or less triangular
or crescentic appearance.
