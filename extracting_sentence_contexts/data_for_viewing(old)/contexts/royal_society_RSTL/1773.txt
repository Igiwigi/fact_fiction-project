some developement of the same power in the steel, which
is increased by the tendency that percussion has to aid its
developement in the steel, the same as it previously elicited
in the iron. By continuing this treatment, the polarity of the
steel is progressively augmented until it has acquired a max-
imum, depending, not 80 much on its own capacity for mag-
netism, as on the capability of the iron to develope it. But this
condition, it has been shown, is only a maximum 50 long as
the same iron bar or bars are used, and s0 long as their mag-
netic energy obtains no augmentation ; for if by any means
their polarity be increased, the attractive force of the steel
wires will rise in proportion. From the whole phznomena
viewed in connection, it seems, that the simple general fact
is this :â€”that percussion applied to magnetisable substances
in contact with one another, disposes them to an equality of
condition.

If this view of the subject be correct, we have a satisfactory
explanation of some of the phaznomena, which were other-
wise obscure. We' see why large bars, or wires of steel,
(though they acquire a greater quantity of magnetic energy,
as shown by their higher action' on a compass needle, than
small ones) do not attain any higher lifting powers than much
smaller ' wires. [Compare Experiments III. with VIL., and
XIV. with XVI.7] And, above all, we have an explanation
