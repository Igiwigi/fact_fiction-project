This paper is a largely updated version of the original essay: The unreasonable effectiveness of
mathematics in physics: the sixth Hilbert problem, and the ultimate Galilean revolution, written for the FQXi Contest
2015: Trick or Truth, http: / /fqxi.org /community /forum/topic/2395. Disclaimer. The fact that the author calls for a mathematization of physics does not imply that he is a good
mathematician. Reference to the authorâ€™s pet theories is only for the sake of exemplification, although
these theories were designed and elaborated exactly within the spirit and motivations of the present essay. The reader should judge the present mathematization programme independently on his opinions on these

theories.
