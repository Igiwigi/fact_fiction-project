than at any time during the normal oestrous cycle, but it died rapidly and almost com-
pletely away to return, however, in some degree after five and six injections. Again the
cells of the pars intermedia showed similar responses.

(ii) Thyroid

Normal adult. The follicles of the thyroid gland vary greatly in size and are lined by a
glandular epithelium which may be cubical or squamous in form according to the degree
of tension. The interfollicular spaces are filled with a connective tissue, and with many
cells more closely resembling those of the glandular epithelium than of normal connective
tissue. It was found that mitotic activity was extremely slight. Both the glandular epi-
thelial cells and the cells of the interfollicular spaces were only rarely seen in division, and,
in fact, the only animals in which mitoses were seen at all were those killed in full oestrus.
Even within this group there was some discrepancy, as in two of the five individuals, even
after long searches, no cell divisions were found. In the other three individuals occasional

* This account of the mitotic activity of the pituitary is based on the same material as was used elsewhere
in this paper, but the examination of the gland was made by Mr T. Kerr, who has published a detailed
account of his results in ‘ Mitotic Activity in the Female Mouse Pituitary’. J. Exp. Biol. 20 (1943) 74-78.

mitoses were discovered in the glandular as well as in the interfollicular cells, but it was
not considered worth while to attempt detailed counts.
