the Trigonia Beds at Marcham. Now, in the Osmington Oolite period, when coral reefs
were growing upon the old sandbank piled up by this river in its more vigorous youth,
we find muddy sediment entering the same corner of the district. The inference is that
the same river, in common with lesser streams farther W., had now approached nearer
its base level, and was bringing mud where formerly it brought sand and pebbles—the
natural cycle of all rivers, the effects of which are so often displayed in the so-called
“ Tripartite Series” of the English Jurassic.

If we have rightly interpreted the North Hinksey section as denoting the edge of the
area formerly occupied by the Littlemore Clay Beds (where coral growth was not quite
extinguished), then the course of the river through the coral islands to the open sea
probably lay northwards, between the hills of Wytham and Elsfield. The path of the
old river, in fact, coimcided with that of the Thames, but stoped in the opposite direction.
This may be more than mere coincidence. ‘Tertiary denudation would have lowered
the clays to a greater extent than the surrounding limestones, and a weak spot would
have been prepared, providing the easiest southward passage for the Thames.*

The neighbourhood of Littlemore has been treated in some detail because it embodies
features common to all the three more westerly occurrences of the Littlemore Clay Beds,
which only differ in that, while here they may be studied first-hand in excellent exposures,
there we have to rely chiefly upon former records for our information, and the conclusions
by themselves would seem correspondingly insecure.

The next occurrence is north of Swindon, where our only source of information is a
description of “a cutting on the M.S.W.J. Railway, east of Sparsholt (Sparcell’s) Farm
