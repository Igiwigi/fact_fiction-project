The general idea of reconstructing an asymmetric molecule
from low-exposure projections cast by randomly oriented
‘copies’ or realizations of that molecule was first formulated
in 1975 [8] and later put into practice through the development
of an image processing system, SPIDER [9]. Importantly,
the method is based on the ability to align such low-exposure
images by cross-correlation with sufficient accuracy to deter-
mine the molecule’s structure [10]. A brief account of the
early development of mathematical concepts and compu-
tational approaches has been given elsewhere [11]. What is
important, in the context of this review, are two distinct
advantages of the single-particle over crystallographic
methods [12,13]. One is the fact that the imaging of the mol-
ecule in single, non-attached form is likely to yield a more
authentic structure—unaffected by interaction of the molecule
with its neighbours, and arguably more representative of the
free molecule in solution. In contrast, both X-ray crystallo-
graphy and electron crystallography [14] result in structures
that are influenced by the energy minimization inherent in
the formation of a closely packed crystal, and thus may signifi-
cantly differ from the structures assumed by the functional
molecule in the course of its work cycle. The second advan-
tage of single-particle techniques is related to the fact that
