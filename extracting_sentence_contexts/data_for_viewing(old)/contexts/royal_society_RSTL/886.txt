the alloy, which predominated in the upper part of the mass
when in the crucible, and consequently was the first which
entered and filled the lower part of the mould, $0 that the finer
and more heavy gold, at the bottom of the crucible, was that
which formed the upper part of the bar; and it must be obvious,
that the congelation was too rapid in the mould, to allow any
very material change to take place after the metal was poured.

The foregoing facts being considered, it is possible to con-
ceive, that a bar of alloyed gold may be throughout of equal
specific gravity, and nevertheless not be of an uniform value
or quality ; for the finer quality of the upper extremity, when
not considerable, may at times be compensated by the superior
density of the bottom ; but such effects can only take place
within a very limited sphere.

Exclusive of the causes lately enumerated, which occasion
variations more or less considerable in the specific gravity of
metals, there is another, which, I believe, has never been noticed;
it is true that its effects, when compared with those already
mentioned, are but small; but stil it appears proper that it
