6. Cohomological consequences

We have seen in Lemma 5.2 that, up to a factor (—1/ vat ,Ma,p is a polynomial in q, in principle
quite explicit. A natural question is the extent to which we can infer from such information
the vanishing, or non-vanishing, of various cohomology groups. Here are some results along
this line.

Let us begin with the fact that Mj 1 (F,) = 1. By the Lefschetz Trace Formula, this is equivalent to

2n
S\(-1)'Trace(Frobr, AR F@F*’))=q".
i=0

Already the trace on the H2" is q”. This suggests that Hi(A! , F @ F”) vanishes for i # 2n. We will

now show that this is in fact the case. Here is an equivalent formulation.
The sheaf F @ FY = End(F) has a direct sum decomposition

End(F) = Qe @ End°(F),
