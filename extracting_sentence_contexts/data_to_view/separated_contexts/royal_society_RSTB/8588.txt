Fusion of filament and
portion of the literature on integration concern the integration style tissues can lead to an increase or decrease in measured (statistical) phenotypic
and/or modularity of flowers. The origins of this interest can integration of pistil and stamen, depending, respectively, on whether the portions
be traced back to a pair of papers by Berg [30,31], which have of the stamen filaments fused to the style (dotted lines) are, or are not, included in
stimulated much of the research on integration and modularity the stamen measurements. (The former analysis would depend on phylogenetic/
in plants and other organisms (see review by Murren [7] and evolutionary or developmental insights.) (Online version in colour.)

discussion by Conner & Lande [130]). Despite the fact that
Berg’s papers focused primarily on homeostasis and modular-
ity (‘correlation pleiades’), most of the subsequent literature
stimulated by Berg’s work has addressed patterns of inte-
gration [130]. This paradox reflects the fact that there are two
divergent interpretations of her thinking that probably
stemmed from the various ideas developed by Berg regarding
the effects of specialized pollination on flowers. We illustrate
this with the following quotations:

integration was achieved by the reduction of floral parts
via fusion (third statement), and not by simple stabilizing
selection on the different parts, as often suggested in the lit-
erature.
