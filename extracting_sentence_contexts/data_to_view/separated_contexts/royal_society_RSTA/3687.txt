In particular, now also the products that are formed through TSp
are obtained and the corresponding pathway is much shorter than that supposed to occur from
PES analysis (and also from a kinetic study on this PES).

4. Concluding remarks

The most relevant conclusion of our re-visiting the CID reactivity of [Ca(formamide)}*+ molecular
ions is that only a part of the observed reactivity can be accounted for from a survey of the
topology of the PES, and from a kinetic treatment that only takes into consideration statistically
driven processes. In fact, it seems that a complete picture can be only obtained when direct
collision and post-TS dynamics are accounted for. Indeed, some reaction paths are only open if one
does not impose a statistical behaviour to the system, that is, if one allows for non-IRC processes
to occur. This is precisely the case when the flux bifurcates on the downhill pathway towards
products, after crossing a given TS.
