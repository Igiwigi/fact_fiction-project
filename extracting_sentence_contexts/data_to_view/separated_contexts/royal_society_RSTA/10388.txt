But no effect whatever was produced in the photographs—doubt-
less because the gases were still burning. Indeed, most of the photographs show that
the region is only comparatively dark. I would draw attention to the fact that when no sound-waves interfere with the
flame, the retonation-wave is very brilliant ; when the flame is crossed several times
BS by reflected waves, the light is more evenly distributed. Nos. 63 and 64, taken under
@the same conditions, illustrate this fact. The phenomenon is explained on the
Bascumption that in the region traversed by the flame the gases are still burning, and
‘§ the sound-waves, when they enter this region, bring about an increase in the rate of
@ combination.
