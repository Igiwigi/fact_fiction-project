dissepiments between the somites do not persist for any length of time, but the mesen-
teries persist throughout life. The dorsal mesentery forms, by the separation of its two
halves, a dorsal sinus that plays an important part in the circulation in the absence of
a true heart. According to this observer, then, the primary body cavity persists in the
posterior part of the body only as the dorsal sinus. The perivisceral cavity, being
formed by the fusion of the somite cavities, is thus a secondary body cavity. Itis obvious
that the account given by Ursanowicz differs entirely from the generally accepted
view as to the relations of the body cavity of the Crustacea. The careful researches of
GROBBEN (8) on Cetochilus do not lend support to the findings of UrnaNnowicz. He states
that in the metanauplius of Cetochilus there are transverse plates of connective-tissue
cells that divide the body cavity more or less into compartments. These plates are
placed inter-segmentally, and from their position might be regarded as dissepiments.
He points out, however, that their incompleteness and the fact that they are made up
of very few cells does not support this view.

Among the Phyllopoda there is a paper in Russian by Nassonow (18), in which there
is a figure of a horizontal section of the nauplius of Artemia showing a paired series of
cavities in the posterior segments of the body, and which, according to Korscuetr and
Herper, are taken to represent a temporary development of paired ccelomic vesicles.
In the nearly related genus Branchipus, Ciaus (6) did not find this state of affairs. Pos-
sibly the cavities figured by Nassonow merely represent splits in the mesoderm which
