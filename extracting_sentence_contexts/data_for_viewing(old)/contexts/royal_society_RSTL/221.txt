which is now adopted. By Smithson Tennant, Esq. F. R.S.

Tur great discovery of Sir H. Davy, that the alkalies might
be decomposed by the Voltaic electricity, was soon succeeded
by that of Gay Lussac and THENARD, who shewed that a
similar decomposition of them might be produced by means
of iron. |

Besides the new and unexpected fact which was thus brought
to light, that the alkaline metals might be deprived of oxygen
by a substance inferior to them in attraction ; this new pro-
cess was highly valuable, in affording the means of obtaining
them far more abundantly than by electricity.

The circumstances described by Gay Lussac and THENARD,
as requisite for producing the decomposition of the alkalies by
iron, are first, that the iron should be intensely heated, and after-
wards that the alkalies should, be brought in contact with, it in
that heated state. For this purpose a furnace must be made,
capable of admitting a gun, barrel, containing the. iron turn-
ings, to pass through it, and a short piece of barrel containing
