Intrafilamentar Septa.

The filaments of Arca have intrafilamentar septa, whereas those of 7'rigonia have
not. The upper extremities of the ascending filaments of Arca are in ciliary connec-
tion with one another, whereas those of Z’rigonia are in organic connection. In these

two facts, taken together, there lies a fascinating suggestion that when the ascending
filaments are not in mutual organic connection the blood circulating in them must
come back again to the gill-axis, and that the intrafilamentar septum serves to keep
the two currents distinct ; whereas when the ascending filaments are united, the blood
passes in one direction only along the filament, either down the descending filament
and up the ascending filament and out into adjacent parts, or the reverse,* and an
intrafilamentar septum is in such case no longer essential, This tempting hypothesis
has not escaped previous writers. MniGAUX, for instance, states that the difference
in the circulation in the gills of the Mytilidés and the Arcadés (62, pp. 226 and 227)
is related to the absence or presence of the intrafilamentar septum, and PELsENEER
(71, p. 245) states even more definitely that the difference “peut s’expliquer par le
fait que le septum a dti disparaitre aussitét que la concrescence, par leur bord
dorsal, des filaments réfiéchis, a permis la communication entre les filaments
