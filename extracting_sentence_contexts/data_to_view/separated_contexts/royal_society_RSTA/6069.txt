In such
a structure, the powers of H (and its time derivatives) are of even adiabatic order. This means
that all of the permitted powers effectively carry an even number of time derivatives of the scale
factor, which is essential to preserve the general covariance of the action. Linear terms (cubic, or in
general of odd order) in H are incompatible with covariance and in fact do not appear in the final
result. To be more precise, all terms with an odd number of time derivatives of the scale factor)
are ruled out by covariance and never enter our calculation. On the other hand, the form of pyac(H) predicted by the RVM at low energies is no less
interesting.
