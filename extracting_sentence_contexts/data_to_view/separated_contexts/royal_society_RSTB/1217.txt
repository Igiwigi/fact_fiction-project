64 of L. clavatum, the
s of the similarity between them will be sufficiently plain. The potential
rium of Jsoetes clearly corresponds to the curved sporogenous mass of Lyco-
the chief difference lying in the differentiation of the former into sterile
glee and sporogenous masses. In fact, if we imagine a heterosporous Lycopod
bs sporangium widened out radially, and its enlarged sporogenous mass partly

Bd so as to form trabeculie, the result would be practically what is seen in

often wrongly assumed that the sporangia of Isoetes are actually partitioned,

e of the published drawings, if not corrected by description, support this

radiate upwards from the subarchesporial pad; they are frequently very

ss have been chosen, the specimen drawn as fig.
