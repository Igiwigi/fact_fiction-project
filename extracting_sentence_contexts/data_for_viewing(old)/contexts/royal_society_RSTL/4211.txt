pointed extremity being inserted into its whole length). Mucous membrane of the
stomach and vena cava at the entrance of the hepatic veins. Mucous membrane of
the stoinach and vena porta. Contents of caput coli and blood. Mucous membrane
of the ilium and blood on its outer surface,

In one experiment the liver was much diseased, dark-coloured, and half the usual
Size; the rabbit appeared weak and unable to support itself.

The parts in the last experiment were covered over with a towel and allowed to
remain undisturbed for eight hours. It will be unnecessary to state the circuits that
were then formed, with their results, and likewise those in a rabbit, which died from
natural causes, twenty-two, twenty-five, and thirty-nine hours after death, as the fol-
lowing experiment containing the principal facts worthy of notice will be related at
full length.

Experiment 11.—Rabbit six hours after death, which arose from natural causes.
The surface of the viscera and contents of the abdomen were remarkable for their
appearance, being s0 similar to that of a healthy and live rabbit. The veins being
full of fluid blood, a favourable opportunity occurred of ascertaining whether the
same effects would be produced as in the living animal.

'The following circuits were formed :—The blood flowing from the ilinm, an empty
portion of the descending colon, and caput coli and the mucous membrane of these
parts; in the latter only did any effect occur, the mucous membrane slightly positive.
