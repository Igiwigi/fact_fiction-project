In selecting the materials to be tested it was considered desirable to include those
for which the properties at liquid air temperature had previously been ascertained
HApFIELD (loc. cit.). Tn all some 31 of these materials were included, making the selection as representative
as possible, but with a preference for those which had retained some ductility in liquid
air, specially the alloys containing nickel. These particular materials can be clearly
identified in Tables I to V, from the fact that the results previously obtained in liquid
air are shown for them. The 10 remaining materials, of which four are non-ferrous, were selected from among
the special alloys which have subsequently come into prominence. They will be
described individually later in discussing the results obtained from them.
