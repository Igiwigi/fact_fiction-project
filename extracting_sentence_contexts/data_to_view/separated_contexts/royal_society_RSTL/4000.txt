W. H. MILLER ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW STANDARD POUND. By a mean of the 60 comparisons,
AzH=â€”0-00143 grain in air (f=19'97, b=757-28). The value of these observations is considerably diminished by the fact that B con-
tained a small cavity filled with some hygroscopic substance, which renders its weight

slightly variable. The following comparisons of V+0:03 grain with the sum of the auxiliary weights
M, N, (32) were made with RosinsoXN's 104-inch balance. Z=M+N+(32)+0-45 grain.
