She recommends that Experiment No. 8 should be
discarded, on the ground of the point of commencement not haying been so sharply
marked. It will be noticed that the above tables indicate two things: firstly, that on the
whole the melting-point is lower when the sulphur is raised to it suddenly ; and
secondly, that all the melting-points are considerably above those given by Bropte. The reason probably is to be found either in the fact that Bropin used imperfectly

purified sulphur, or that there is a constant evror in our thermometers, which we have
no reason to believe. The fact probably is that Bropre did not sufficiently purify
his crystals from the evil-smelling compounds which they carry with them from the
bisulphide.
