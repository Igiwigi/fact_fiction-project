But gold, mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth follow each other in the classification
of elements based on increasing atomic weight, and are grouped on the same horizontal
line of Menpeteer’s table. This coincidence is curious. Whatever it may signify,
this transformation of the structure of a metal, at a temperature so far below its
melting point, in the presence of only two-tenths per cent. of a foreign body, is
probably not an isolated fact, and appears to open a new field for research.
