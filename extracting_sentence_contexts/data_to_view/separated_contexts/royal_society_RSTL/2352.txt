In neither of these bars are there any indications of other poles than those
whose 8ituations F observed. I am not aware of any experiments having been made to ascertain
whether in magnetized stcel bars the action of the magnetic particles upon each other has a tendency
to restore a symmetrical arrapgement of their magnetism when such arrangement has been disturbed ;
but the results I have obtained show that if such tendency exist for a short time after this disturbance,
it 800n, at least in some cases, either ceases to exist, or is 80 feeble as not to overcome, or to overcome
very slowly, the coercive force of the steel. In the bars which I employed, this coercive force could
not be great, if it depend upon hardness, since they are softer than requisite for working with a file,
We ought, however, to be in possession of more extended observations before we draw any general
coneclusions from such facts as T have stated,

an opening from top to bottom parallel to its sides, of the same size as the
stems of two clamping screws fixed to the rectangular scale, before mentioned,
to which the needle under trial was attached. This rectangular support was |
rendered yertical by means of foot-screws, and a level attached to it ; 80 that
when the scale was applied to it, the axis of the needle to be examined was
likewise vertical; and the instrument was adjusted 80 that the axis of this needle
andthe centre of the needle I, were in the magnetic meridian. In the same
horizontal plane as the centre of I, was an index, which marked on the scale
the point of the needle on it horizontally opposite to that centre.
