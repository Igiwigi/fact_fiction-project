The variance o?(n)) for samples each consisting of ny) values of z drawn at random is
also determinate, and can be easily calculated for any particular abstract distribution of z. The variance (1) of the individual values of z is also, of course, known or can be easily
calculated for any particular distribution of z. In fact, under certain mild and well-known

restrictions, usually
o? (mo) = 07(1)/Mo; (70-1)

provided that n, is small compared to Nj, the total number of cells; otherwise there is a
correcting term. The above equation may also be written in the form

0? (No) /oo(1)
