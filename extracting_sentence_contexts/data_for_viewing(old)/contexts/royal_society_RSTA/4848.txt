mathematical physics 2008 have twistor methods emerged as yielding efficient
new methods for calculating scattering amplitudes.

Keywords: This brief review will describe this recent sequence
twistor theory, scattering amplitudes, of developments, with an emphasis on the fwistor

diagram formalism. Twistor diagrams were conceived as
roughly analogous to Feynman diagrams, as used since
the 1940s for the calculation of scattering amplitudes.

Author for correspondence: They have in fact led the way to a completely new
Andrew Hodges picture of amplitudes. This review of the sequence of

acquainted with the ideas of relativistic quantum field
theory, but have not been closely involved in these new
developments.

The central point is that twistor geometry makes
manifest conformal symmetry within Minkowski space—
time, and conformal symmetry has increasingly been
recognized as a feature of fundamental physics. Con-
formal symmetry is a ‘hidden’ symmetry, not obvious
