INFLUENCE OF ExtTERNAL ConpITIONS ON Protozoa AND BACTERIA.

The numbers of all the organisms counted show large fluctuations of two kinds,
viz., daily and seasonal, The size of the changes that take place within so short a
time as 24 hours is perhaps the most surprising fact that the experiment has
revealed. Thus the three consecutive samples 246, 247 and 248 give 58°0, 14°25

and 26°25 million bacteria respectively. The changes exhibited by any of the
species of protozoa are at times even larger, and affect the active and encysted
stages apparently quite indifferently. It is, in fact, not uncommon for the numbers
of any species to vary from a few hundred or a few thousand to 400,000 or more
within 24 hours, and the percentage of these in the active condition may jump from
0 to nearly 100 in a similar interval (e.g. Dimastigameba, samples 250, 251;
Cercomonas, samples 221, 222 ; Oicomonas, samples 245, 246; etc.).
