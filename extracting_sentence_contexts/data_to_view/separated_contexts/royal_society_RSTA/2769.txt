in length for
accurate measurements of the magnetic rotatory dispersion, were not successful;
although the material contained fewer bubbles than the dises prepared a few years
before, the triple field of the polarimeter could not be seen through the rod, which
gave instead a splendid demonstration of Arry’s spirals. As contrasted with the exact accordance, throughout the range from 6708 to 4359,
of the two series of dispersion-ratios for quartz, it may be noted that the nearest
approach to equality in a series of 23 alcohols was found in the alcohol phenylmethyl-
carbinol which gave for the ratio 4359/5461

Magnetic 1°739, Optical 1°736. But the accidental nature of this concordance is clearly shown by the fact that the
next homologue phenylethyl-carbinol gave the values

Magnetic 1°731, Optical 1°674.

10. Summary. (1) A large crystal of optically perfect levo-quartz has been found which produced
a rotation of 25°°5371 per mm.
