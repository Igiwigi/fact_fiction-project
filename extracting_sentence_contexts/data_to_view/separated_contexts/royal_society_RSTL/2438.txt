But the affinities
Sf the vitriolic acid air with various ſubſtances, and many
of the phenomena attending it, are ftrikingly different
Jrom thoſe of the marine acid air. I thought it a little
Singular, that the ſolution of iron, zinc, and tin, in a di-
Juted vitriolic acid ſhould yield inflammable air; and that

chiefly yield acid air, which is not at all inflammable,
