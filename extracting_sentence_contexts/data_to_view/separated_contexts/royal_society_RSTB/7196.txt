Moreover, if the mean values for red and green be compared with
those of yellow, it will be seen (table 105) that in no single case is there agreement between

them. TABLE 105. RETINAL DIRECTION EFFECT (STILES & CRAWFORD)

Now if the yellow sensation were in fact a mixture of red and green sensations, it would
be expected that the direction effect for yellow would have a value which is equal, or nearly
equal, to the mean values for red and green; but such is not the case. This suggests that the
visual mechanism for yellow is separate from that of both red and green.

(146) The colour discrimination curve

On the basis of Youngâ€™s theory it would be expected that there would be poor colour
discrimination at each end of the spectrum, since only one sensation is aroused here. In
the green region, discrimination would be expected to be better,-because the red- and blue-
sensation curves are both approaching the base line.
