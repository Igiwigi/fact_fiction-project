social sciences. We suggest that infectious diseases can usefully
be seen in the framework of complex systems science and, fol-
lowing the weight of evidence from theoretical epidemiology,
we argue that heterogeneity of the social context significantly
impacts infectious disease dynamics. The identification and
measurement of social heterogeneity (e.g. of behaviour,
mobility, structure, density, etc.) is really the substance of the
empirical social sciences. Harnessing the methodological
tools, theoretical perspectives and general knowledge base of
the social sciences will greatly increase the sophistication—
and predictive power—of models of disease emergence,
control and eradication [102]. Equally important from the per-
spective of collaborative buy-in from social scientists, the fact
that these topics are essential to understanding disease emer-
gence incentivizes professional collaborations, although

interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary funding opportunities
remain limited.

Disease emergence and the spread of epidemics rely on the
behaviours of individual people, the social structures in which
they are embedded and the political economy that makes par-
ticular social outcomes more likely for some people than for
others. We have chosen four particular areas of study for this
paper—structure and mixing, space and mobility, geography
