any limitation.

If there is little to choose between the two systems of confidence intervals (50) and

(51), and (62) and (63) from the point of view of probability of correct statements,
there are other aspects which easily determine the choice. In problems of estimation
by interval, it is natural to try to get as narrow confidence intervals as possible.
Comparing again (66) and (67), we find that the latter interval is considerably
shorter than the former. It is easy to see that this is a general rule. In fact, what-
ever the mean, x, if both x, and x, are necessarily positive, then

and it follows from (64) and (65) that
(3/8) 3, (E) <8; (E) < (3/4) 8, (E), ... «=... 2 3(69)

showing that the length of the confidence interval determined by (62) and (63) is
always less than 3/4 of that determined by (50) and (51). Itis obvious, therefore, that
the confidence intervals defined by (62) and (63) compared to the other system have
definite advantages. These advantages, however, are independent of the conception
of probability.

Using again the analogy with the games of chance, we may say that while the ruies
