Spinion that “ the differences between the numbers given by the optical method are,
ferhaps, not much in excess of the probable error of experiment, but in the case of
the electrical observations they far exceeded it.”t We then proceeded, in a passage
which it is perhaps unnecessary to quote at length, to give reasons for our belief that
2 the thickness of the black portions is really different in different films,” and added
it “into the cause of the variations in the thickness of different black films we do
t now propose to enquire.” Since that date we have made a large number of new
experiments in which the thicknesses of black films of different composition have
been determined both by electrical and optical methods. Some of the observations
were described to the Society in a paper “ On Black Soap Films,” which was read on
March 1, 1890, The main object then before us was to enquire whether the rate of
formation of the black depends on its thickness. Before the paper was published,
facts came to our knowledge which appeared to show that however this might
be, there was an undoubted and much more clearly marked relation between the com-
