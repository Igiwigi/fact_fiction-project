Stomach and gall-bladder ; no effect. In these and the following experiments the electrodes were cleaned after the for-
mation of a previous circuit, whenever the substances adhering to them might
influence the result, Repeating the experiments of Mavrevcer and of Doxxs, only
once did the effect occur, and that but slight, in the guinea-pig. The following fact
may perhaps account for it. Instead of the plates dipping into the mercury, the points were used for this pur-

pose, and the surface of the plates served to form the free extremities of the electrodes.

'The stomach was laid open, one of the plates pressed on the mucous membrane, the
other upon the surface of the liver; a decided effect was now produced upon the
needle, and by making and breaking contact s0 as to catch the vibrations of the
needle, made to increase to 15* or 20%.
