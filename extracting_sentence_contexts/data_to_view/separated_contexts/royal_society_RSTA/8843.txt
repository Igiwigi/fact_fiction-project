The lists and sounders are given in the same table as for the
standard series, in the first and third columns respectively. The considerations adduced
enable us to feel that the ground is safe in recognising that parallel series depending
on displacements on the limit D(«)=S() really exist. The evidence does not
depend on a single numerical coincidence of a line, or of a line found by sounding, but
on the fact that these numerical coincidences appear for so many sounding links in
all the 15 sets tested. This is not affected by the high probability that several of the
sounded lines are chance coincidences, This result then gives more confidence to the
method partially applied above, in the application of the law that the D sequences
must have mantissee which differ by multiples of the oun from multiples of A,, or in
other words must be themselves multiples of the oun. This method consisted in
testing certain lines to see whether by using the displaced limits (y3,) D (c%)—now
seen to really exist—the above relation holds.
