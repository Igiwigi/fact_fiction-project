The application of the plumb-line, as already described, is

regards the vertical axis rather than any other part, and is,
in fact, exactly analogous to the usual verification of a zenith
Sector.

During the period in which I was engaged in making ob-

their construction, which relates to their adjustment, was
capable of being improved.

In order to render the nature of the improvement, which I
