One of these
enlargements included the whole of the spectrum as transmitted through a dispersive
system composed of two glass prisms, from the green at wave-length 5383 to the early
ultra-violet wave-length 3491. The other spectrum, transmitted through a quartz-
calcite train and dispersed by two pairs of quartz prisms, covered the range from wave-
length 3542 to the point at wave-length 2327, at which the iron spectrum diminishes
suddenly in intensity and becomes unsuitable for polarimetric work. The fact that
these two enlargements were already available provided a very strong motive for using
the iron spectrum as the basis of the new series of observations. It was these considerations, together with the important part played by the iron are
in the development of standard series of wave-lengths, that led us finally to concentrate
our efforts almost exclusively on determining the rotations produced by quartz in the
lines of this spectrum. A larger number of lines, extending also somewhat farther into
the ultra-violet, could have been obtained by using electrodes of nickel-steel instead of
iron ; but in view of the extra difficulty of identifying the nickel lines, and the fact that
their wave-lengths were less certain than those of the iron lines, the idea of using’ this
spectrum was abandoned after a trial, and no attempt was made to work up the photo-
graphs that had been taken with these electrodes.
