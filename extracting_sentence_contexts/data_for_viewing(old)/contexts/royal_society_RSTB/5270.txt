The F, families from this cross numbered ten, one of which bred true for A, one for
B, and five for Bt. The remaining three families were from reciprocal crosses between
plants of the A and B types in family 15-26. Two of these families segregate in the
F, into the parental types, while from the third a single B plant developed.

Conclusions.

S From the five generations of cultures, the conclusion may be drawn that the F, of
2 Oe. ammophila x (biennis X rubricalyx) called B' breeds true in many families, but
= splits in some F, families into twin types which agree in their main features with the F,
S types from the reciprocal, although the F, generations are so different. When the A
iz and B types are crossed, they segregate into the parental types in F,. The most
ia striking fact concerning these triple hybrids is thus that they give rise to twin types
= which breed true in the main. The B type may also segregate the A type, but not
i] vice versa. These and similar true-breeding hybrids in Oenothera appear to be
EE explained in part by the linkage of their chromosomes during meiosis, to be described
g in the next section. From this we may draw the conclusion that it is possible that new
E species of Oenothera (and probably of some other genera) arise through crossing and

remain constant through linkage of non-homologous chromosomes. How widespread
this process may be in nature remains to be determined.

On the other hand, we have seen that certain families, such as 24:25 and 7-25,
segregate into forms essentially resembling the two grandparental types. Thus the
twin types produced appear to represent a partial and incomplete return to the original
