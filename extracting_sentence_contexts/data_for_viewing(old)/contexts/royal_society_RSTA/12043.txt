public libraries. The results of the geodetic operations may, however, be summarized —
and capitulated in a comparatively small space; it seems desirable that this should -
be done, in order to place them within convenient reach of all mathematicians wishing —
to investigate the figure of the earth. I have therefore extracted from the published —
volumes all that is of essential importance in relation to geodesy, and added to it
several latitude determinations which I have recently received from the Survey and —
which have not as yet been published, all which I trust will be found of convenience —
and utility in future geodetic investigations. :
I now propose to give first a general sketch of the operations from their origin to. ‘
their conclusion; then to describe the measurements of the base-lines and the
principal angles, the instruments employed, and the method which was taken to bring
the very vast amount of measurements, each one necessarily fallible, into harmony —
with each other, so as to secure the smallest possible disturbance of the original facts —
of observation. The next thing will be to give a brief description of the instruments —
and methods employed for the latitude observations, and a synopsis of the results, and
to do the same for the electro-telegraphic determinations of differences of longitude 5
then to examine the extent to which these operations have been influenced by local
deflections of the plumb-line on the meridian and on the prime vertical. It will be.
seen that great deflections of the plumb-line are met with, not only in the vicinity
mountain masses, but in plains where there are no elevations or irregularities
