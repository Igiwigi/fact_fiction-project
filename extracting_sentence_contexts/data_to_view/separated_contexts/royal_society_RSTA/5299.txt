Size is one of these parameters, but is not the unique
one. It may turn out that processes taking place along hundreds of angstroms (just
100 atoms in a row) are already sufficiently large to obey laws that—although
having a quantum ingredient—in principle are valid only macroscopically, such
as black-body radiation [27].

(b) Can quantum mechanics be intrinsically nonlinear? Assume that a process is, in fact, quantum at the characteristic sizes we
shall study. We can ask then if exactly the same type of nonlinear effects
emerging in classical physics at those scales (cf. §2a) could occur in the
