With the final contribution by Dombovari et al. [18], we close the loop and come back to
time-delay dynamics in engineering, namely the impact of delays in metal cutting. In particular,
undesired self-excited machine tool vibrations in milling can be explained by the regenerative
effect, which is a closed-loop between tool vibrations at the present cut generated by a wavy
surface left by the previous cut. The authors give a brief overview on the literature in this field and
review results on a bi-stability between the stable cutting solution and the undesired chattering
motion. They present measurements which prove the existence of the bistable domain (or unsafe
zone) and are used to determine the size of these zones.

3. Conclusion

The first two contributions [6,7] already point out the complexity of the topic due to the fact that,
even after decades of intensive research on time delay systems, there are still open fundamental
questions for scalar systems with one fixed delay. Other contributions show that the research
trend goes toward studying systems with multiple delays and distributed delays, and that only
little is known for systems with time-varying delay or state-dependent delay. However, these
delays are the most realistic ones because in many systems in engineering and nature the delays
are not constant but rather variable. In other words, the question is not only if we can neglect the
effect of time delays but also if we can neglect fluctuations of the delay or a state-dependence of
the delay. We think this theme issue will advance the subject of complex time delay dynamics in


this direction. Moreover, the theoretical contributions in this issue and the corresponding ongoing
research will stimulate developments towards new applications.
