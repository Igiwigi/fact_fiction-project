That this rise
was continued to at least 200 ft. above its present level is shown by the discovery of
two unrolled Chellean implements in some gravels exposed at Kabua waterhole. As Dr Leakey has pointed out, similar types of primitive hand axe have been known
to occur even with Acheulean cultures, and they are therefore not absolute evidence of
the Chellean age of these deposits. Nevertheless, the fact that such primitive types
were found, while more advanced ones were completely absent, is in itself some
evidence that they are of early age, for wherever Acheulian implements occurred they
did so in considerable quantity. It should also be remarked that deposits about 130 ft.
above the Kabua waterhole gravels bore implements of Acheulian stage 3 upon their
surface. Furthermore, no fauna of any kind was discovered in any of the deposits
which yielded Chellean implements, while, on the other hand, those which contained
Acheulian artifacts were usually highly fossiliferous.
