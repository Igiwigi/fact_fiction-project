'Thus, as is well known, considerable
contraction in volume follows the mixing of alcohol and water ; but this contraction is
not, as might be supposed, in any degree proportional to the amount of heat evolved. Thus the maximum contraction takes place in a mixture containing about 45 per cent.
of alcohol, whereas the maximum amount of heat is eyolyed at an alcoholic strength of
about 30 per cent. The maximum elevation of the specific heat above its calculated
mean value is also observed at this strength of 30 per cent. ; and hence, in order to recon-
cile the above theory with fact, we must as8ume on the one hand that the amount of
combination taking place at any given temperature is greatest when 30 parts of alcohol
are mixed with 70 parts of water, and on the other that a given rise of temperature will
produce in this mixture of alcohol and water a greater amount of decomposition or
dissociation than in any other. We should thus have the maximum amount of chemical
action and the feeblest union both occurring with one and the same proportion of alcohol
and water. The rate of expansion.
