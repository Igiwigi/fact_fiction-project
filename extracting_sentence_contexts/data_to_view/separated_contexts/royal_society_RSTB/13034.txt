Both of the Nigericin-treated groups were signifi-
cantly depolarized relative to controls (**p<0.01 Student's
T-test), while there were no significant differences between
the treated samples. Note also that the altered pattern gets
stronger between one and three weeks (with no further treat-
ment), as discussed above in the context of consolidation and
construction of memories in the brain. These data reveal the
remarkable fact that very brief alterations of bioelectric mech-
anics are remembered by tissue as long-term stable
alterations in resting membrane potential in planaria.

10. Conclusion

Regeneration highlights numerous aspects of robust control that
are challenging to explain via purely molecular-genetic path-
way paradigms. These include: the ability of cellular systems
to coordinate activity across large distances, to process spatial
information at multiple scales (including those much bigger
than single cells), to integrate stochastic and noisy behaviour
of micro-agents into organ-level decisions, to store ‘potential’,
future, or ‘counterfactual’ pattern memories that may be latent
(not expressed as anatomy now, but guiding future anatomical
events if recalled by injury) in addition to ones that are expressed
(as control of morphogenetic mechanisms in the current anat-
omy), and to organize activity that works towards specific
invariant outcomes (anatomical specifications) despite pertur-
bations.
