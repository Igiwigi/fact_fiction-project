ants are notorious, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so large as the quarter of a

marvellous atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more so than the brain of a man.

When Charles Darwin wrote these words, almost 150 years ago, our under-
standing of the nervous systems of animals was rudimentary. In fact, neurons
had only been discovered a mere 34 years earlier—by the great Czech anatomist
Jan Evangelista Purkinje. Yet by 1871, when Darwin wrote The Descent of Man,
it was already accepted that a larger brain relative to body size is likely con-
nected to higher mental capacities, a line of reasoning that Darwin also
accepted. So his insight concerning the brains of ants was truly visionary, argu-
ably the first recognition that the sheer mass of a nervous tissue is not the sole
arbiter of behavioural or cognitive performance (as the remarkable higher cog-
nitive abilities of ‘small-brained’ birds such as corvids are now confirming).
And today, almost a century and a half later, Darwin’s words about insects
ring truer than ever—our sophisticated modern methods for recording from
single neurons, for studying the functions of specific brain regions, and for
tracking the responses of insects in cleverly designed behavioural paradigms,
