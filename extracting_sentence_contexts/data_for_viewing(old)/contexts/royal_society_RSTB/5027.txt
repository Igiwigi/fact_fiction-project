of the wound stimulus in the older parts. However the cause of greater accumulation
of resin canals in the older parts of the plant may ultimately be explained, the fact
has a distinct bearing on the phylogenetic interpretation that is sometimes put on the
occurrence of resin canals in cone axes, vigorous branches, etc., of mature trees. In
the case of Picea at least these are the result of wounding, and we strongly suspect
that when the contentious forms themselves are studied more carefully in the light of
the present investigations a similar interpretation will be found to hold. Their sporadic

occurrence would then be associated with the contingency of wounding, and not with
their character as vestigial structures. In fact, their presence would be interpreted as
a cenogenetic feature, the forms having them in greatest abundance being the most
specialised.

As in the case of the histological structure of the ligneous resin canals, a
comparison of the spruce with the pine and the balsam was made, so here we may
compare these forms in the gross features of the arrangement of their resin canals
produced by wounding. In Abies sometimes several tangential series of canals occur
in response to wounding. This indicates that the wound stimulus persists and acts
intermittently, as in the spruce, so that Abies has the basic feature of radial scattering.
The recurrent stimulus, however, acts more definitely in Abies than in Picea, resulting
in another tangential series, while in Picea such subsequent tangential series are confined
to the neighbourhood of the wound, and the main response is of the scattered type.
