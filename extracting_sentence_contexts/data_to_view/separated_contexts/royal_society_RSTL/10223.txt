DR. EK. B. WILSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENILLA. 753

points out the fact that intra-cellular or amoboid digestion is confined, 80 far as known,
to the most primitive groups of the Metazoa and in the Cotenterates seems to be
the normal and most frequent if not the only process. The digestive functions of an
entoderm cell in these cases are identical with those of a unicellular Protozoa, and
MErsCHNIKOFF is inclined to consider the former as an actual survival of the latter—a
physiological character which was originally present in all Metazoa then existing, and
has only been lost in higher forms. LANKEsTER even 8uggests that the absorption of
unsaponified fats in the highest Metazoa may possibly be a las relic of the primitive
mode of digestion.
& None of the writers on this subject have pointed out the identity of the process with
S that of the absorption of the yolk in Astacus, described by RecnexBACH in 1877
