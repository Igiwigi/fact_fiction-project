These are probably the transverse fibres
which are considered to extend across the middle line to the other hemisphere, and
to have a different course from those described above as lying internal to the optic
thalamus. When traced outwards they join the base of the knob-like projection of
the outer fibres of the fornix above referred to, and beyond this they pass into the
cortex of the cornu Ammonis. It is exceedingly difficult to separate the course of these fibres of the fornix from
those of the corpus callosum, but one is helped by the fact that the latter are stained
by Wetcert’s method a deep blue, almost black colour, while the fibres of the
fornix are stained a lighter tint (see corpus callosum, p. 174). In fig. 29 (F.1.) the knob-like projection of the external fibres of the fornix, which
we may now call the tenia hippocampi, or fimbria, is still seen to be descending, and
to have the same relations in the lateral ventricle to the surrounding parts as before. At the base of the projection we have the light-coloured fibres of the transverse part

of the fornix, and behind them the transverse fibres of the forceps major of the corpus

callosum.
