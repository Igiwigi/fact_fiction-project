slow and rapid series, and those of the average series which do not follow strictly the
pattern of their class. That the immature to mature shift is not something which auto-
matically occurs between 8 and 12 days is shown by series 130h, 994, 132; that it occurs

automatically and without reference to graft breakdown, once a high immature per-
centage is attained, is disproved by the behaviour of series 65h, 56h and 64h described
below. Reference will be made to table 1 for the amount of destruction in each case.
Slow series. 130h. This series had an exceptionally large concentration of both lympho-
cytes and pyronin cells both at 8 and 12 days. It showed no signs of destruction at either
stage (cf. table 1). The fact that its percentage of immature pyronin cells was 42 °%, at both
times is in agreement with the hypothesis. It is particularly interesting (in view of the
failure of graft breakdown) that the immature forms do not gain a predominance.
