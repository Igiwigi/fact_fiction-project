The primary wood consists of
groups of centripetally developed xylem, either quite free from one another laterally,
or, as Sotms{ has shown, united in groups as continuous strands for some little
distance. The leaf-traces are also diploxylie, the secondary wood being well developed. Yet S. spinulosa agrees with S. scutellata in the fact that the secondary xylem
is less clearly differentiated into bundles than in S. Menardi, and in the form of the
elements of the primary and secondary wood. In S. spinulosa, as in S.
