So far, I have simply assumed that any efforts or sacrifices by current
generations could be fairly shared internationally. Is this actually true? Two entirely independent
considerations, one of principle and one of fact, strongly support the hypothesis that ambitious
mitigation and ambitious poverty eradication can be fully compatible. With regard to principle, an admittedly now-dated study is still highly suggestive [25]. It
seems reasonable that those individuals whose emissions are the greatest, whatever their country,
should be the first to reduce their emissions (or, alternatively, pay for emissions reductions of the
same amount by others).
