be quite different from the order determined in other ways, but owing to the empirical
nature of the tests it is often difficult to explain why anomalies occur. Results in accordance
with each other are, however, obtained in many cases.

Progress in synthetic organic chemistry has increased the range of possible explosives to
such an extent that some more scientific information on sensitiveness would be most useful
in orienting future developments. Various developments in the experimental knowledge
on the subject are discussed in the following sections.

The mechanism of initiation of detonation

In discussing the initiation of detonation in a quiescent explosive it is desirable to keep
in view certain facts about the mechanism of propagation, once detonation has been started.
The linear velocity of propagation in solids and liquids ranges from 3000 to 8000 m./sec.,
so that the front of the chemical reaction traverses a layer of quiescent molecules—say
3 Angstrom units—in not more than 10~'’sec. At ordinary temperatures, the frequency of
molecular collision in a liquid is only about 3x10!" per sec. (Moelwyn-Hughes 1933).
During the time the front of the detonation has advanced the distance of one layer of mole-
cules, these molecules will not have performed more than 3 x 10-? collisions amongst them-
selves. It is highly unlikely that this layer of molecules will have time to be activated by
collisions amongst themselves, even though the temperature of the layer is rising by con-
duction and radiation from the gases behind the detonation front.

In view of the brief time available for chemical reaction, the most plausible mechanism
for the propagation of detonation seems to be that collisions with molecules. behind the
