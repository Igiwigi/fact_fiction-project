is equal to I for all values of =; as a consequence of making 7 0 in (55), and using (54)
und (56), we find that the integral equation for the determination of (4) is

We are led from the considerations of Section 4 to expeot that a solution of the above
equation can be found, In fact, it oan be shown as a particular ease of a general contour
integral that, for unrestricted values of y, positive or negative, (z > 0),

On comparing (57) and (58), we see that ¢ (A) is at once determined, and equation (1)
