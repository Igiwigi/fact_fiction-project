The mean index is 31°1, with a variation of + 2°9 and — 4, In the Neandertal
group the mean index is 40°8, with a variation of + 374 in the Neandertal calotte
and — 6:4 in Spy I. Prognathism.—The doubts sometimes expressed as to the value of this character
are probably due to the fact that attention has often been directed too exclusively
to its angular measurement, an element which requires to be supplemented by a
linear quantity, such as the alveolar index or the length of the face, to give a
complete account of the projection of the upper jaw. To secure consistency in
nomenclature it would be well to restrict the term “ orthognathous ” to those few
skulls which really are so, and to regard all others as prognathous. The
prognathism may be most simply measured by two factors: first the divergence of
the angle made by the nasi-prosthenion line with the Frankfort line from a right
angle, z.e., the complement of the Frankfort angle, and next by the length of the
intercept made on the line pr. a parallel to the Frankfort line by the nasi-prosthenion
line and the perpendicular dropped on to pr. a from the nasion,

The relation of the prosthenion to the other points on the sagittal section is most
clearly expressed by the system of polar co-ordinates, and the prognathism may be
most simply measured on this system by drawing a line parallel to the initial
line (cb) through the nasion and dropping a perpendicular from the prosthenion to
intersect it at a point a (fig. 14); the angle pr.va, which is the angle made by the
line pr. v with the initial line, represents the angular, and the length pr. a the linear
