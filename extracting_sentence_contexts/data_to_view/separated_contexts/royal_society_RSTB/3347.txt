B. Parathyroid.—The parathyroid in the pigeon differs strikingly in its general
appearance from the corresponding structure in other animals. But this difference
appears to be simply due to the fact that the epithelial cells contain an abundance of
fat, and that they become extensively vacuolated during the process of preparation
for the microscope. Unlike the parathyroids of reptiles, those of birds appear to
have no lumen in the masses of cells (Plate 12, fig. 11, pthyr.).

y. Post-branchial body.—In close relationship with, and in the same region as, the
parathyroid we find a body having an extraordinarily complicated structure.
