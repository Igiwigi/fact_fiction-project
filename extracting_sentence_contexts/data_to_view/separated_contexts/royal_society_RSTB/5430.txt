A single fold develops over the mouth invagination, called by them the “ Vorder-
darmfalte.’” This obviously corresponds to what I have called epipharynx in Pieris. It is a single structure at all times, and lateral to and in front of it develop the labral
lobes. These authors’ figures show a fusion between it and the labral lobes, though they
do not mention the fact. In Chalicodoma it is obviously non-appendicular, and if
homologous with the epipharynx in Pieris affords further evidence for my view that this
does not indicate a further head segment. Though the evidence in Pieris is in favour of regarding the labral lobes as appendages
.of the first head segment it must be borne in mind that the labrum has not a bifid origin
in all insects.
