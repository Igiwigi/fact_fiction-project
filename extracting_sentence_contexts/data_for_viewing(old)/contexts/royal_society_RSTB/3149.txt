DEVELOPMENT OF LARVAL NEPHRIDIA. 215

This is borne out in Polygordius by its totally different origin from the
ecelomesoblast, and from its arising at a much earlier date. It is present before the
coelomesoblast has appeared, both in Polygordius and Hupomatus, as well as in such
forms as Echiurus and Criodrilus, There are a number of Annelids in which its
genetic history is somewhat obscure, as in Nereis, and cases like Capitella in which
it would seem to arise in a manner different from other forms; these apparent
exceptions are not sufficient to outweigh all the evidence, however, in favour of its
conception as a structure distinct from the ccelomesoblast. I hope to show, in
subsequent papers, that this conception of the mesenchyme, forming as it does an
essential part of Mryerâ€™s gonoccel theory, explains satisfactorily many anomalous
facts concerning the nephridia, almost inexplicable on any other hypothesis. The
general mass of embryological evidence of the past few years seems to be directly in
favour of this view, and fresh evidence from day to day seems only to strengthen its
position. I hope, however, to return to this subject in my final paper, when the
facts presented by a number of forms can be properly examined at length and
compared.

6. The Early Development of the Nephridia.

The rudiments of the nephridia are first distinguishable as two cells on the
ventral plate of the ectoderm, lateral and anterior to the anus, as already mentioned.
They soon move forwards and outwards, taking up a position midway between
mouth and anus (fig. 13). From the ectoderm cells among which they lie they are
