Thus, we can conclude that the charges, which create the
particle electric field in the air, are negative. A detailed theoretical description of the interaction
of charged colloid particles at air/water and oil/water interfaces with an external electric field in
the non-polar fluid (air, oil) can be found in [25]. The interparticle distances in the monolayer at a given degree of compression indicate that
the surface charge acquired by the particles in different hydrophobization runs is not perfectly
reproducible, despite the fact that we are following exactly the same experimental procedure. For this reason, in a given series of experiments with the Langmuir trough, we used particles
from the same batch for a period of less than one week. For longer storage in IPA, a pronounced
decrease of the particle charge is observed.
