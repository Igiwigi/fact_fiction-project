Until more complete experi-
mental data are available the question of the success or failure of the diffraction
theory must remain open. However this question may ultimately be settled, the discussion shows that it is
impossible to accept the hypothesis that the law of decrease of the forces of the
electromagnetic field with increasing distance is a combination of the law of spherical
divergence with a law of absorption, expressed by an attenuation factor of exponential
type. However closely such a law may represent the facts it can have no value
except as an empirical formula. In particular, it is not admissible to draw from it
any inference as to the amount of absorption. Independently of any absorption which
may exist, there must be a law of diffraction expressing attenuation of the field on
account of the curvature of the earthâ€™s surface; and the type of attenuation factor
required to express the effect of curvature would not differ much from the exponential
type in a moderate range of great distances.
