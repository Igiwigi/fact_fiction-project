A problem dual to (2.7), given by maxi-minimizing the Lagrangian,
inherits the separable structure present in the Lagrangian. Specifically, the dual problem is defined
as

max {6@2):2€R"}, (3.1)

where

(A) = min {L(p, u, A): (pj, ui) € Qj,i€ M}
=.'D in Li(p;,uj,a). 2

The partial dual functions 6;(A) = min, L;(pi, ui, 4) in the summation are the negative of the

margin maximization problems (2.5), written with 7 = A:

max 2'p; — GCost;(pj;, u;)

Accordingly, a dual price also solves the minimization problem below

max 0(A) = max { A'D — Mm*(A) } = — min M™*(A) — TD

This characterization of the dual price as the one minimizing the discrepancy between the
expectation of best margin from the agents and the total payment they receive. In turn, the
payment is related to the margins seen by the ISO in (2.4), so the dual problem is in fact
minimizing the differences (2.6). These relations justify the naming of minimal uplift that is
associated with the dual prices in [8], also called convex-hull prices in the electric engineering
literature. When there is no discrepancy, the minimal uplifts are all null and in the optimization
jargon it is said that there is no duality gap.
