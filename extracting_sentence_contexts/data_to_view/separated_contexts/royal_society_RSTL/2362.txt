cularly one seen on the 29th of March, 1826. By Joan Dartzon, F.R.S.

APPREHENDING that the Royal Society will favourably receive accounts
that have a direct tendency to determine the height of that interesting phazno-
menon, the Aurora borealis, I haye been induced to transmit some observyations
that were made upon a very Temarkable one, which appeared in the evening
of the 29th of March, 1826. From some recent observations, an opinion
seems to be entertained by some writers, that the aurora is not s0 high as has
generally been estimated ; but it is only from facts and observations such as
the following, I conceive, that any near approximation to the true height can
be obtained. The aurora borealis above mentioned, was of a kind very rarely occurring. It assumed the appearance of a rainbow-like arch, stretching across the mid-
heaven, at right angles to the magnetic meridian.
