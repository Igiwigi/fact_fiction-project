Its basal body-wall was pulled up and tucked in at the sides, but curled
loosely round the whorl of tentacles, and so far hooded the polyp when the tentacles
were retracted. In every tuck calcareous cell-deposit gathered here and there, just as it did in the
basal disc. The primitive “septal trabecule” and “spines” thus formed, were
therefore continuous with the epitheca, and, in fact, between adjacent “ septal” tucks,
the ectoderm continued actively depositing epitheca. If the curls and wrinkles of the peripheral ring of the body-wall were particularly
loose, it might easily happen, with further growth, that only the innermost wrinkle
kept up the original connection with the septa, while the outer wrinkles became more
variable. Thus the inner part would be differentiated as a theca, and would be
protected by the less regular deposit of the further wall-wrinkles.
