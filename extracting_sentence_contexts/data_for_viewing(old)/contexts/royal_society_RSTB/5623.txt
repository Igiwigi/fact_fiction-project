the majority produce amounts of volatile acids which, while small in themselves, are
well above the average for the majority of species of Aspergillus. The outstanding
features of this group are, however, (a) the production of volatile neutral compounds
(alcohol) and, in consequence, high respiration coefficients; and (b) the production
of kojic acid.

(a) The production of alcohol by certain members of the A. flavus-oryz@ group is, of
course, well known, since strains of A. oryz@ have long been used in Japan in the
manufacture of alcoholic liquors. It is interesting, however, to find that this character-
istic persists throughout both groups although, of course, it is less marked in some species
than in others. The A. ochraceus and the A. flavus-oryze@ groups are closely allied
biochemically to the A. niger group, but are sharply marked off from the last group
by the fact that, whereas they produce relatively small amounts of titratable acid, the
A. niger group gives rise to considerable quantities.

(6) The production of kojic acid by members of this group has been examined in detail
and is reported in Part VII. It may be mentioned, however, that, of the species of this
group in our possession, A. parasiticus Spearn, Ac. 14, gives the best yields of kojic
acid (16-20 per cent.). This is indicated in the balance sheets given in Table XIII,
in which A. parasiticus has the highest figure for “ carbon unaccounted for ” (0-659 =
19-1 per cent. of the glucose utilised) since kojic acid is included in the type of carbon
compounds classed as “ carbon unaccounted for.” Reference may also be made to the
large difference between the figures for glucose by polarimeter (0-79 per cent.) and
glucose by alkaline iodine (2-29 per cent.).
