(1.) Introductory. Iv is a curious fact that although our knowledge of the structure of the finest
spectrum lines may now be said to rest on a secure theoretical and experimental
basis, little is known of the distribution of energy in the broadened spectrum lines
which are produced under certain conditions of excitation, or the exact circumstances
which control their broadening.. The researches of Lord Ray.eiau,* Micnerson,t
Buisson and Fasry,{ and others have shown that in gases at low pressures, when
excited by uncondensed electric discharges, the width of the spectrum lines emitted
can be accounted for completely and satisfactorily by the translatory motion of the
