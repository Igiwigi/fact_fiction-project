position in which the first ruling of one of these location signals was adjusted between
the parallel pair of spider-lines to that in which the fifth ruling was similarly
adjusted—the microscope having thus travelled over four wave-length spaces— exactly
eight interference bands (each corresponding to half a wave-length, 77479 inch) in
red hydrogen light passed over the reference spot; this was true however many
times, and in whichever direction, the traverse was performed, and was precisely the
number expected within a very small fraction, if the rulings were truly spaced zodo0
of an inch apart.

Thus the interval between two lines ruled ggtpp inch apart corresponds to the
passage of two interference bands in red hydrogen or cadmium light, past the reference
spot in the centre of the field of view of the interferometer telescope, a very con-
venient fact. The lines themselves are almost as sharp as the spider-lines of the eye-
piece micrometer, and there is no trace of roughness of edge; they are also narrower
than the white interspaces between the lines, so that the width of a line is less than
half a wave-length,

With the j;-inch dry objectives, specially constructed under the direction of
Mr. Conrad Beck, the resolution is excellent, and the working distance so relatively
great for so high a power as to leave a clearly visible air film between the cover glass
and the objective, quite a safe working distance, in fact, for all traversing and .
adjusting purposes. With an oil immersion objective of the same power the definition
is simply surprising.

The lines at 60,000 to the inch are not so satisfactorily resolvable without an
