The apex process
may bifurcate close to the cell, giving the latter the form of a horned pyramid, or it
may divide into two secondary processes of equal diameter at any distance up the third
layer. The apex process is particularly coarse and does not undergo rapid attenuation. The average dimensions of these cells is 46 X 11p, a meagurement which reveals
clearly the elongated conformation of these elements, in fact, the oval and plump
rounded contour 80 frequent in the corresponding cells of Man, the Monkey, and
the Carnivora is very rarely met with in these animals. Occasionally a larger cell
than usual is met with, e.9., 65p X 23p. They contain an oval nucleus measuring
13p in length.
