This enhancement of properties
is ascribed to the larger field dependence of Tc and lower latent heat of this material compared
with Mn-Fe-P-Si. Furthermore, the mechanical integrity of this compound was reported to be
optimized to a point where no breaking or cracking of the samples could be observed, even after
10000 cycles of magnetization and demagnetization [101]. This improvement in the structural
integrity was ascribed to the fact that there is no discontinuous volume change present when
passing through the transition but a comparable change in the a/c lattice parameters of the base
Mn-Fe-P-Si compound is preserved. It was also shown that the B-containing compounds Mn,Feq 95~x)P(1—y—z)SizBy are highly
tuneable while preserving the giant MCE with a limited thermal hysteresis in a broad temperature
range [58]. Very recent works show that boron can also be substituted by nitrogen, possibly
increasing the industrial applicability of this compound [102].
