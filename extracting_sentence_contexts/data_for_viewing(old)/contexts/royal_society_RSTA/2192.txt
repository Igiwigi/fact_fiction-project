Definition 4.2. A configuration is 4-balanced in R* if there is a 4 x 4 antisymmetric matrix A
such that, for all j=1...n,
V;U(q) = —mjA? qj.

Specifically, a configuration is 4-balanced if and only if is the base point of a relative
equilibrium solution with group velocity given by A in the above definition, i.e. @ = A.
Another definition introduced in [11] and reproduced in [14] is:

Definition 4.3. A central configuration is an arrangement of the n-point masses whose
configuration vector satisfies VU(q) + AMq = 0 for some real constant A.

This is clearly a special case of the relative equilibrium condition (4.11), with @* = Aly. In fact,
as we note below, for @ = (@1,@2) € SO(2)xy x SO(2)zw, we have = diag(—ot, -o, -0, —w%).
Thus, qo is a central configuration if and only if qo is a relative equilibrium with group velocity
@ = (,) with —w? =A.

(c) Collinear relative equilibria
An n-point collinear configuration, for some n > 1, is one satisfying
qj =Aj40, (4.12)

for some Aj #0 for every j =1,2,...,n, all distinct, and qo € R}, qo £0.
Recall the relative equilibrium condition (4.11):

Vvj;U(q) = = mje qj for allj=1...n.
