The very case pro-
posed in the objection, of a $lip of plain glass laid on a sphe-
rical surface, has been examined in the most simple form
possible, by using for the spherical curvature, a piece of
polished metal, to exclude all adventitious source of the ge-
neration of colours, and employing for the contact of a plain
surface, the base of a prism, on the inside of which, according
to the NEwrToNnIan doctrine of the different reflexibility of
light, it must be admitted, the colours will be critically sepa-
rated. Then, without the least change of form, or contact of
the two essential surfaces, it has been proved, that a diminu-
tion of the prismatic angle, will gradually extend the visibility
of the rings, till, even before that angle comes to a vanishing
state, where the prism would be converted into a plain slip of
glass, the rings may be seen in every direction, and at any
elevation of the eye, in which they can be seen, through a slip
of glass such as the objection supposes. As this then has been
proved not only of rings, but of all other possible configura-
tions, that may be caused by the rays of the critically separated
colours, modified by reflection or radiation from curved sur-
faces, it is evident, that an objection which asserts that such
colours cannot be seen, contradicts the plainest and best
established facts. With regard to the actual course of the rays from the very
moment of their critical separation into colours, till they pro-
duce the required effect, it cannot surely be expected that I
should trace them through a most intricate complication of
reflections from curve to curve, when it has been shown, in
the second part of my paper, that even with streaks, which

are produced by the contact of two plain surfaces, it would be
an endless undertaking to follow them till they enter the
eye. Enough has already been said upon this subject to con-
vince every intelligent reader, that all the phenomena of
coloured rings, which have been ascribed to the effect of cer-
tain fits of easy reflection and easy transmission of the rays
of light, as well as the great variety of other coloured ap-
pearances of which I have treated, admit of a most satisfactory
solution, by substituting the solid principle of the critical
Separation of the different colours in the room of these fits.
