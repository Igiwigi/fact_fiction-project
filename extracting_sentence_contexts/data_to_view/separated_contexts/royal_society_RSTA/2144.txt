We shall adopt a semi-geometrical point of view. In the classical discussion of vibrations about equilibrium, the infinitesimal quadric,

(7.69) V,,, dq" dq" = constant,

plays a fundamental part. In fact, it is necessary and sufficient for stability that this
quadric should be of the closed (or ellipsoidal) type, the independent normal vibrations

there is a corresponding quadric of importance to which we shall now proceed.
