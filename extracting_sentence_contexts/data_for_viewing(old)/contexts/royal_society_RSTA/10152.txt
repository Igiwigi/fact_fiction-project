for the McGill University, Montreal, and to avoid the uncertainty as to leakage
between adjacent turns of such a spiralf the arrangement devised by one of the
authors (W. E. A.) of having double-threaded screw grooves wound with separate
bare wires, subsequently connected in series after the insulation resistance between
them had been made satisfactory, was adopted.

Experience with the preliminary apparatus showed that air convection currents
should be minimised, and that easy access to, and independent adjustments of, both
fixed and suspended coils were very desirable. In designing the new current weigher,
in collaboration with the late Professor Jones, these points were kept in view, and
the arrangements chosen were such as would take full advantage of the mechanical
precision attainable with modern machine tools, a subject which Professor Jonus had
very much at heart. In fact, he had long advocated that the instruments employed
in realising the concrete values of the electrical units from their absolute definitions
should be engineering tools rather than ordinary physical laboratory apparatus.

Complete working drawings and specifications of the proposed instrument, and its
adjustable support, were prepared at the Central Technical College during the Session
1898-99, the drawings being made by Mr. J. P. Gregory, then a student of the
College, and now of the British Thomson Houston Co., Rugby. Tenders were
obtained for the construction of the instrument, to defray the cost of which the
British Association for the Advancement of Science made a grant of Â£300.{

As the amounts of the tenders for the balance, and the adjustable phosphor-bronze
stand for supporting it, much exceeded the above-named sum, Sir ANDREW NoBLe,
