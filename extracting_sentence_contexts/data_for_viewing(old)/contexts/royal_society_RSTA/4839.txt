holomorphically continued. (Furthermore, {Re(s) > D} is the largest such half-plane in which the
series an G is convergent or, equivalently, absolutely convergent; e.g. [22, §VI.3].) It follows, in
particular, that we must always have D C {Re(s) < D}. If, in addition, ¢¢ can be meromorphically
extended to an open neighbourhood of D, then Dé D and D=max{Re(s):w € D}. Here and
thereafter, we (often) use the short-hand notation {Re(s) > a} :={s € C: Re(s) > a}. Similarly, if
a €R, {Re(s) =a@} stands for the vertical line {s € C: Re(s) =a}; and analogously for the vertical
strip {w < Re(s) < 6}, witha <p.


Our aim here is not to provide a complete description of the theory of complex dimensions
[5-7] (and especially [7]). Instead, we just provide a few examples and results. In the present
exposition, we reverse the chronological order as the results from [1-4] (§3) were obtained before
the rigorous theory of complex dimensions [5-7], and in fact (along with the work in [13-15,31],
in particular) provide a natural heuristic and mathematical motivation for it.

Let £=CS be the Cantor string; it is associated with the bounded open set 2 C R defined as
the complement in [0,1] of the classic (ternary) Cantor set C. Note that 2 is merely the union
of the sequence of disjoint open intervals (the ‘middle thirds’) which are deleted in the standard
construction of C. So that £ is given by the sequence of lengths 1, 4, i, y y y yr .-,or 37"
repeated with multiplicity 2” -! for n=1,2,3,.... Hence, fc has a meromorphic continuation to
all C given by ¢¢(s) =3°*/(1 — 2.3-*), for all s € C. It follows that the set of complex dimensions
of C (or, equivalently, of the Cantor set C=@Q) is given by Des = {D+ inp:n €Z}, where
i:=V-1, D= log; 2 is the Minkowski dimension of CS (or, equivalently, of C) and p := 277/ log,
is the oscillatory period of CS. Here and in the sequel, we let Z:= {0, +1, +2,...}.
