The relations existing between the swn's altitude and the mean monthly chemical
intensities are graphically represented (for 1865) in fig. 2, Plate XXT.; and (for 1866) in
fig. 3, Plate XXI. The ordinates denote the intensity, and the absciss the correspond-
ing altitude of the sun.

From the yariation in direction of the straight lines representing the relation of inten-
sity to altitude for the different months, it is clear that in each month a different yalue
exists for the constant, of the formula, which in fact represents the degree of atmo-
sPheric opalescence, the amount of cloud, and the various other factors which, in addi-
tion to the sun's altitude, influence the chemical intensity.

That the simple relation which has been shown to hold good when the sun has
reached a certain altitude does not apply in the case of low altitudes, is distinctly een
from the aboye-mentioned figures. When the swn is only a few degrees aboye the

n, the disturbing phenomena of opalescence come into play, and the values of the
er and yet undetermined terms of the expression become $80 large as materially to
