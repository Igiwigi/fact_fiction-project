On the other hand, the distribu-
tion of pelargonidin appears to be associated with climatic rather than morphological
distinctions. Nearly all the plants examined whose flowers contain pelargonidin
derivatives originate from tropical or subtropical countries. This observation is interest-
ing in view of the fact that blue (generally delphinidin) is considered to be the
predominating colour in alpine flora (Cockerell 1891). Flower-colour type may also
be controlled by the preference of insects for certain colours. For example, bees are
said to be insensitive to red (von Frisch 1937)

ANALYSES OF GLYCOSIDAL TYPES

(1) The majority of anthocyanins are either 3-monosides or 3 ; 5-dimonosides, The
relative numbers in which these are found are dependent upon the nature of the
anthocyanidin.
