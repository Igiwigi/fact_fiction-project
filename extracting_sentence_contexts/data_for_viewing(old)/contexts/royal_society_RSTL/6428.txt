ON THE FORMATION OF THE EGG IN THE ANNULOSA. 617

reminded me of the sacculated organ, and had all the appearance of being in an
intermediate condition,
T1 am only too well aware that my obseryations have not yet gone far enough to justify
any definite conclusions, but they seem to indicate that the eggs of Chetlifer* are in
er carried about by the animal, that the young ones in this position grow to 80me
$ize, being nourished by a milky fluid secreted for that purpose by a special organ, but
that, when winter comes on, the eggs are laid by the mother in some secure place, and
erhaps do not hatch until the warm days of spring. Furthermore, the fact that each
female Chetifer produces thirty-five to forty eggs in a brood, while the egg-bearing
imens have only seventeen or eighteen eggs attached to them, and that while these
Specimens, which I may perhaps be permitted to call *nurses” (though in a natural, and
mot a Steenstruppian sense), have the absent or at least rudimentary ovary or testis,
She ordinary specimens do not possess the peculiar sacculated © milk-gland,” would seem
So indicate (though I dare not do more than suggest the possibility) that in Chelifer, as
Sn & many Hymenoptera, we have, besides the males and females, certain s0-called
Deuter specimens which are (probably in this case also) females with imperfect gene-
ye organs, and whose function it is less to lay eggs themselves, than to feed and tend
|. young ones produced by the perfect females.
Z In September the males of Chelifer seem to be about as numerous as the females; out
the last sixteen specimens which I examined, eight were males, and eight were females.
