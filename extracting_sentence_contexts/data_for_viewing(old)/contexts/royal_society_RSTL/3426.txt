light striz, between which the real margin of the fibrille recedes from it, with an
intervening fluid. Now in this specimen the interior of the fasciculus is in focus ; a
central row of corpuscles is there een, and the view of the margin thus represented
is, in fact, such as would be obtained by a horizontal section. This fasciculus is thus
proved to present on its surface a series of transverse grooves, to which the sheath
does not adhere, and in which a fluid is collected. It seems doubtful whether the
attachment of the sarcolemma to the prominence of the snccessiye discs be 80 com-
plete as to isolate the intervening grooves from one another.

Another evidence of this adhesion is the following : when the herniz are formed
as above mentioned, it is of course 80 far destroyed. Now, the intumescence is oc-
casionally 80 great, that the sarcolemma is rent extensively on all sides, and fragments
of it only remain, not embracing the whole fasciculus. Wherever the fibrillze have
detached themselves from the sheath they bulge freely, but where they continue to
adhere to its remnants, they are confined and constricted, and the striz cannot
expand (fig. 46.). This adhesion will afford an explanation of an appearance that for
