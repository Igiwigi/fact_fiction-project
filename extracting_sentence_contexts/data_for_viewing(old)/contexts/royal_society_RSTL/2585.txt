MR. BELL ON THE NERVES OF THE FACE. 321

Such are a few of the facts which have been reaped from a patient reliance
on the correctness of my first deductions, and I would now urge them in proof
of the importance of reasoning upon the anatomy. All these nerves have been
repeatedly divided, by almost every surgeon of eminence in the three kingdoms.
Although some have performed the operation of dividing the nerves frequently,
and one eminent gentleman had done it six times on the face of the same man,
all these operations have been performed without giving rise to the suspicion
that these nerves bestowed different properties. Even now, 80 slow is the
progress of improvement, it is stated by a surgeon that he will not hesitate to
cut the portio dura in the case of tic douloureux. My duty is performed when
I give publicity to the facts which prove that horrible distortion of the whole
countenance, the loss of distinct articulation, the loss of expression, the loss
of motion of the eyelids, and consequent inflammation of the eye, must follow
such an operation. .

Much has been said in favour of experiments when made by men who are
positively without any expectation of the result, or, as they affirm, are unbiassed.
The only instances of this that I can allow, are when the surgeon cuts the
nerves of the face in a surgical operation. In s8uch operations as these for tic
douloureux;, he is indeed unbiassed ; and we have seen the result, that after fifty
years of such experience we remained quite ignorant of the distinctions in
these nerves. But on the other hand when attention is roused to inquiry by
aantomy, facts are obtained of the utmost importance both to the knowledge
