Spooner and Bawden (1935) have shown that the X virus acts as an antigen in the
rabbit, and the presence of strains is readily demonstrated by precipitin and comple-
ment fixation tests. They have independently examined sap from plants which, though
perfectly healthy in appearance, were suspected of being infected with the X” strain
and were able to prove its presence by the precipitin reaction. Bawden has lately called the writer’s attention to the fact that sap from X” infected
tobacco plants which in Cambridge were completely symptomless, used as inoculum
on healthy tobacco plants raised in the experimental insect-free glasshouses of Roth-
amsted has induced on some plants a slight but just visible mottle. This may more
reasonably be explained on the basis of difference of environment and genetic con-
stitution of the test plants used, than on any real change in the nature of the virus
strain itself. The reactions of this and the remaining strains on various members of the Solan-
aceae are recorded in Table II, p. 144.
