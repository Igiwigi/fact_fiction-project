and therefore its vanishing expresses the condition that some one of the quadrics of the
s9stem AU +pU'+»U" shall be a perfect square ; or geometrically, it expxesses the con-
dition that it shall be possible, through the intersection of two conics of the system, to
draw a conic having double contact with the third. In this case the Jacobian of the
system breaks up into a right line and conic.
