the time-varying nature of the signals analysed. The simplest time-frequency method is the short-
time Fourier transform (STFT). Comparing the signal being analysed with elementary functions
that are localized in the time and frequency domains is the basic idea behind the method. The


wavelet transform (WT) is another well-known time-scale method, having the same concept as
the STFT. The major difference between the two methods is in the different basis /elementary
functions chosen during the process that lead to different signal representations. Because
of that, wavelets give better localization properties at high frequencies and are useful for
detecting local events in the signals. Wavelet analysis is probably the most popular technique;
a review of condition monitoring applications is found in reference [18]. In terms of an online
implementation, the application of time-scale methods is less costly than a fast Fourier transform
(FFT). In fact, the discrete wavelet transform can be carried out in O(N) operations compared with
O(N logN) for the FFT. Some examples of WT applications in condition monitoring are given
in [19-23].

Other common time-frequency methods are Cohen class time-frequency distributions such as
the Wigner-Ville (WVD) and the Choiâ€”Williams (CWD) distributions. The energy distribution

in the joint time-frequency domain, such as the WVD, is very complicated as the underlying : =
transforms are nonlinear. Condition monitoring applications of the WVD can be found in : yy

Relatively recently, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method has also been proposed aes
[28] as a filter bank method that can be applied for time-frequency analysis in combination with 22
