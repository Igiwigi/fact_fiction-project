presence, subaerial rock slides have long been recognized as tsunami sources, and studies at least
go back to Wiegel 1955 [4]. Submarine landslide tsunamis, however, were not fully recognized
prior to the 1998 Papua New Guinea (PNG) event [5]. This was despite clear tsunami evidence
from events such as the 1929 Grand Banks tsunami [6,7], the 1979 Nice tsunami [8], as well as
the 8150 BP Storegga landslide tsunami [9,10]. In fact, the PNG event gave rise to a scientific
dispute, eventually leading to a general acceptance that the tsunami was due to a slump source
[11,12]. Past investigations may consequently not fully recognize submarine landslides as possible
triggers, and particularly older historical records are therefore likely to be biased [3].

Tsunamis induced by landslides display a greater variety depending on their origin compared
with earthquakes. Sources range from events of local character [13-15], to large-volume landslides
with long run-out and substantial regional impact [16,17]. Generation mechanisms are also more
diverse, spanning from impulsive waves due to subaerial landslides hitting the water with high

impact velocities (e.g. [18-20]) to submerged landslides moving farther but at lower speeds (e.g. : =
[21]). The dating of older events represents another challenge [22], and complicates the use of : yy
landslide statistics for estimating the landslide-induced tsunami hazard (e.g. [22,23]). Owing to 2
