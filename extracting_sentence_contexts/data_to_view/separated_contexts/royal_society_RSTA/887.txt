The separation of geoid and compensated geoid is easily calculated when the
topography is known.* The reduction of gravity observations, including compen-
sation according to the Hayrorp hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that
many gravity results have already been so reduced makes it convenient to adopt this
form of compensation. For the present purpose, in addition a height correction
for the amount of separation of the geoid (from which heights of pendulum stations
are ordinarily given) and compensated geoid is required ; for our data are to be
applied to the compensated geoid. The height correction in all cases may be derived
best by means of equation (17.4)
