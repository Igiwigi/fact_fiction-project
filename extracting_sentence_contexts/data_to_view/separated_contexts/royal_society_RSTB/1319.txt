It has been stated that the rounded nuclei have not been observed in the termins
chambers, but this is not the case with the strands. Though in the majority of cases
these are most abundant in the chambers in which the rounded nuclei lie, in other
they are found in the terminal chambers, and in one specimen they are seen to be
closely massed in the terminal chamber. To repeat, the facts which the preparations show are these :â€”
1, The irregular strands may be seen continuous with the rounded nuclei.
2. In a single specimen all transitions are found between the rounded nuclei a
the irregular strands.
3. While in some specimens, and especially young ones, only rounded nuclei a
present and no strands, in others the reverse is the case, only strands being prese
and no nuclei.
