defence systems is intrinsically intertwined with the evolution
of the selfish genetic elements. The link between the two is not
limited to the obvious effects of the arms race but also involves
perpetual exchange of components. As discussed above, MGE
appear to have played key roles in several major evolutionary
transitions and this involvement is in large part realized
through the evolution of defence systems.

6. Concluding remarks

The biosphere is literally dominated by viruses and other MGE.
Emergence of parasites is an inherent property of replicator
systems. These two facts predicate the multiple and essential
roles of MGE in the evolution of life. Here, I identify specific
contributions of selfish elements to the major evolutionary
transitions. Such contributions come in two forms: the arms
race that triggers major innovations in cellular life forms
(hosts of the selfish elements) and direct recruitment of parts
of selfish elements for key cellular functions. At the core of
each evolutionary transition is the emergence of a new level
of cooperation between biological entities and hence of a new
level of selection (figure 1). One of the key driving forces in
the evolution of cooperation—and of compartmentalization
that precedes and facilitates the emergence of collectives—is
defence against parasites. An ensemble can make use of mech-
