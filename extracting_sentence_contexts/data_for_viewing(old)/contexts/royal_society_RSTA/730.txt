frequently observed and a modified two-lobed mode can occur as a solution to the model
equations. However, a finite perturbation is required to achieve it, as shown in the finite-element
calculations [18] and complementary experiments [19], which included the effects of friction. In
contrast to the unconstrained ring, the buckled state in the constrained problem does not arise at
a pitchfork bifurcation from the circular state. Instead, the branch corresponding to the buckled
state is disconnected from the trivial branch, and it is bounded by a saddle-node bifurcation, i.e.

a stable and unstable pair of branches meet at the saddle-node near the undeformed value of : 8

This relatively simple system is a didactic example in which the base state is linearly stable, : =
but there exists an alternative state that is observed in experiments under finite perturbation. In : S
fact, Chan & McMinn showed that the buckled state becomes exponentially close to the base state 2
as the radius of the confining ring decreases. Thus, eventually the imperfections in the system aed
are enough to force the buckled state. The situation is not the same as the classic imperfection 22
sensitivity of thin-walled shells under pressure loading [20]. In this case, there are bifurcations : Ss
from the trivial state, but the bifurcations are subcritical, which means that small imperfections DNS
can induce buckled states at much lower loads than in the perfect system. Despite these theoretical : 5
differences, however, the practical consequences will be the same, and it would not be possible to 8

identify the difference between the two solution structures from experiments alone.

In this paper, we consider a series of novel constrained buckling problems in which the
symmetry of the external confiner is modified from a continuous to a discrete group. We replace
the circle by a regular n-gon with n > 2. In this case, we find that generically the system undergoes
