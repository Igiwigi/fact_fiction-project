The liver behaved precisely as if the
animal had been snddenly killed in its ordinary state, sngar being found, after an ordi-
narily conducted examination, to its usual extent. Tt has also not escaped the observation of BERNARD, in experimenting on the frog,
that, according to the temperature of the animal at the time of death, the liver is found
with or without sugar after an ordinarily conducted examination. In the Â© Comptes
Rendus' of the Academy of Sciences, March 1857, he mentions this fact, and refers it to
a variation in the activity of the circulation, produced by the high and low temperature
leading to an increase or decrease, or even arrest of the glycogenic function. IT had
obtained results corresponding with those of BERNARD before I was aware he had under-
taken his experiments. Frogs in good condition, in which the liver is large, pale-
coloured, and exceedingly rich in amyloid substance, were exposed for two hours to an
atmosphere heated to 90% An examination of the livers in the usual way afforded a
decided indication of the presence of sugar.
