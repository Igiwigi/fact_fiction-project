Error bars are the s.e.m. of 10 runs of the simulation per set of conditions,
each consisting of 1000 decodes of random locations. Figure 4a shows the decoding error for the grid system, pattern. In fact, the true optimum is likely to be even smaller
for two levels of uncertainty, as a function of the grid scale than that observed here. Our estimate was limited by the
expansion factor in the range 0.125â€”7. For both levels of range examined, and expansion factors smaller than 0.125
uncertainty, small expansion factors lead to large decoding were not examined.
