(x 3.) The Bregma Inde«.—If a straight line be dropped from the bregma perpendicularly
upon the nasi-inion line, a point (a, fig. 1) is obtained which is the projection of
the bregma upon the base (der Lage des bregma, ScuHwa.se), its position may be
calculated from the fact that the intercept is the cosine of the calottal nasion angle,
but it is much simpler and sufficiently accurate to read off its length directly from
a profile drawing of the skull ;* thus in the Australian skull it measures 685 millims.,
in the Neandertal, 78 millims. in length. The bregma index is obtained by multiplying
the length of the intercept by 100 and dividing by the length of the nasi-inion line ;
thus in the case of the Neandertal skull we have 78 x 100/192 = 40°6, in that of the
Australian skull, 68°5 x 100/184 = 37°2.
