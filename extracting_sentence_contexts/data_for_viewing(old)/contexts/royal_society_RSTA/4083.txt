would take longer to decay; however, under the conditions used here, the amount of interface
generated becomes limiting.

We then studied the dissipation of BslA-stabilized bubbles under different solution conditions.
First, we measured the turbidity decay as a function of pH. Figure 2a shows the decay curves
obtained from these experiments. What is immediately notable is that pH has a strong influence
on the formation and stability of the air bubbles. Figure 2b plots both decay times and maximum
turbidity and shows that there is a peak in both observables at pH approximately 5.5. There is little
bubble stabilization at acidic and basic pHs. Monomeric BslA in solution has an isoelectric point
calculated to be 9.2. Therefore, it is curious that so little bubble stabilization occurs at basic pH
(7-9). We ascribe this behaviour to a shift in the pI of BsLA when bound to the air—water interface.
Indeed, the pI of HFBII was found to shift when adsorbed to an air bubble [31]. This pI change for
adsorbed HFBII is thought to arise from the fact that a large proportion of the protein is no longer
in contact with water, therefore only a fraction of the functional groups are ionizable. A shift in pI
was also observed for emulsion films stabilized by B-lactoglobulin [32,33]. In this case, the shift
was attributed to conformational changes that occur upon surface adsorption.

In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the ¢-potential of emulsion droplets stabilized by
BslA. We chose to measure emulsion droplets because they are extremely long lived thus avoiding
