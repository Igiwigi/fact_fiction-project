Subjects on an
8h dark schedule slept for about 7.5h (by polysomnogra-
phy), and their elevated night-time melatonin production
was limited to the dark phase, as expected. The same subjects
on a 14h dark period slept for an average of about 8.5h in
two episodes separated by a period of ‘quiet wakefulness’
in between. The term ‘quiet wakefulness’ reflects the fact
that in this laboratory setting, the subjects were required to
remain in bed in the dark. Melatonin production, however,
showed no dip in the middle of the night and remained
high for close to 12 h. Although dark is required for pineal
melatonin production, sleep is not.
