In addition, it is clear that the counter moral hazard argument could have been constructed
differently. In this study, the argument states that, although geoengineering may distract from
current policies, this is not in fact a moral hazard. An alternative—and arguably just as plausible—
counter-argument would be that, although reducing current commitments on mitigation would
be a negative outcome, geoengineering will not in fact cause this to happen. In other words,
geoengineering will coexist with existing policies, in the same way that adaptation now coexists
with mitigation. However, while there are undoubtedly multiple ways of conceiving of the moral hazard
argument, the contribution of this study is in beginning to quantify what public responses to
these may be.
