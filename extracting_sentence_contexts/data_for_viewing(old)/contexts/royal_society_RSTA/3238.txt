The fact that the renormalization group running scale jz gets a contribution from R leads to an
important result: curvature can influence the running of couplings.

A related and equally important curved space effect to curvature induced running is the
generation of the non-minimal term which couples the scalar curvature to the Higgs field ~ER¢”.
The expression for the effective potential (3.1) shows that we chose a non-minimal term to be


present already at tree-level, but from the quantum correction one may see that this is in fact
required by renormalization group running: the f-function for § can be determined from the
coefficients of the logarithms to be

from which it is apparent that § = 0 is not an fixed point of the renormalization group flow. From
this we can conclude that a non-zero & will always be generated by a change in the energy scale,
if from nothing else than from the inevitable change of the Hubble rate H during the evolution of
the universe.

The two modifications introduced by background curvature are most clearly visible when
