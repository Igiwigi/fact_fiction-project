representing the junction of the frontal and parietal bones in the middle line; and often
a difficulty would occur at the upper angle of the occipital bone from the presence of an
os triquetrum ; but this was usually solved by taking the point at which the limbs of
the lambdoidal suture would haye met had they passed up uninterruptedly. With regard

somewhat open suture was the point taken for measurement, in adult skulls the rough
line was chosen which seems to form the limit between the two bones. In fact the
writer supposed, in common with anatomists generally, that this line was the mark of
the obliterated suture, but afterwards, suspecting the accuracy of this view, made a
special examination and found that it was really the mark of attachment of the pharynx
to the sphenoid bone, and that the position of the spheno-occipital suture was slightly
further back, and disappeared without leaving any trace.

Besides the positions of the points on the skull already mentioned, it was necessary
that another should be registered to indicate the extent of the anterior cranial fossa.
For this purpose the outer edge of the foramen opticum was chosen, the needle being
rested on it as far up as possible. Tt is quite true that a point in the mesial section
would have been somewhat preferable to this, especially as the position of the foramen
opticum varies a little in height in its relation to the floor of the anterior cranial fossa,
