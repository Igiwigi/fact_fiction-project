972 PROFESSOR J. PRESTWICH ON THE EVIDENCES OF A SUBMERGENCE

This deposit is overlaid in places by a fine sandy bed, like “ Loess,” but in none of
the sections given by M. Gaupry is there the appearance of an overlying Rubble-
breccia or “head.” Only in three sections are breccias figured, and these are inland
and at no great height, lying at the foot of hills, whence the blocks they contain are
derived. The matrix is a marl derived also from the adjacent soft Tertiary strata.

Nor is any mention made of osseous breccias or of fissures with angular detritus,
which, had they existed, could hardly have escaped M. Gaupry’s notice. I infer
from these facts that the submergence of this island was comparatively slight, and
resulted only in a small settlement from the superincumbent turbid waters of the
Loess-like deposit which covers much of the lower grounds, where it attains in places
a thickness apparently of about 20 feet.

Northern Syria.—Near Lattakia, on the coast opposite Cyprus, Dr. Post* discovered
at a height of 150 to 250 feet above the sea-level, a bed of marine shells, supposed to
be a Raised Beach ; but in the absence of a list of the shells, its exact age cannot be
settled. It may correspond with the Pliocene beds of Cyprus.

Palestine.—Amongst the incidental geological notices of Canon TristRaAmt are
some bearing upon the question before us. In passing over the promontory south of
Beyrout, he found a mass of bone breccia with fragments of “ flint chips” in crevices
