154 DR. A. D. IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS.

1897 Porter published an admirable and fully illustrated account of the intestinal
Protozoa of L, flavipes, confirming and extending the observations of Lemy. He
states that he was unable to find any trace of an oral aperture in Trichonympha, and
believes that solid food particles become enclosed by folds of the body, and entangled
in the cilia, and thereby become gradually engulfed within the cytoplasm of the
organism. He further adds that he never found any food particles in the anterior
nucleus-containing portion of the body. Gregarines he found to be very common,
and also Pyrsonympha vertens Leidy, which appears to be always attached to the
walls of its host's intestineâ€”an important fact overlooked by Lerpy.

In 1904 Mlle. Foa (1904, p. 618) published some observations on the process of
division in Trichonymphu agilis, and she also studied, in conjunction with Grasst
(Grasst and Foa, 1904, p. 241), the same process in Jania annectens. In the
following year this authoress (Foa, 1905, p. 542) described two genera of Flagellate
parasites, Calonympha and Devescovina, each with a single species, from unnamed
Chilian Termites. A few years later, Hartmann (1910, p. 349) published a
detailed study of Trichonympha hertwigi, sp. nov., from a Brazilian Termite,

describing young forms, males and females, and methods of gamete formation. In
the same year Dopett (1910, p. 65) described the first intestinal Protozoa from
Asiatic Termitidee. His material was obtained from the workers of Calotermes
