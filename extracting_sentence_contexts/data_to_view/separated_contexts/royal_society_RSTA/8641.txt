The sequence of logarithms of intensity is found to be, to base 10,

1°17, 1:68, 1°69, b64,. 88> Beso aneacs

and these also, especially when the dark space is included, do not fit well into an
interpolation formula of the above type. It is probable that any law, in order to be
valid over this wide region, must be somewhat cumbrous. The dark space must, in
fact, be left out of consideration in obtaining such a formula, and an example of a
three-constant one is

log, l= a + ba + ca*, a = 1°452, b = 0°235, ce = 0°0575,

which gives the second, third, fourth, and sixth numbers accurately and 1°47 for the
fifth, whose actual value was found to be 1°38. The formula is not very good, but
sufficient for our purpose, and the calculated maximum is at the point

x = b/2c = 2°05 mm. INTENSITY RELATIONS IN THE SPECTRUM OF HELIUM. 157

Other formule of interpolation which have been used, though not described in this
communication, give 2°0 mm. as the position of maximum emission of the Diffuse series
of Helium in these experiments.
