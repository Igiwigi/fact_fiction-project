As the history length increases the overall PE also increases, with all nodes acquiring positive
values of PE for large k. For all k, the control kernel nodes have the highest PE, with the exception
of the start node SK (which only receives external input). When the dynamics of the cell-cycle
network is initiated, knowledge about future states can only be stored in the spatial dimension
so PE < 0 for all nodes. The transition to temporal storage first occurs for the four control kernel
nodes, which for k= 4 have PE > 0, while others nodes have negative PE (self-loops nodes) or
PE close to 0. All nodes make the transition to PE > 0 at history length k =5. This suggests that
the informational architecture of the cell cycle is space (processing) dominated in its early evolution
and later transitions to being time (storage) dominated with a characteristic time scale.

(b) Inter-level architecture

We pointed out in ยง3 the fact that the local-level informational architecture picks out a clear
difference between biological and random networks, whereas the global measures do not. We
conjecture that this is because in biological systems important information flows occur between
levels, ie. from local to global and vice versa, rather than being solely characteristic of local or
