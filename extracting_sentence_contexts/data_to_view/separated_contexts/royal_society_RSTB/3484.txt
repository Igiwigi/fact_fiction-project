insist that the facts of Monotreme development not only permit, but must be held
to demand, an analysis of the knot-streak complex into distinct morphological
elements.

(e) The “ Archenteric” Nature of the “ Head-Process.,”

A further corollary of the conclusions arrived at in this paper is that the time-
honoured term “ head-process” ought to be discarded as an inappropriate designation
for the anterior prolongation of the archenteron (ef. also Husrecur (’02, p. 28,
footnote) ). As originally employed by v. K6xirKER, the term “ head-process of
the primitive streak” implied a view of its nature and origin which is inconsistent
with the facts of Monotreme development.
