fronts, and these definitions would in fact exclude most LBVs from the class. In particular, the
important conjecture that S Dor variations are caused by optically thick winds at constant Lgoi
may be wrong, and steady super-Eddington winds may not be the correct or dominant driving
mechanism in many giant LBV eruptions (see review by Smith [1]).

Studies with quantitative spectroscopy [15-18] have disproven the conjecture that S Doradus
brightening events are caused by developing pseudo-photospheres in optically thick winds, as
suggested initially by Davidson [11] and reviewed by HD94 [7]. The mass-loss rates of S Dor
maxima are not high enough to make such large pseudo-photospheres, and so they are more
ikely to be caused by envelope inflation or pulsation [19,20]. This inflation may arise due to the
subsurface Fe opacity peak. Moreover, bolometric luminosities during S Doradus eruptions are
not really constant [17], probably because energy from the radiation field is put into work that
must be done to inflate the envelope. Similarly, the idea that giant-eruption maxima are caused
