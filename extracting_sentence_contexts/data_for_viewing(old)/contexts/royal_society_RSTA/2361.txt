dissociative recombination, triatomic during the previous (2012) Royal Society Discussion
hydrogen, isotopologues Meeting, Chemistry, astronomy and physics of Hy (see

[1]), was considered satisfactory. Taking into account the
controversial history of Hj, described in considerable
detail in [1-5], this was significant progress. Maybe the
Mats Larsson most conspicuous sign of this progress is the fact that

new ion storage ring results have been reported, and the

rings where studies of H} were most actively pursued,

CRYRING in Stockholm and TSR in Heidelberg, have

been decommissioned or transferred to other duties. It

was consensus among practitioners of the magnetic ion

storage rings that the technology had reached its ultimate
