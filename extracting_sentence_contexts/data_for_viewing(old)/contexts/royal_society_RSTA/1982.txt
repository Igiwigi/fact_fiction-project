can be blamed for inflaming it. Galle in his letter to Le Verrier announcing the discovery suggested
the new planet be called Janus, being so far out of the Solar System. Le Verrier rejected it by
saying that this would imply the planet was the last in the system, and wrote that the Bureau des
Longitudes had chosen the name Neptune (although this seems to actually be his own invention).
This exchange between Galle and Le Verrier was circulated in the newspapers and in Britain it
was transmitted by The Athenaeum on 10 October 1846. In spite of that Challis wrote in his article of
17 October: ‘The part taken by Mr. Adams in the theoretical search after this planet will, perhaps,
be considered to justify the suggesting of a name. With his consent, I mention Oceanus as one
which may possibly receive the votes of astronomers’ [45, p 1069].

The national part of the scandal was all about ‘depriving this country and his own University
of the merit of the first announcement’ [2, p xxvii]. The British public and scientific establishment
was shocked by the fact that Adams’ prediction was about nine months before Le Verrier’s and
that nothing was published about it. The blame was put at Challis and Airy for not giving ‘the
young and retired man the kind of help or advice that he should have received’ [2, p xxvi]. Writing
a few years after Airy’s death, Glaisher explicitly puts the blame on the Astronomer Royal for
not making sure that Adams’ work was published. Such opinions remained well over hundred
years in the literature about the discovery of Neptune (e.g. [15,16]), but recent studies are more
sympathetic to Airy (e.g. [18,55]) and Challis [12].

Was Adams an inexperienced youth who had a ‘difficulty, which all young writers feel more
or less, in putting into shape and order what he has done’ [56, p xxx]? Or did Adams act ‘like a
bashful boy rather than like a man who had made a great discovery’ [57, p xxvi]? This remains
