When the temperature of active volant insects is to be
taken, it is preferable to inclose them singly in a small phial, introducing them with
the forceps as before, and being particularly careful not to touch the phial with the
fingers. The degree of activity or quiescence of the insect must always be parti-
cularly noticed, and also the number of inspirations. By attending to these facts we
acquire a knowledge of the amount of respiration compared with the quantity of
heat evolved, as indicated by the thermometer. The temperature of the insect taken
on the exterior of the body is always a little lower than that of the interior ; but the
difference is not s0 great as might at first be imagined, s0 that I have generally pre-
ferred taking the exterior temperature, because the observations are then less com-
plicated by unnatural causes. The interior temperature is seldom if ever more than
a degree and a half, or at most two degrees above the exterior, and often not even
half a degree, when the insect is in a state of perfect rest.
