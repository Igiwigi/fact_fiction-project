STRUTT ON THE THEORY OF RESONANCE. When, however, the separate passages are sufficiently far apart, the constant & for the
system, considered as a single communication between the interior of the resonator and
the external air, is the simple swm of the values belonging to them when taken sepa-
rately, which would not otherwise be the case. This is a point to which we shall return
later, but in the mean time, by addition of equations (7), we find

&,+&,+E(6,+6)(X,+X4)=0,

If there be any number of necks for which the values of & are C,, C,, C4, -+ ++, and no
two of which are near enough to interfere, the same method is applicable, and gives

n=2z\/2utgt =, TITS (4)

when there are two similar necks &,=c,, and

n=v/2 x <3 y

The note is accordingly higher than if there were only one neck in the ratio of 4/2: 1,
a fact observed by SoNDHAUSS and proved theoretically by HeamonTz for the case of
openings which are mere holes in the sides of the reseryoir.

Doudle Resonance. Suppose that there are two reseryoirs, S, S', com- Fig. 1.
municating with each other and with the external
air by narrow passages or necks. If we were t

consider SS! as a single reseryoir and to apply equa- x Nl Xe
tion (9), we should be led to an erroneous result ;

for the reasoning on which (9) is founded proceeds on the assumption that, within the
reservoir, the inertia of the air may be left out of account, whereas it is evident that the
vis via of the motion through the connecting passage may be as great as through the
two others.
