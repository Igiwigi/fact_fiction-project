Experiments were next made to investigate the way in which the current varied
with the potential when the wire A,B, was charged positively. It was found that
the current E.M.F. curves were markedly
different from those previously obtained with
carbon and platinum, The current was small
at first and increased much more rapidly with
the voltage than if the two were proportional. In fact, the general shape of the current E.M.F.
curves was much like that of the curves for
current and temperature obtained with carbon
and platinum. There was no indication of
saturation at any potential. These differences are to be attributed to the
difference in the experimental conditions and
especially in the shape of the electrodes.
