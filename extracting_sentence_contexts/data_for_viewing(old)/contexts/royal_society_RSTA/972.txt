solving numerically equation (2.4). Fixed parameters are « = 6 =D=1and y =0 or 0:5 (indicated in the figure). The
straight lines are the small-z approximations given by equation (2.5). The dots denote results obtained by numerical simulation
of the equations using an Euler forward difference scheme, with as initial condition a step function. (Online version in colour.)

The above equation has been solved numerically. The minimal speed cm =cm(t) is shown in
figure 2 for two different values of y together with their local approximation

cm =2—(y +2)t + O(t?) (t > 0). (2.5)


The expression (2.5) clearly illustrates the fact that the minimal speed is decreasing with the ls |
delay. Equation (2.4) is obtained as follows: first, we switch to travelling wave coordinates by

substituting z = x + ct in equation (2.3), then we linearize the resulting equation around u = 0 and 3
examine the decay to zero of u(z) as z—> —oo. A front that decays to zero in an oscillatory fashion 1S

is of no interest since u is a population and thus needs to remain positive. The interesting result [8

from an ecological point of view is that the minimum speed decreases compared to equation (2.2)
as the delay increases.
