TI have seen these motions of the altered blood-corpuscles, in fluid collected on
the fimbriated portion of the Fallopian tube, in a Rabbit which had not had connexion
with the male, but was killed during the rut.

18. They seem to be attended in some instances with a considerable increase in
the size of the corpuscle (fig. 3. y.)}.

19. Should these facts be thought to confirm the opinion of Hue, that the
Blood © has life within itself,” or © acquires it in the act of forming organic bodies,”
because its corpuscles in certain altered states exhibit © vital action,” still his assertion
that © the red globules” are the least important part of the blood, will appear to have
no just foundation.

+ The examinations were usually commenced a few minutes after the animal had been killed.

{ Reference is made by R. Wacxzr to a statement of Czermac with which I am unacquainted. * Vital
motions,” 8xys Wacxxs, ** such as those which CzerMac maintains that he has observed (for instance in Blood
from the gills of the Proteus), I have never seen ; and this assertion certainly rests on an illusion occasioned
by the phenomenon which is produced by ciliary motion,” Wacns supposes the motions seen by CzErRMAc
to have been caused by portions of the gills, the cilia of which set the escaped corpuscles of the Blood in
motion (Beitriige zur vergl. Phys, Heft Il. pp. 17, 18.).

$ As stated in the London and Edinburgh Philoszophical Magazine for August, 1840, p. 157, my later obser-
vations induce me to believe that the rapid and incessant changes in form of altered blood-corpuscles, described
in pars 12 to 18, of this memoir, are caused by contiguous cilia; though I have not yet succeeded in de-

monstrating the latter, It is certainly a remarkable state of the blood-disc, however, which admits of such
changes in its form, —November 1840,
