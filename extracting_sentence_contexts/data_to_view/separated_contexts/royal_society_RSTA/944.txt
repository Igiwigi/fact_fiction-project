(e) The distance between the electrodes, particularly in relation to the size of the
dark space. If the film was placed too close, say within a millimetre or two of
the edge of the dark space, the colour and thickness were not uniform. The edges, for
instance, were thicker, no doubt owing to space variations of the electric field,
consequent on the fact that the limit of the dark space was not plane. (f) The residual gases. Hydrocarbons have a pernicious effect.
