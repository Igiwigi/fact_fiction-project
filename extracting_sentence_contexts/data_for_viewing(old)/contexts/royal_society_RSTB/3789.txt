prophase it is most difficult to find chromosomes the width measurements of which
can beâ€™ taken as a true index of the typical width of a univalent chromosome.
A. further complication may arise, as in Crepis virens, where not only is there an
early fission, but the chromosomes become flattened, prior to the separation of their
daughter halves.

But as the matter is one of considerable moment, we have re-investigated a

large amount of material derived from animals and plants in order to ascertain
whether, in fact, there is any justification for the assertion that the chromosomes of
the higher animals, and incidentally of plants also, do exhibit that degree of constancy
in the. width of their chromosomes which has been claimed for them.

We may say at once that we do not find the chromosomes of members of a given
phylum to possess identical widths as stated by Mrrx. It is quite clear, on the
other hand, that chromosomes of closely related animals (see the instance of the
Prawn and the Lobster, described below) may differ very widely in this respect.
As we cannot, therefore, admit the validity of the primary evidence urged in support
of his theory of chroniosomal evolution, it is not necessary to enter into the theory
itself, What we propose to do here is to give an account of our own observations
on the dimensions of the chromosomes, first discussing briefly the limits within
which the observations themselves can be regarded as being substantially accurate.
