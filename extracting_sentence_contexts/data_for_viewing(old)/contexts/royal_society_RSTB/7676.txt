ground on 13 June 1943. During 30 min. about five hundred locusts crossed each cloth
within about 3 m. above it, and many more at greater heights. This time there was a certain
amount of spontaneous settling, for nineteen low-fliers came down and settled elsewhere in
the vicinity nowhere near a cloth. But no sudden changes of direction occurred elsewhere
in the vicinity, whereas many fliers hesitated on passing over the cloth, veered away,
resumed their original course and flew on. Perhaps fewer locusts were caused actually to
settle by the cloth on these second and third occasions because the locusts had been flying
already over a variety of backgrounds. In the first exposure of the cloth the locusts had had
no such distraction for perhaps hours en route, and the black patch must have been a very
novel feature in the landscape for them.

The results of these trials showed that migrants could not be caused to settle in appreciable
numbers by a black conspicuous object. More interesting, however, was the fact that many
did react to it as they passed over by hesitation and change of direction, soon corrected.
Settling appeared to be merely an extreme form of the reaction to the same kind of stimulus.

The question naturally arises as to whether such effects occur also on a much larger scale
when their importance would be correspondingly greater. Unfortunately, it is impossible
to distinguish the visual effects of large-scale physical features from the other effects of such
features, such as changes in wind, temperature, etc., but one or two field observations may
be mentioned here. t

Near Bandar Abbas, Iran, on 27 April 1943, a large, loose, pink swarm extending from
the ground up to about 50 m. was ‘rolling’ in little wind across the level floor of a wide
valley. In front of it was a steep-sided ridge 150 m. high. On coming up against this wall
