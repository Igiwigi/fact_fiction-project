Provinces ; Whites.â€”The usual increased proportion of F. produced by illegitimate
unions is evident in each province except Matanzas and Pinar del Rio, in both of
which the excess of M. among illegitimate births is chiefly due to the results of
1905, which, as I have before remarked, was a_ specially prolific year. But
according to Table XIV whites produced fewer M. that year than usual, and I have
already shown that as a rule increased fertility is associated with an increased
F. output for whites (Table VII).

This variation of the rule in Matanzas and Pinar is therefore of interest, and it will
be seen that the returns for these provinces do show peculiarities which indicate the
exercise of local influences on the proportion of the sexes produced.

The fact that the figures for illegitimate births are more irregular than are those
for legitimate births is no doubt due to the much smaller number of the former in the
case of whites.

The records for still-births call for no remarks.

The total production column is remarkable only for the high excess of M. in Pinar,
the small excess in Oriente, and the uniform results for every other province, the
death column for the low proportion of M. deaths in Pinar, and the high proportion
for Oriente. The former appears to be markedly favourable, the latter as markedly
inimical, to white M., and it will be observed that these pronounced differences occur
at opposite ends of the Island, at the extreme west and extreme east, where very
different climatic conditions prevail.
