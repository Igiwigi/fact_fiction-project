twisting round the centre or any other irregularity, throughout the whole of the
interval of time. Frequently slight cracking of the crystal is accompanied by
widening or narrowing of the bands during one part of the observation and movement
in the inverse direction during the other, or possibly by twisting for a whole revo-
lution, and very frequently by merely jumping several bands, the appearance at the
end being much the same as at the beginning. Such an observation is, of course,
valueless, but the Abbe method would not detect this fact. Undoubtedly, the
authorâ€™s method, although very fatiguing, is the only one which is trustworthy
when fragile substances are under investigation.

The counting of the bands was achieved precisely as described in the dilatometer
memoir (p. 348) with the aid of the tape-puncturing recorder, the induction coil
which illuminated the hydrogen Geissler tube being actuated at sufficiently rapidly
succeeding intervals to enable the author to observe the passage of at least every
quarter of a band. Timing the transit with the watch is an excellent aid, as, if the
observation is trustworthy, there should be no sudden changes of rapidity in the move-
ment of the bands. When the Fletcher ring-gas-burner below the double air-bath is
first ignited, the bands move very slowly, the rapidity then growing with a regular
increment until it reaches, in the case of large expansions where at least forty bands
