passing through the cortical layer, two crescentic secondary bundles, each of which
have been exactly like that of fig. 39; on the concave side of the perfect crescentic
bundle (aa), on the right of the figure, we have a yet s8maller one (@), which has
evidently been detached from that with which it is 80 closely associated. In fig. 35B,
which represents a second section of the same petiole, taken a little higher up, we
obtain a clue to the relations of these several parts. At « we have the hour-glass
bundle accidentally ruptured across its central portion ; at @ we find the large primary
crescentic bundle in its normal position as a single unbroken band. Longitudinal
sections in my cabinet clearly demonstrate that the vessels of this primary crescentic
bundle leave those of the hour-glass one very gradually, since the two sets run for
considerable distances in perfect parallelixm with each other. At aa, ac we find the
two secondary crescentic bundles going off to some secondary lateral appendages, clearly
demonstrating the fact that those appendages, whatever they have been, were alternately
given off from the opposite convexities of the hour-glass bundle. The groove at a" is
nearly obliterated, in consequence of the recent detachment of the primary crescentic
bundle &'; but the opposite side has 80 far recovered from the effects of the detachment”
of the secondary bundles aa, aa, that, instead of being truncated, it has regained its |

convex form, and its canal (@”) has, in like manner, ceased to be a mere superficial
groove. But we further obserye that the small bundle (2) also seen in fig. 35 A has
now moved away from the larger secondary bundle (aa) with which it was s0 closely
as80ciated in the last figure. I think I discover a similar bundle at ' in corresponding
