140 D. M. 8S. WATSON ON THE ACANTHODIAN FISHES

Brottt has shown that the large admedian part of the hyoid is closely attached to the
lower jaw, that its lateral extremity is extended into a slender backwardly and out-
wardly directed process, and that a series of two or three other slender rods are
attached to the hyoid and pass back roughly parallel to this process. As Broti1 has stated
these can only be the anterior ends of branchial arches. It is possible that the whole
unusual arrangement is associated with the protrusible mouth and represents a device
for driving the jaw forward.

One very interesting feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of the
large pectoral fin is supported by ossified radials, a condition comparable with that
of Cladoselache and in sharp contrast to that of the Acanthodians. It is probable that
the condition in Gemiindina represents a secondary lengthening of the radials from a
stage in which they were short and restricted to the base of the fin.

Professor Brorui’s admirable ‘restored figure (19304, fig. 8) represents the animal
swimming by causing a series of waves to pass from the anterior to the posterior ends
of the pectoral fin. That this conception is correct seems to me altogether probable.
But such movements can only be carried out with the necessary power if the intrinsic
fin muscles, and the radials to which they are attached, be long. The exactly similar
conditions in skates were clearly introduced to subserve the same end. Gemiindina is
also interesting because its single dorsal fin has an anterior spine as in Pterichthys or an
