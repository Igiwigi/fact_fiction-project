and V. of Plate XI. represent the results of those Tables. From these figures, or from the Tables which they represent, it is evident that the
difference in the time of yanishing of the Diurnal Tide at the times of High and Low
Water is not altogether due to the Solar 'Tide; for at the Equinox, when the Solar 'Tide
has disappeared, the Age of the Tunar Dinrnal Tide at High Water is 1* 21", while the
Age of the same Tide at Low Water is only 04 21Ãž; showing a permanent difference of
one whole day in the times of disappearance of the Tide at High and Low Water quite
independent of the Solar 'Tide, which, as I have already shown, tends to increase this
difference as we approach the Solstices. 'The Means of the Ages of the Diurnal Tide, taken from the Tides of the 13th and 25th
of March and the 6th of April, 1849, at High Water, and from the Tides of the 11th
and 24th of March and the 5th of April, 1849, at Low Water, are 1* 21" and 002] *,

I am unable to explain why the Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide at High Water should
be greater than its Age at Low Water; but there is good reason to believe that it is an
established fact, as I found the same kind of difference of Age in the Tidal Observa-
tions made in 1850-51, on the coasts of Ireland, by the Royal Irish Academy. The
following Table shows the difference in the Irish stations. Age of Lunar Diurnal Tide, deduced from Observations at High and Low Water, on
