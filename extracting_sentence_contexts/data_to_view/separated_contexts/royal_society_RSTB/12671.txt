The evidence presented here
is consistent with the specialization hypothesis showing
that at a young age, children are particularly adept,
when compared with orangutans, at faithfully imitating
arbitrary sequences. Orangutansâ€™ comparatively poor per-
formance on the same tasks and conditions cannot be
explained by some general representational deficit or a lack
of interest (or motivation), as they showed significant
learning in individual conditions and even some vicarious
conditions. However, differences may be explained by the
fact that vicarious sequence learning underlies many
uniquely human behaviours that range from complex tool
use to language and ritual. These results raise the question:
is the relative facility by which humans vicariously learn
novel sequences a cause of the emergence of ritual and
language or, as Heyes [26] has suggested, is the specialization
a product of these cultural activities? We may never know
for sure.
