The measure of the correlation is, therefore, in just the same way 439— 439°
0743.

In this case, therefore, the correlation appears to be very low, but possibly the
cause of this is that where the a.b.s. on one side was “large” and on the other
“very small,” the larva was recorded as asymmetrical, though the feature was
present on both sides, but very differently developed. Had the larvae been recorded
in greater detail for this purpose, the correlation would doubtless have appeared
greater.

It appears, therefore, from these observations that there is comparatively little
correlation between the two sides of the body in respect of the three characters
which have been chiefly studied in this work. This fact has been noticed before,
especially by SreryBrick, who says that in the larvee which he examined a large
proportion were differently developed on the two sides, but he gives no statistics
from which the actual frequency of such asymmetry can be found. It is of consider-
able interest to discover that in these hybrid larvae such a very large proportion
should develop, and therefore presumably inherit the maternal features differently
in the two halves of the body, for these differences can hardly be the result of
differences of conditions affecting the two sides of the larvee. It can only be supposed,
therefore, that the halves of the skeleton are largely independent, and may differ

in the way in which their characters are inherited from the parents.
