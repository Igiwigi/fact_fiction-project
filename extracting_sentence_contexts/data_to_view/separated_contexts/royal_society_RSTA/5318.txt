A third source of
uncertainty is input uncertainty, discussed in §5. In this model for X there will be components of X(t) that are operationally defined,
corresponding to the quantities that we wish to learn, but there may also be additional
instrumental components whose main purpose is to allow us to express our judgements about
the evolution of the operationally defined components more easily. So, in fact it would be more
accurate to say, in the opening paragraph, that we wish to learn a subset of X(t) for te T. To assist us in learning about X there is a collection of measurements

which has the standard conditional independence properties in which each measurement is
conditionally independent of everything else given the state vector at its measurement time. Figure 1 shows the standard representation of this statistical model in the form of a conditional
independence graph.
