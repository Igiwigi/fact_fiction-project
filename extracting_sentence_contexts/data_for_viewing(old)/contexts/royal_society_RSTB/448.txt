of fibres in the capsules, still less differentiation would be found. This is obviously
shown in Table V., but on inspection, the representation of even flexion of the small
toes is consistently (every group) in front of that of extension. To a minor degree
and with less consistency (4 of 6 groups) the same holds for the hallux,

Relative Amount or Degree of Representation of Extension compared to Flexion.

This subject may not be without interest to those who have, from excitation
experiments, attempted to gauge the relative amount of functional activity in the
cortex.

The facts bearing upon this point obtained from the records of hinge joint move-
ments are so clear and unmistakable that they are of value.

The following are the proportional rates of frequency as observed in the capsule.
