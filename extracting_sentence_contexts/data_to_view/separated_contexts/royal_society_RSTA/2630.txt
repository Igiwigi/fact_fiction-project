There are four very active volcanoes in Italy (Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano and : =
Vesuvius). We plan to use muography to glean further insights into the workings of two of these 2
volcanoes, namely Vesuvius and Stromboli. The former is famous for the destruction of Pompeii [3
and Herculaneum in the eruption in 79 AD and is now in the middle of the sprawling urban : |
development that has characterized the city of Naples in the past 100 years. :8
It is, in fact, impossible to underestimate the disaster potential of this situation. Vesuvius has : S
erupted many times since and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted â€œS

within the last 100 years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world
because of the population of 3000 000 people living nearby (figure 1), making it the most densely
populated volcanic region in the world, and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of
the Plinian type.
