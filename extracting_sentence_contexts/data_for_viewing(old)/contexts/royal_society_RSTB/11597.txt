munication with other individuals and groups in the A social network is the pattern of relations and interactions
organization [16]. This communication is central to how among the individuals in a group. Moreover, the network has
team members seek information, resources and support resources—which are sometimes referred to as social capital—

within the organization [17]. that individuals can access and use [20,21]. Network position


leads to individual differences in social capital. However, the
social network is also a collective intelligence where the group
whole is greater than the sum of individual intelligences [22].
My discussion of spatial and social cognition notwithstanding,
I conceptualize ‘collective intelligence’ in network rather than
in cognitive terms. In fact, I argue that the connectedness and
immersion of humans in social networks means that collective
decisions can be understood even if they are not declared expli-
citly [5]. However, I also acknowledge that physical space plays
a significant role in the creation, maintenance and death of
social ties and networks [23-25]. A key mechanism behind
the influence of space on social networks is the structuring of
face-to-face interpersonal encounters and interactions. Face-
to-face (as opposed to electronically mediated) communication
and encounters rely on the latent potential of physical space to
structure potential encounters, which is contingent on the
co-location of individuals.
