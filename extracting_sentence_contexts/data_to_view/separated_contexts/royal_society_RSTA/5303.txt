Nevertheless, the idea is to put together a set
of comprehensive papers addressing many different contexts where nonlinear
behaviour emerges at very small scales, either setting the features of systems
that are themselves of meso and nano sizes or being the smallest manifestation
of nonlinearities in larger scales. The publication selects problems that are
representative of the fundamental questions raised in the area, as well as of
possible technological applications. In fact, by addressing topics such as:

— decoherence and the environment influence on quantum problems,
— large-molecule dynamics,

— fluid and plasma physics,

— nonlinear wave propagation,

— statistical mechanics and thermodynamics at small scales, and

— response theory,

this thematic issue can already serve as a ‘guide’ pointing to possible new
directions of research, relevant problems that still need deeper analysis, and in
what concrete situations, new methodologies and techniques should be developed
to understand nonlinearity at very small scales. In addition to the interest and relevance of the problems treated in the works
in this special issue—of course, already properly presented and discussed in
each individual paper—we would like to briefly highlight, throughout the brief
comments below, some of their methodological strategies and technical protocols
used to uncover the intricate behaviours observed in nonlinear systems at very
short scales. The idea of open quantum systems, namely those in which a quantum
subsystem of interest interacts with extra (classical or quantum) degrees of
freedom is addressed in the first four papers.
