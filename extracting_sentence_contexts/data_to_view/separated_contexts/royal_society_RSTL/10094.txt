Zine Tod. He also represents this striation in figs. 17, 18, 19, and 28,
Tafel I. ; and again in fig. 23, Tafel IT., he shows that a similar striation may be 8een
in the closing membrane of the pits in the thickened cells of the seed-coat of Viseum. As far as regards Ornithogalum I can fully confirm his results, and the fact of the
existence of a similar structure in Tazodium and Viseum is one of great value. Staining with picric-HorManx's-blue, snbsequent to the action of iodine and
Chlor. Zine Tod., will demonstrate in the case of Ornithogalum that the pit membrane
is distinetly blue, while the rest of the cell-wall is practically colourless, and will also
bring out more clearly the striation of the pit membrane, due to the presence of
threads.
