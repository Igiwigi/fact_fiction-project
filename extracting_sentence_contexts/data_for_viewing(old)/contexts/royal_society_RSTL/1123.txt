mulated strata have in all these similar instances been cut
down vertically by the same agent, and that this agent was
not the sea.

Nor has this powerful agent confined its operations to our
coast, or tothe periphery of our basaltic area ; we-can trace
it over its whole surface.; we find throughout its interior, simi-
lar, though very diminutive abruptions, executed precisely in
the same manner, that is, strata cut across by a long vertical
facade, their planes on the upper side perfectly undisturbed,
while on the lower side all the materials of which that part of
the stratum was. once composed are completely carried off, —
(See 6th fact.)

We are now unavoidably led into a discussion of a question
which has at all times occupied the attention of naturalists.
