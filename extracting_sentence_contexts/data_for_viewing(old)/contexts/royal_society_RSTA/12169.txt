: Electrodynamic effect of motion of a charged Body.

g a 59. When a charged body moves relatively to the surrounding zther, with a
_ velocity small compared with the velocity of electric propagation, it practically
| carries its electric displacement-system (jf, g, /) along with it in an equilibrium
configuration. Thus the displacement at any point fixed in the ether will change,
aud we shall virtually have the field filled with electric currents which are completed
in the lines of motion of the charged elements of the body, so Jong as that motion
continues, On this view, Maxwe t's convection-current is not differentiated from
onduction-current in any manner whatever, if we except the fact that viscous decay
ally accompanies the latter.

A metallically coated glass disc, rotating in its own plane without altering its
osition in space, would on this theory produce no convection-current at all; but if
he coating of the disc is divided into isolated parts by scratches, as in RowLanp and
