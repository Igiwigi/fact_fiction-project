There seems, however,
to be no doubt that the elements in question are really sieve-tubes ; for Mr. J. H.
Fav, who has examined with care their structure and development, confirms the
statements of Dr Bary and Russow. If the central cylinder of Osmunda be regarded
as reduced polystelic with the foliar gaps very much narrowed and the internal
phloem degenerate, it is possible to understand the presence of the peculiar bays ot
phloem between the strands of xylem, A further peculiarity of Osmunda and Todea,
in addition to the one just discussed, is the concentric nature of the foliar strands. There are now recorded a number of striking examples of conservatism in the foliar
strands of vascular plants, and it seems reasonable, especially in view of the facts

described in the foregoing paragraphs, to regard the concentric structure of the leaf-
traces of the Osmundaceve as an ancestral feature which has been lost in the cauline
fibro-vascular system. This view is further supported by the mesarch structure of the
tracheary bundles of the stem.
