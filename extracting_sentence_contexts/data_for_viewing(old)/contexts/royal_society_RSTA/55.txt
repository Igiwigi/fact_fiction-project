— Prescribing point-wise balances of the actions occurring in complex materials in analogy
with the standard instances is a direct jump to the end of the discussion about balance


equations. When we act in this way, beyond the structure of the equations, we presume
the representation of the microstructural contact actions in terms of microstresses and
self-actions, without having proven the analogous of Cauchy’s theorem for the standard
tension. In its original formulation, such a theorem requires the boundedness of the
bulk actions, the knowledge of the integral balance of forces, and the action—reaction
principle. If we choose to act in this way, we have to remind that we are not sure about
the effectiveness of the result: analogy, in fact, is not always a secure path.

The direct assignment of integral balances demands fewer assumptions, in fact, and
allows to try to prove Cauchy-type theorems. However, since we consider M as a
nonlinear manifold, which is the general unifying choice, prescribing an independent
integral balance of micro-actions would be highly questionable formally. We would write,
in fact, integrals involving integrands taking values on the cotangent bundle of M, which
is anonlinear space (unless M coincides with a linear space) and is the target space of the
integrand, so the definition of the integral itself would be questionable. Moreover, if we
consider M to be coincident with a linear space, we can see that such a balance would be
essentially superfluous, as shown in a theorem below.

When we adopt the principle of virtual power (as in [38]), we are directly prescribing
the weak form of the point-wise balance equations, the form used in computational
procedures. The choice implies also the presumption of the expression of the contact
