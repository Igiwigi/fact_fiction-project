ness of pitch one-half, and making furrows in it by means of a hot iron quite down to,
the metallic plate; the furrows were two inches apart, and there were two sets at
right angles to each other, 80 that there were nowhere more than four square inches
of pitchy surface in continuity. The result was, that the defining power of the spe-
culum was immediately much improved. After many trials, however, a far better mode
of effecting the saime object suggested itself. The furrows were with difficulty kept
everywhere open, and where there was a failure in this respect the old evil recurred,
the polisher lost its figure ; moreover, it was not found practicable to reduce the
thickness of pitch to a minimum, which was a great object, and there were other
minor practical inconveniences. These defects were all remedied by dividing the iron
disc itself instead of the pitch ; this could be done to any degree of minuteness re-
quired, and the continuous pitehy surface so reduced that its thickness might be made
a minimum, in fact, not greater than necessary to satisfy the condition of enduring the
small amount of abrasion which takes place during the time required to complete the
polishing. The improvement which immediately followed this simple device was far
greater than could have been anticipated, and the divided three-feet speculum, after
this change, defined better with a power of 1200 than it had done before with a power
of 300. . Several polishers were made on this construction, the arrangement and di-
mensions of the grooves being somewhat different : that last used in polishing the two
three-feet specula I think is the best, and a drawing of it has been annexed, figs. 8 and
9: the circular grooves were turned with a slide rest and are three-eighths of an inch
deep and one quarter wide, leaving bands of continuous surface one quarter of an
inch wide; the grooves at right angles are about one inch and a quarter apart, one
quarter of an inch wide, and half an inch deep ; they were cut with a small circular
8w, under which the polisher was made to traverse on the bed of a large lathe.
