This
is carried out by the brush sete aided by the currents from the inter-limb spaces which
commence in this region. The claw processes of the anterior gnathobases must also assist in pushing forwards
the food mass but I believe that this function diminishes as the food passes forwards. In fact, I do not believe that the main function of the claw process is gnathobasic. If it were so, it is difficult to see why it has lost the claw armature which is so conspicuous
in the hinder limbs, for its terminal claws, in fact, the only claws it retains, progressively
diminish in actual size in the anterior limbs although the gnathobase itself becomes
considerably larger. The function of the claw process is, I believe, to assist in directing forwards the spurts
of water leaving the inter-limb spaces.
