Indeed, it can be written as f(r)g(r)[— cos((k1 + k2)@) + cos((k; — k2)@)]. The
(ky +kz) term is not harmful by the same argument as above, however the (k; — kz) term is
problematic. In fact, it provides a term of order h'/? in the expression for ug; this occurs because
(ky — ko) ~ h7"/2 whereas ky, kz and ky + ky are all of order h~!. Moreover, as w changes with r on
length scale h'/2, so should ug. Thus, one expects 0,Ug ~ 1.
