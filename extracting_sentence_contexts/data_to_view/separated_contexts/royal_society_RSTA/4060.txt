Although the systematic
nature of these organisms that may have formed a cuticle or a similar extracellular covering is
controversial, they may have played an important role in the transition from water to land. One
of these groups is Nematophytes, puzzling organisms with a tubular organization of uncertain
affinities [152-155]. However, recent investigations have led to the hypothesis that at least some fossil remnants
assigned to Nematophytes are in fact Marchantiophyta [153]. This would fit to the results of the
above-mentioned phylogenies, although other groups of organisms should also be considered in
this context. There are no superhydrophobic plant surfaces yet known that do not have an underlying
cuticle, thus the cuticle must have evolved prior to the emergence and radiation of land plants in
the Early Silurian.
