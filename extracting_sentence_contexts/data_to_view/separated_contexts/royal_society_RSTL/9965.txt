Just as in the case of muscle and nerve, the
proof that it is attended by any chemical alteration or by the separation of any
product of disintegration is wanting, 80 ib is here. In the one cage as in the other,
we must regard the electrical change as a visible sign of an unknown molecular
process. That it is not the primary change which occurs in protoplasm when it enters
into the state of excitation we have evidence in two facts, first, that even when the
exciting agent is an induction current which passes through one of the opposite
surfaces by which the leaf is led off to the galvanometer, so that no time whatever is
lost in transmission, there is still an interval between excitation and response of about
0:03”, during which interval molecular changes are obviously in progress ; and,
secondly, that excitation just insufficient to evoke a response gives effect to a second
which follows it, provided that the interval between the firs} and the second does not
exceed one-third of a second—a result which can only be explained on the supposi-
tion that the first excitation actually effectuates a molecular change, notwithstanding
that the visible sign is wanting. The direction of the excitatory effect in the fundamental experiment is such as to
indicate that in excitation, excited cells become positive to unexcited, whereas in
animal tissues excited parts always become negative to unexcited. The apparent
discrepancy will probably find its explanation in the difference of the structural
relations of the electromotive surfaces.
