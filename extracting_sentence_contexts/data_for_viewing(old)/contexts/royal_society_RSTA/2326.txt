This means that a possibilistic empirical model corresponds to a_locally-agreeing
knowledgebase of the algebra or relational databases. We now have all the elements to establish
the connection between global disagreement and logical forms of contextuality.

Proposition 6.2 (see appendix A for the proof). The knowledgebase K disagrees globally if and only
if S is logically contextual. It disagrees completely if and only if S is strongly contextual.

Note that the first part of the proposition reiterates the idea, expressed in §4c, that contextuality
in an empirical model corresponds to an instance local agreement versus global disagreement.®
The statement connecting strong contextuality with complete disagreement, on the other hand, is
a new addition to the theory.

5In fact, the two results coincide, as one can show that the algebra of relational databases is equivalent to the one of Boolean
potentials via the isomorphism P(X) = 2*.


(a) Detecting logical and strong contextuality is an inference problem

Thanks to proposition 6.2 and the results of the previous sections, we can easily translate the
problem of detecting logical and strong contextuality into inference problems. This aspect is
particularly important since it allows to apply the numerous efficient algorithms developed by
the long-established theory of generic inference. The following proposition follows immediately
from proposition 6.2 and the results of §5b(i),c.

Proposition 6.3. Let S : P(X) — Set be an empirical model over a scenario (X, M,(Om)) . Then
