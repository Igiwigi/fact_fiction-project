On the other hand, if atmospheric CO2 was assumed to be limited to below 600
ppm or a carbon tax of $30 per tonne or more was assumed, fusion was found
to play an important role. Fission will also play a major role while the price of
uranium remains reasonable and in the longer term fast breeder reactors become
accepted. The fact is that it is incredibly hard to meet expected energy demand
with constraints on carbon (either introduced by society, or due to the increasing
scarcity of fossil fuels). Success in developing fusion as an effective large-scale source of power on earth
is not guaranteed. However, given the magnitude of the energy challenge, and the
relatively small investment that is needed on the (approx. $5 trillion per annum)
scale of the energy market, accelerated/fast track development of fusion is fully
justified in view of its enormous potential.
