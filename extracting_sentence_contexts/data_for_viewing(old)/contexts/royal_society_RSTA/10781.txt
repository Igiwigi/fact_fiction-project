Seat of the Back E.M.F, Search Carbons in the Are.

The fact that the are has a back E.M.F. which appears to increase with the amount
of foreign substances present in the vapour column, at once leads to the question
whether this E.M.F. is located at one or the other of the electrodes, or distributed
along the vapour column. In order to obtain an answer to this question, some
experiments were made on a 6-millim. 9°91 ampére solid are by introducing a search
carbon, 2 millims. diameter, into the are, and measuring not only the direct P.D.
between the search carbon and each of the main carbons, but also the impedance to
the high-frequency testing current of that part of the are between it and each ot
the main carbons.

In the experiments, three different positions of the search carbon were employed,
(1) with its centre 1 millim. from the positive electrode, (2) central in the are, (3) with
its centre 1 millim. from the negative electrode. The fine point to which the search
