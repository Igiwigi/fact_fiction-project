state for the NS organization is most probably that of a diffuse
nerve net (though with extensive internal structure; see, for
instance, [86]). This arrangement would also be shared with
the echinoderms. All in all, regardless of whether pterobranchs
or enteropneusts are more similar to ancestral hemichordates,
the common ancestor of Ambulacraria is expected to have a dif-
fuse nerve net [100]. In this new context, a nerve net as seen in
Xenoturbella (and in the acoels and nemertodermatids) would
be again consistent with the placement of Xenacoelomorpha
as a sister group of the Ambulacraria.

Taking into consideration both possible phylogenetic pos-
itions of Xenacoelomorpha and the fact, also stated above, that
Xenoturbella has the shortest branch in all molecular phylogenies
obtained for this clade, it seems reasonable to assume that the
nerve net-like organization present in Xenoturbella most prob-
ably represents the basal condition for Xenacoelomorpha. This
has a profound implication for the evolution of NSs within the
clade, and the observed changes of NS organization within it,
with more compact brains developing in more derived acoel
lineages (probably the result of specific adaptive changes
happening over time).

We are fully aware that even if these evolutionary scenarios
seem feasible, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Xeno-
