In using the frog thus prepared, I have experimented upon the induced contrac-
tions, by causing the nerve that is in contact with the muscle in contraction to be
already in some manner excited by a current or some stimulas. For this purpose T
have comprehended the galvanoscopic frog in the circuit of a voltaic circle, or have
applied upon the nerve a drop of an alkaline solution. Every time that the inducing
muscles are contracted, there is always induced contraction, whether the nerve
through which this current is transmitted be already excited or not, and consequently,
even when the muscles in which the induced contractions are generated, are already
in contraction ; and, in fact, in spite of the contraction already present there is no
difficulty in perceiving the induced contraction that follows. Many easy experiments may be made to prove that in whatever way the nerve of
the inducing muscle be excited, if its contraction fail, the induced contraction is also
wanting. I shall limit myself to reporting some of the principal ones.
