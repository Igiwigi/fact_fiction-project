+ These remarks do not, of course, apply to fire from aircraft. OF THE MOTION OF ROTATED AND UNROTATED ROCKETS 553

The type of instability mentioned in (c) above has been observed with certain experi-
mental rockets (fast spinning projectiles with straight fins and large length-diameter ratio),
and, in fact, the inequalities of Case A (iii) have been used in order to obtain rough informa-
tion on the magnitude of the Magnus moment. Instability of type B. This type of instability, which may be called non-precessional erates.
is unlikely to appear during the burning period of a rocket since it builds up very slowly over
long distances.
