It is easy to see that the foregoing envelope
may be geometrically constructed as follows: viz. if
from the point Q (coordinates cos, s8in6) on the
reflecting circle we draw QM perpendicular to the
line z—m=0, and then from the point M draw MN
perpendicular to QT, the tangent at T, and produce
MN to a point P such that PN=NM, then P is a A.
point of the envelope; and we thence obtain for the »
coordinates (z, y) of a point P of the envelope the
values

Y

= m—2(m— cos 9) cos? 0,
y=s8in {—2(m— cos) cos 0 8in 6,
or, what is the same thing,
x=2 cos 6—m(2 cos? 9—1),
y= in 6(2 cos? +1)—2m sin 6 cos 9,
or, as these equations may also be written,
x=23 cos j—m cos 29+F4 cos 39,
y4=3 8mm 6—msin 26+4 sin 36.
6. This result may be verified by showing that these values satisfy the equation
cos 26+4(x—m) cos 9+ 4y 8in 9+21*—1—2(a*+z*)=0,
and also the derived equation

8n 25+2(z—m) 8in {—2y cos 9=0. We in fact have
x8nd—ycos/= min 6—4 sin 25,
a cos {+y 8in 9=Z—m cos 9+ cos 29,
and thence
(z—m) 8in 8—y cos = —+ in 26,
which is one of the equations to be verified; and also
(x—m) cos 8 +y 8in #=$—2m cos 6+4 cos 28. We have moreover
2+ = + +m*—4m cos9+$ cos 26;

and, by means of these last equations, the other equation
cos 26+4(x—m) cos 6+4y 8in v+20—1 —2(a*+4)=0,

is also verified.

7. The foregoing values of (a, y) give

dx=(—$ 8in 9+ 2m sin 26—23 8in 39)49=—sin 26(3 cos 9—2m)ds,
dy=( $cos9—2m cos 29+3 cos 39)d9= cos 29(3 cos 6—2m1)db,
or, what is the same thing,
du: dy=—sin 29 : cos 26,

Hence taking for a moment (X, Y) as the current coordinates of a point in the tangent

of the envelope, the equation of the tangent of the envelope is
Xdy—Ydr=uady—ydpr,
or, substituting for a, y, dz, dy their values, this equation takes the very simple form
X cos 29—Y sin 29—2 cos9+m=0,
or writing (x, y) in place of (X, Y), that is taking now (, y) as the current coordinates
of a point in the tangent, the equation of the tangent is
# cos 259—y 8in 29—2 cos 6+m=0;

whence observing that this equation may be expressed as a rational equation of the
fourth order in terms of the parameter tan 46 (or cos 9+x/ —1 sin 9), it appears that
the class of the secondary caustic is=4.
