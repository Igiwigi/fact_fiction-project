N. STORY-MASKELYNE ON THE

reflecting plane 110 on the crystal C. In fact the faces of the form (110), though
parallel to what appears to be a somewhat difficult cleavage, neyer present a good even
reflecting surface, being generally more or less conchoidal when cleavage-surfaces, and
dull when natural faces.

'The cleavage-plane 0 01 has a vitreous lustre; the lustre on the planes of the forms
100 and 101, as also of the rounded surface in the zone with them, is usually of a
resinous character, strongly recalling that of opal. It has already been observed that the faces of the octaid forms are almost invariably
rounded. Fair approximate measurements, however, of three of the faces in the zone
[001,110] on the erystal C were obtained ; and one octaid plane on that crystal,
repeated in two octants, gave measurements that accord fairly with the somewhat
complex symbol 54 8.
