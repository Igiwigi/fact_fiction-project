accounted for by slight difference in the steadiness of the temperature. Two nickel
wires, whose diameters were also nearly in the same ratio, namely 2: 1, gave values
for the logarithmic deerements due to internal friction which agreed with each othi
within the errors of observation.

Experiment XXIT.

Two pieces of the same gpecimen of annealed zinc wire, one 602 centims. in length
and the other only 97 centirs. in length, were both tried under nearly the same con-
ditions as regards preliminary treatment and time of vibration, &e. The logarithmic
decrement due to internal friction was, in the case of the longer wire, 003207, and,
in the case of the shorter one, '003327, The difference between these two numbers
can quite be accounted for by the fact that the temperature of the shorter wire was
about 3* C. higher than that of the longer.t

Two pieces of iron wire, cub from the same hank, but one having a length of
96 centims. and the other of 602 centims., gave, when treated in a similar manner,
exactly the same logarithmic decrements.

We may, therefore, regard the logarithmic decrement as independent both of 'the
length and of the diameter of the wire, provided care be taken that the two pieces
of different lengths which are compared shall have suffered the same preliminary
treatment,
