2s) +4() —(&") —(Þ)=0. In a paper in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, vol. vi., this theo-
rem was alleged of all Homogeneous solids, it having been, in fact, tacitly taken for
granted, that Homogeneity involves Metatatic Isotropy, as above defined.

10. Of Orthotatic Symmetry. If it be taken for granted that symmetrical action with respect to a certain set of
axes, between the parts of a body under one kind of strain, involves s8ymmetrical
action with respect to the same axes under all kinds of strains, then one and the
same set of orthogonal axes will be at once Orthotatic, Heterotatic, Metatatic, and
Euthytatic, and for them the whole twelve plagiotatic coefficients will yanish at once,
and the independent tasinomic coefficients be reduced to the nine Orthotatic Coeffi-
cients enumerated in Article 2, As long as the rigidity of solid bodies was ascribed
wholly to mutual attractions and repulsions between centres of force, it is difficult to
see how, with respect to homogeneous substances, the above assumption could be
avoided.
