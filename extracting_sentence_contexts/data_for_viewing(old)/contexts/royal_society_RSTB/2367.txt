Quantities are equal in I. and IIL, but energies are unequal ; the blaze effects are unequal.
Energies are equal in II. and III., but quantities are unequal ; the blaze effects are approximately equal.
Norr.—The rate of discharge, as shown in the column V/F in IIL has been eight times that in I.

I have not yet obtained satisfactory measurements of minimum energy of excitation
giving maximum energy of blaze effect. But I have repeatedly had occasion to
recognise this principal point, that the energy of the excited effect may be in excess
of the energy of the exciting cause.

Excessive stimulation, so far from giving a larger, gives a smaller blaze effect than
does moderate stimulation. And I have repeatedly been struck by the fact that a
single over-strong stimulus not only diminishes the blaze effect provoked by a subse-
quent moderate stimulus, but that the effect of the excessive stimulus is itself far
short of the effect caused by a moderate stimulus. One might have expected that
the final explosion provoked by the excessive stimulus should itself be excessive, but
one finds that such excessive stimulus, by injury of tissue, sets a limit to the effect
which itself produces.

The development of a blaze effect is sudden ; its decline is gradual. The culmina-
tion appears to outstrip the rate of progress of the deflected galvanometer mirror,
more clearly so in the case of a heterodrome than in that of a homodrome blaze. This
difference when present is due to polarisation counter-current present in the two cases,
which counter-current somewhat accelerates the culmination of heterodrome blaze,
