which represents irrotational motion except in the vortices, there remain vibrational

In a region in which the velocity of translation (uw, v, w) is uniform, the radiation
is thus simply carried on by the motion of the medium.
99. The vibrational motion which is propagated from an atom is interlinked with
the motion of translation of the medium, only through the hydrostatic pressures
which must be made continuous across an interface; the form of the free surface has
fact to be determined so as to adjust these pressures at each instant. ‘To fix
ideas, let us consider for a moment the problem of the vibrations of a single ring
ith vacuous core, moving by itself through the medium, in the direction of its axis,
ith a given atomic electric charge on it. To obtain a solution we assume that the
adius vector of the cross section of the core varies with the time according to the
harmonic function suitable to its types of simple vibration’; and we determine the
irrotational motion in the medium that is produced by this motion of the surface of
the core, and calculate the pressure p, at the free surface. Next we determine the
ibrational rotation (f, g, h) that is conditioned by the same vibratory movement of
he surface of the core, while it is independent of the inertia of the hydrodynamical
motion in the medium; this has also to satisfy the condition that the tangential
components of the rotation are null all over the surface, so that there may be no
electromotive tangential traction on it. In order to satisfy all these surface conditions
