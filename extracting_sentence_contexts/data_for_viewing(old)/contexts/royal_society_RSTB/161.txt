The recognition of this delay is equivalent to the admission that existing methods
of observation are inadequate, for it implies that with the best known methods of
investigation there is an interval of time left unoccupied by any of the known
phenomena of functional activity. The existence of a real time of rest in the
molecular processes of the excitatory state, when these processes pass from nerve-
trunks into nerve-end organs, is not scientifically admissible.

The apparent resting time may, perhaps, be considered as time during which
these molecular processes are being transmitted along the excitable tissue very
slowly. The blocking of the excitatory process in cardiac tissue by pressure, &c.,
is acase in point, The Torpedo presents us with a similar phenomenon, and this in

largest, and therefore the most easily appreciated, vital electromotive change which
has up to this time been examined by the rheotome method. The extraordinary
prolongation of the delay by cold, although apparently connected with the condition
of the nerve endings, may, however, be at least partially accounted for by the
increased time of transmission down the nerve branches contained in the organ itself.
It is hoped that an early opportunity will afford means for ascertaining to what
extent this is the case.
