Br? +-n2V?2 = fr vV2>0, (8-42-8)

and is obtained when all damping and Magnus coefficients are neglected. For then G(s)
is real and equal to n? +fr?/V, and this clearly must be positive if the yaw equation (4-3-8)
is to have stable solutions. Alternatively we may deduce (8-42: 8) from (8-41-6). For if we
put ¢ = 0 and neglect all damping and Magnus terms, we obtain G, = 0, G; = G,, and

hence, since G(s) 40, G,(s) = n2V2+4f%r?>0.

We now consider Condition B of § 8-41. The expression (8-41-13) is of the order of magni-
tude of the angular deviation due to gravity,t and is therefore small during burning, by
our assumptions. Accordingly Condition B does not apply to the motion of a rocket during
burning, and, in fact, will only be of importance over arcs of the trajectory over which the
gravity drop is appreciable. For such arcs the assumptions regarding the smallness of Z
are, of course, not valid, and we are therefore not strictly justified in applying the formulae
of §8-2 in order to examine stability. The modifications which are necessary in order to
make the theory applicable to the whole trajectory have, however, only a minor effect upon
the stability conditions, since the yaw will still be expressible as a sum of parts 3, 5 and
=i?, and S\ will still be of the form (8-41-11). The functions k,(u,s) and k,(u, s), although still
slowly varying or monotonic, will, of course, be no longer independent of @ and ¥ (see, for
example, Chapter 12 of Kelley, McShane & Reno (1949?)). It will therefore be possible to
draw similar conclusions regarding the stability of the motion.

Accordingly, we proceed to examine Condition B in the case when the gravity drop is
