reaction—diffusion systems, such as patterns which are advected by the flow [163], modification
of phases between activator and inhibitor [164], and pattern formation due to differential-flow
without the need for differential diffusion [165]. Such systems can admit both stationary and
travelling waves [166]. Reaction-advection-diffusion systems are examples of equation (2.6) only
in the case when the ratio of advection to diffusion is the same between each species, as
otherwise the system cannot be written or analysed via a scalar operator C. Even when this is
possible, and the system can be studied via the spectrum of L, the spectrum will typically be
more complicated due to the loss of self-adjointness of £, which allows complex eigenvalues
and a loss of spectral discreteness in general (depending on the boundary conditions used)

[21]. Reaction-advection-diffusion systems have been studied outside of this regime (that is, : =
when the systems cannot be written using a scalar operator £), though there is limited analysis : =
possible from the perspective of linear instability. This is due to the fact that the theory of 1B
matrix operators, particularly when they are not self-adjoint, is not nearly as well-developed : =

issues. : 3

Other transport models beyond the form of equation (2.6) include those with nonlinear :3
diffusion [167,168], chemotaxis and related directed-motion models ([4], Ch. 5), [128,169-171], and : Ss
cross-diffusion systems [172-175]. We also mention hyperbolic extensions of reaction—diffusion :s
systems, developed to account for the finite speed of propagation of real particles [77,176], though ‘8

we remark that Turing-type instabilities in such systems typically exhibit nearly identical patterns
in the same parameter regimes as their purely parabolic counterparts. However, these hyperbolic
systems also admit oscillatory instabilities (sometimes called Turing—Wave instabilities) where a
