Washington 1896). Chemically they differ little from some of the
hornblende-bandaites, and many contain minute traces of resorbed hornblende. These
hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always contains
green hornblende, that highly glassy rocks more often contain green hornblende than
brown, and that pyroxene-bandaites are very seldom even slightly porous, and never
form pumice. By those who believe in gravitative differentiation, and possibly even by some sup-
porters of the assimilation hypothesis, the olivine-basalt magma of Montserrat, as
compared with the bandaite magma, may be regarded as having been derived from
a lower part of the main magma reservoir of the Caribbean arc. Like many other
areas, Montserrat provides no decisive evidence on the major problems of differentia-
tion.
