otherwise, of the proposed system from the practical point of view.

The trigonometrical method, however, from the designer’s point of view, has the
radical defect that, while it gives partial information about the performance of a given
system, it gives no direct intimation of the direction in which the elimination of various
detects is to be looked for, and it entails a long and laborious process of seeking for
the optimum by trial and error.

The object of the authors of the present paper has been to develop a method of
expressing the aberrations, which, while carrying the algebraic development to a
stage including the second order, should be free from certain grave troubles involved
by failure of convergency, troubles which appear to have been hitherto neglected.
In fact this method gives numerical results that, for a single lens, are considerably
more accurate than the ordinary second order formule. Further, these methods
enable’ one to deal, ina comparatively easier form, with the problem of the second order
aberrations of combinations of surfaces and systems, a problem which, so far as we
know, has never been attacked from any general standpoint. Kornic and Von Rour
(Von Rour, ‘Theorie der Optischen Instrumente,’ Cap. V.) give a development of a
formula for the coefficients of first order and second order in the longitudinal spherical
aberration, based on ABBE’s method of Invariants, but so far as can be seen, no definite
results are obtained for the second order terms. I

Dennis Taytor (‘System of Applied Optics, p. 67) gives a formula for the
spherical aberration, developed in powers of the intercept made by the ray on the
first principal plane, which includes terms of second order. But his formula, a
