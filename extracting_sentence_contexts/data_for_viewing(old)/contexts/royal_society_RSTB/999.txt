Much of this work is very much in accord with my own results, but appears to
short at my Stage IV. The period of growth is fully described, but the perio
degeneration is not completed, the swelling of the stroma, increase of vessels, t
congestion and hemorrhage due to hypertrophy and degenerative causes (not fi
degeneration, however) being described in the account I have given above,
S. entellus. j

I fully agree with these authors that the rupture of the vessels is ultimately du
degeneration, but cannot go so far as to say it is not primarily due to congest
hyperemia undoubtedly precedes the rupture of the vessels, and there seems
good reason to suppose that a state of congestion is naturally followed by degenerai
of the walls of the vessels and the surrounding tissue. The fact that incre
hyperemia exists in pregnant uteri without hsemorrhage, may be readily accoun
for by the presence of the embryonic membranes over the surface of the uterus.

MonickeE (50) is more emphatic in his statement that the mucous membran
neither partly nor wholly cast off during menstruation. He says that the in
glandular stroma is not increased, and that fatty degeneration, except perhaps
trifling degree, is never shown. He also describes an increase in the homogene
ground substance of the mucosa, and states that the vessels enlarge, become fi
with blood, and there is an occurrence of extravasation of blood in the upper laye
the mucosa.

This author, then, does not appear to distinguish a period of growth of the s
