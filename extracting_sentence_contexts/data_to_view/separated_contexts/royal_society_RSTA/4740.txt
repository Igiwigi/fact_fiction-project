To avoid requiring some implausible conspiracy, the nee)
physicist may conclude that there may be a retrocausal effect by which information, associated :
with the decay of the radioactive atom, propagates back in time causing the black hole event [4
horizon to expand at earlier times. DN

However, in this case, there is a simple explanation for the correlation which requires neither [sz
conspiracy nor retrocausality. The explanation lies in the fact that #+ is defined by a global :&
property of space-time, it being the boundary of null surfaces that escape to .%*. Consistent .
with this, the location r(to) of #* cannot be determined by the geometry of space-time in
the neighbourhood of * at fo. Hence, the correlation is explainable without conspiracy or
retrocausality.
