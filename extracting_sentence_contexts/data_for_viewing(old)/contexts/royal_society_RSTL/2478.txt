I now proceed to the detail of the experiments, and the
conclusions I draw from them. In those which I shall first
describe, the centre of the plate was always in the magnetic
meridian ; its plane was perpendicular to the meridian, and a
tangent to the sphere, whose centre was the centre of the

needle; and the plate revolved, as-in!all-other cases, in
its own- plane : they: area repetition! of. those! by. which I
first discovered several of the-facts; Irhave, mentioned, but

indicate the points of the plate which coincided with the plane
of the meridian nearest/ the:/s0outh; or upper/pole-of the
