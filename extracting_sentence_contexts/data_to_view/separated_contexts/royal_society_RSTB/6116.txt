ON CLIMATE AND TSETSE FLIES 225

Season—The range of temperature is much greater in April than in July ; the
following figures give the mean daily range (° C) in the four places :—

Gadau No. 3 No. 1 No. 4
ADH oie cap hins 16-2 17-0 18-8 15-0
J Spar sian 9-5 9-8 9-2 6-7

The fact that the range is less in July is due in the main to a lower maximum. For
instance, at Gadau the maximum in July is 8-5° lower than in April, whereas the
minimum is only 1-7° lower. c

Local differences—The temperature of Gadau differs very little from that at Screen 3
in the open country.
