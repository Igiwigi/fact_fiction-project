(4) (a) Mercury Green. Hg 5460°97. In reading rotations of large magnitude it is impossible to use sodium light as a
standard, owing to the fact that the lines D, and D, are not extinguished together,
the difference amounting in the experiments now described to 8° for the dextro-quartz
and 11° for the levo-quartz column. It was, therefore, necessary to adopt some other
light for the purpose of making stringent tests on the quartz blocks before attempting
measurements of rotatory dispersion. For this purpose the green mercury line was
selected.
