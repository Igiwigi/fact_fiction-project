Usually the
spot position varied by 10 to 100mm for 1°C change in room temperature. This rapid

"variation resulted from a considerable degree of magnetic control due to magnetic impurities
in the constructional materials of the magnetometer case. The large magnitude of the effect
was somewhat surprising, but was probably due to the fact that the equilibrium position

f the anti-vibration suspension is very sensitive to temperature. A shift of this position
alters the spatial relation of the magnetometer itself to the slightly magnetic parts of the
ase surrounding it, and so alters the zero position of the spot.

a. 3-2. Field compensating coils

% In order to be able to carry out experiments in a nearly field-free space, three pairs of

‘Helmholtz coils were placed around the magnetometer to compensate the north-south
omponent H of the earth’s field, the vertical component V and the east-west component E.
6The radii of the three pairs of coils to compensate H, V and E are 115, 107 and 100cm
Etespectively ; each coil had two windings of 160 turns each, a main winding of 20s.w.g.
copper wire and a subsidiary winding of 30s.w.g.
