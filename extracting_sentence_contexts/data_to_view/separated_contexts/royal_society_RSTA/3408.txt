We also remark (see [16] for details) that, in this case, the phases are constrained

However, the transition probability matrix (M) that we computed in §2c(i) is not satisfying double
stochasticity. Expansion (4.3) and (4.4) has the following probabilistic form:

fi=Jpiiei + /pi2e2 (5.4)
and
h= elt /paier + el” /p22€2- (5.5)
Hence,
h= Jin b= Vp d=e ypu and dy) =e! /ppp. (5.6) <

As we stressed, the transition probabilities on voting preferences (and in fact data from
psychological studies; cf. [16]) are not doubly stochastic. Next, we find the components Qj of the
generalized quantum observable B = (Q;, Q2). From expressions (4.14) and (4.15) and by taking
into account the probabilistic form of the coefficients (5.6), we obtain

1 p22 —/p2i1p22 eiAn
Q= ra ( “ia ) , (5.15)

To calculate the absolute value of the sum, one can use the formula

la- bed? =? +l — 2abcos A,

15In the case of the double stochastic matrix of transition probabilities, the above expressions can be essentially simplified.
