The negative terms corresponding to m = 3 in the D series, and to m = 1°5 in the
S series (the latter giving the first P doublet), are given very erroneously by the
formule, as is so often the case in the more familiar series. Nevertheless,
LorenserR has fully established the connection of the F with the D_ series,
through the usual relations, to which reference has already been made. There
is sufficient evidence that the lines in question are to be regarded as enhanced
lines, and, though Lorenser does not appear to have recognised this fact, his
work proved that enhanced lines may form groups of related series which are
generally similar to those occurring in are spectra, but require modifications of the
usual formule. Tt will be observed that in Lorensrr’s formule the numerator is of the order of
4N as in those already found for the Mg “4481” series, and the question arises
whether 4N may not be the universal constant for enhanced lines, as N is universal
for series of lines produced under less violent excitation. The series are not long
enough to give a very satisfactory comparison of the relative accuracy of different
formule, but, so far as it goes, the evidence is distinctly in favour of the Hicks
formula with 4N for the numerator.
