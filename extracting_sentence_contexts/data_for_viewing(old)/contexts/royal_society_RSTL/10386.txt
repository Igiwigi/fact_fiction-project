firmation, inasmuch as leakage of electricity from the main circuit into the galvano-
meter branch would exert a different influence in the two cases. The observations
were not reduced until some time afterwards, and it then appeared that the agreement
was even better than it would have been reasonable to expect.
$15. The final number, 9867 x 10%, expressing the value of the B.A, unit in
absolute measure as determined by these two series of observations, is almost identical
with that previously obtained by ourselves, and by GLAZEBROOK, using other methods,
With respect to the independence of these determinations, the only thing calling for
notice is the fact that the same induction coils were employed both by GLazeBROOK
+ and in the present investigation. In other respects there has been, we believe,
S searcely any point of contact. But it is evident that an error in the measurements
© of mean radius of these coils must propagate itself into both results. The point to
Z which we now wish to direct attention, is that the error of mean radius will influence
the final number in opposite directions. In the method employed by GLAazEBROOK, an
© under-estimate of the mean radins would lead to an under-estimate of the induction
2 coefficient, whereas with us it would lead to an over-estimate of that quantity. 80 far,
S therefore, as the error of mean radius is concerned, it would appear that the use of the
Z game coils is far from impairing the value of the results. Even with respect to the
Z number of turns, an error, if that be supposed possible, would affect the results in a
E different manner, for GLAZEBROOK was concerned with the product of the numbers for
3 the two coils, while we evidently are concerned with the sm,
