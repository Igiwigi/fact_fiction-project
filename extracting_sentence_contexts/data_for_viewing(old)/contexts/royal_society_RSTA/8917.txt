had in hand. It might naturally be feared that some mistake might have been made
either in principle or in detail, and it must be remembered that even one mistake
might invalidate the answer to the whole problem. I have, therefore, both here and
elsewhere, taken the utmost care to check the accuracy of my work in every way.
The following will, I think, show that no error need be feared in the solution which
has just been obtained.

The value of V,, if obtained accurately, ought to satisfy V’°V; = —4zp, and the term
—4rp must come entirely from the terms independent of ¢ in V, Thus the terms in
V, which are multiplied by e, ¢? and e* ought separately to be spherical harmonics.

It was verified in the previous paper that the terms in e and e* were in actual
fact of this form, The terms in e* will be harmonic if the quantity on the right of
equation (57) is harmonic, and the conditions for this are expressed by the equations

I have inserted the values just obtained for ty, t», ...0;, ... in these equations, and
have verified that they are all satisfied. (The necessary transformations of the various
integrals are tedious, but involve no special difficulties.)
