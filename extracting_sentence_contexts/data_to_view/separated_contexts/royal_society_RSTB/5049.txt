(2) That the system commences in an open network in the
mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx, and gills, receiving its contents through
small-valved connectives from a fine network of lymph capillaries situated close beneath
the mucous epithelium. (3) That from this origin its vessels are distributed alongside
the ordinary (efferent) lymphatics throughout the anterior part of the body to the
arteries, connective tissues and skin, and that probably (though of this I have little
direct evidence) in these areas of distribution its terminal networks connect up with
the terminal branches of the ordinary lymphatics, and thus through them complete
the path of circulation, returning the lymph from the periphery vid the ventral system
of lymphatics to the sub-thyroid and thyroid sinuses and thence to the heart. The fact that I have not seen any parts of this system of ‘fine ”’ vessels distributed
to the alimentary viscera makes me hesitate to agree with Mayer that it serves to

carry nutrient matter from the digestive organs to the periphery ; but, on the other
hand, its wide distribution upon the mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx and
gills—where, as JouRDAIN points out, its terminal factors would be in as’ close
association with the water as are the branchial respiratory vessels—suggests that
possibly its contents may here take up some constituent of the water and convey
it to the walls of the blood-vessels and lymph sinuses, and to the skin. This suggestion
is possibly supported by the fact that a complete two-way circulation of lymph is,
so far as known, peculiar to fishes, and does not occur in land Vertebrates, the flow in
them being in one direction only—from the periphery to the heart.
