© Take a frosshe (frog) and put it in asa fetida, and
caste it in the water wyth a corde and a corke, and ye shall
not fayl of hym. And yf ye lyst to have a good sporte,
thenne tye the corde to a gose fote ; and ye shall se gode
halynge whether the gose or the pyke shall have the better.”
Walton, and every subsequent writer on angling, has given


submazillary odoriferous gland in the genus Crocodilus, 137

receipts for the composition of pastes for the same purpose»
in all of which tar, assa foetida, camphor, oil of rhodium,
musk, or some other powerful odour is the most important
ingredient. These facts strikingly coincide with the mode in which the
alligators take their prey, as far as the observations I had an
opportunity of making on those in my possession enable me
to judge. This is done by suddenly snapping at it sideways,
a mode perfectly consistent with the form of the mouth and
the position of the eyes, and not less so with the situation of
the gland itself, the secretion from which, would attract the
fish directly to that part where they would become the most
certain and easy prey. From all these circumstances then I
am led to conclude, that the use of this secretion is to serve
as an attractive bait for fish, which form the principal food of
these animals.
