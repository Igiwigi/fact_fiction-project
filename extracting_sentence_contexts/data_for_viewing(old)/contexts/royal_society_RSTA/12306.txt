z= 10 centims., would require a velocity u = 2Vs/nz = (4 x 1010 x 10-4)/10 == 4 x 10Â° centims. pe

be used to diminish the required thickness.

53. There is rather a nice point to be considered in connexion with change (2),
viz., what the pitch, as perceived, really depends on. The coarse statement of exa
tion candidates that it depends on wave-length, or on the frequency of vibration
source, is of course not true; it depends on the frequency of disturbance reaching
receiver. This fact is suggested by listening or looking through a different m
wherein the wave-length is quite different ; though, indeed, it must be admitted
the medium in ear or eye cannot be changed. It is proved (for the case of sou

t) by travelling towards the source, when the observed rise of pitch must be caused
ereased frequency of arrival, the wave-length remaining unaltered.

But when we consider the effect observed in a spectroscope, there might possibly be
jifference according as its essential part was a grating or a prism.
