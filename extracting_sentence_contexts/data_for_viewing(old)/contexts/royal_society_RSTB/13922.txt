the difference between opponents in the values of F, the
higher the probability of winning for the individual with
the larger F. Simulations clearly demonstrated that initially
subtle differences between individuals became amplified
towards the formation of a linear dominance hierarchy in a
self-organizing manner.

The classic model of Bonabeau eft al. [64] can be extended
in various ways by incorporating features observed in real
colonies. First, the assumption of the constant shift of F; per
interaction can be modified to reflect the empirical obser-
vations that the memory of losing is better retained than
that of winning [63,65-67]. Incorporating this fact might con-
tribute to better stability of the dominance hierarchy. Second,
F; and 6 can change intrinsically depending on an individ-
ual’s age. This modification could explain how an
individual’s age is often associated with her ranking in the
dominance hierarchy in eusocial Hymenoptera [20,31,34,35].
Third, the birth and death of individuals during the mainten-
ance phase, which were not incorporated in the model of
Bonabeau et al. [64], can act as a destabilizing force to the

hierarchy. How these factors affect the process of reinforcement
deserves further theoretical consideration.
