Two apparatuses in cascade correspond to the
sequential composition {B;Aj}(i)exxy C Transf(A > C) of the two tests A= (Ailiex C Transf(A >
B) and B:= {Bj}icy C Transf(B > C). Here, test A belongs to the past cone of test B, and vice versa
test B belongs to the future cone of test A. Using the rules of quantum theory, we have the causality
relations

where we used the fact that the coarse-graining By := ) icy Bj is trace-preserving (true also
for Ax). One can now consider X = {0,1} with Tr[Ao(e)] =0. Then, for example, the causality
principle would be falsified if, upon changing test B to a different test Bâ€™, one would have the
occurrence of the outcome 0 for test A.

(f) From Cinderella to principle of physics

The causality principle that here we have derived as a theorem of quantum theory, in [13,14]
has been used instead as the first of six information-theoretical postulates to derive quantum
theory in finite dimensions (a didactical derivation can be found in the textbook [15]).
