MRS. H. AYRTON ON THE MECHANISM OF THE ELECTRIC ARC, B25

carbon were composed entirely of core, and the other, D E F, connecting the rise of
P.D., due to the increase of the specific resistance, with the current. The curve
connecting the true P.D. with the current is found by adding each ordinate of D E F
to the corresponding ordinate of A B C, as indicated in the dotted line. Whether
this resulting curve has the form GH K, or MN P, or QRS (fig. 12) depends,
evidently, upon the relation between the increase of the cross-section and the rise of
specific resistance, Ã©.c., on the relative structures and cross-sections of the core and
the outer carbon.

The fact, already obtained from Table IV., that, for the same current and length
of are, the vapour film, and, consequently, the crater, is smaller with a cored than
with a solid positive carbon, explains why the are can carry such a much larger
current without hissing when the positive carbon is cored than when it is solid. For
T have shown* that hissing is the result of that direct contact of the crater with the
air which follows when the crater grows too large to cover the end only of the
positive carbon and so extends along its sides, and this must happen with a smaller
current the larger the crater is with a given current, i.e, it must happen with a
smaller current when the positive carbon is solid than when it is cored.

How the Change in the Cross-Sections of the Mist und the Vapour Film, due to
a Change of Current, is Affected by Coring Either ov Both Carbons.
