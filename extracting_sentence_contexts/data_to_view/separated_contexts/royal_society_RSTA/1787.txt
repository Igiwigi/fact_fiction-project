Attempts to fit these numbers to an interpolation formula of the type

l=a+ ba + ca? +...

where I is the intensity and « the cathode distance, are not successful. It is in fact
evident from the later members of the sequence that the law is partly exponential. The sequence of logarithms of intensity is found to be, to base 10,

1°17, 1:68, 1°69, b64,. 88> Beso aneacs

and these also, especially when the dark space is included, do not fit well into an
interpolation formula of the above type.
