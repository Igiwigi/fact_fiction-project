It reduces the risk of security breaches against unauthorized devices (e.g. external sensors)
and unknown data sources. In this sense, security-related services are needed in the plant-wide
monitoring system. For the DT-powered services, the attractive aspect lies in the fact that the companies do not
have to bother developing dedicated software and solutions for various online analysis needs. They just need to turn to the market of third-party service providers and instruct the digital
twins to ‘use the apps’. By doing so, more opportunities are available to compare and change
the solutions based on different approaches (e.g. deep learning-based versus subspace-based
versus principle model-based fault detection approaches).
