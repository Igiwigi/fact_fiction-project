study the shear rate dependence of the A2 unfolding rate, and, following the pioneering work of

Katz and co-workers [54], of domains separation.

4. Conclusion

In summary, using a multiscale simulation method that represents water and proteins at the
mesoscopic level paves the way for studying massive macromolecular systems composed
of thousands of proteins. Such a possibility has already been explored by using specialized
computational infrastructure made of thousands of GPUs [55].

Importantly, the LBMD computational scheme offers an original approach to multiscale
simulations. In fact, the multi-resolution lattice Boltzmann scheme is today available [56], as much
as devising methods where the particle resolution is handled differently in different regions of the
system [57-59] and, in essence, allowing to handle situations where both the fluid and particle
components cross the scale boundaries.

Data accessibility. The files containing the processed Protein Databank structures relative to CI2, amyloid
peptides and the A2 domain of VWF and containing the OPEP force field parameters are publicly available
upon request to the authors. The trajectories of the simulated systems are also made available to users upon
request to the authors and for file size not exceeding 10 GB.
