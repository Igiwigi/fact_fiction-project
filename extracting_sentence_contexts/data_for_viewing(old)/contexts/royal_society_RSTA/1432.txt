discussed in ยง4c, which allows performing more advanced semi-intrusive algorithms. In
particular, we plan to train a metamodel on the fly and combine that with a cross-validation test
of the effect of the approximation error on the results of the micro model.

(g) Coronavirus modelling

Since 2019, the world has been severely affected by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,
and the COVID-19 disease it causes. Although many models are able to approximate the viral


spread on the national level, few solutions are available to forecast the spread on a local level,
e.g. in towns or city boroughs. Within the HiDALGO project!* we are working on the Flu And
Coronavirus Simulator (FACS)! to help address this challenge.

We use VECMAtk primarily to systematically validate the code, analyse parameter
sensitivities, execute ensemble simulations to account for aleatory uncertainty in the code, and
to easily produce ensemble forecasts which involve a wide range of scenarios, applied to a range
of boroughs in London.

To achieve this, we primarily rely on FabCovid19, which is a FabSim3 plugin, as well as
QCG-PJ. Both tools combined allow us to automate these tasks, and seamlessly create, run and
post-process ensemble simulations. We also use EasyVVUQ to analyse parameter sensitivities. To
demonstrate in what way the VECMA toolkit adds value to our application in a concrete way, we
present an small example sensitivity analysis study in appendix B.
