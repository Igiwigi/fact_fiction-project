Professor ExrexzeRe's description and figures of Orbiculina,
however, being just as inaccurate as I have shown those of Orbitolites to be (partly,
it seems likely, through his unacquaintance with the mode of making thin sections),
there is no occasion for me to make further reference to them.

81. The excellent memoir of Professor WiLL1amsoNnF © On the minute structure of
the Calcareons Shells of some recent species of. Foraminifera,” contains the first
approach to a correct description of the internal conformation of Orbiculina ; and
the fact was fully recognized by him, that in advanced age, when the spiral type of
growth has given place to the cyclical, there is no other difference between the
structure of Orbitolites and that of Orbiculina, than that which arises from the dis-
Similarity of their earlier mode of development. Although I am satisfied that, as to
one or two points of minute structure, Professor WiLLIawsox has fallen into error, I
am disposed to attribute this to the want of a sufficient number of well-preserved
specimens for examination ; and for having it in my power to correct and extend his
description, I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Hucx Coumixe, the specimens of this type
included in bis Philippine collection being remarkable both for their high develop-
ment, and for their very beautiful state of preservation.
