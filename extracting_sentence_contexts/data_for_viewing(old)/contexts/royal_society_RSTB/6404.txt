their own way in the development of the exoskeleton, oral apparatus, and the forma-
tion of a single branchial opening.

The position of the Anaspids is intermediate between the Pteraspids and
Cephalaspids, for the presence in them of pectoral spines suggests that they had
pectoral fins and lost them, and this and the fact that the movement forwards

* The action of the heterocercal tail in modern sharks is also counterbalanced to some extent by the
upward tilting of the snout, but the presence of pectoral fins is the major factor in the control of direction.

and upwards of the naso-hypophyseal pore had probably already started before they
branched from the main stem, indicates that their, common ancestry with the
Cephalaspids was longer than that of the Pteraspids. If so, we may expect to find
their exoskeletal micro-structure more nearly resembling that of the Osrgosrract.
Their acquisition of a hypocercal caudal fin was probably later than that of the
