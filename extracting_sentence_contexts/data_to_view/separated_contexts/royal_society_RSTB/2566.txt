In Zurbinaria, the pali grow upward from the fused ends of a primary
and a secondary septum, the same is true of Porites. But the pali in Porites are
small and round and not lamellar, hence a transverse section may cut one, two, or
even three pali in the same radial line, the individual pali having taken origin
successively and attained various stages of growth, As explained under Turbinara,
subsequent calcareous deposit may block up the spaces originally present between
the pali and septum in one radial line and give the appearance of one continuous
compact radial structure extending from the mural area to the centre of the calyx. Then the radial structure looks very like an Astreid septum, and the resemblance
is still more heightened by the fact that the individual pali appear on the lateral
surfaces like ridges jutting out from the compacting calcareous tissue. On the other hand, even after a secondary deposit of calcareous tissue has been
laid down, it may happen that apertures are left unfilled between the septum and
pali. Thus, in systematic descriptions, the radial structure in Porites has usually
been regarded as perforate, and Pratz placed the Poritine, E.H. (loc. cit,
‘ Paleontographica,’ 1882, pp. 122-123), amongst the Microsolenid members of the
Pseudoastreeine.
