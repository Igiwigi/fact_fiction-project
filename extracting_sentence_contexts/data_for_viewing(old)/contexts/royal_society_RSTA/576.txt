2010-2040 off the Miyagi prefecture—off the Sendai and Onagawa—(west of the 2011 event),
and 80-90% for an M ~ 7.7 event, close to where the 2011 earthquake occurred. The 1933 M ~ 8.5
(M ~ 8.1 [16,22]) Sanriku earthquake was the only known normal faulting earthquake pre-2011
generating a tsunami in Japan [22] in the literature, and its 30 year repetition probability was
estimated as 4-7%.

For perspective in the subsequent discussion, it is useful to recall the 17 July 1993 Hokkaido
Nansei-oki tsunami that devastated the island of Okushiri in the Sea of Japan. It was triggered by
an M ~7.7 earthquake, with estimated 10-18ms~! overland flow velocities and extreme 30m
run-up in one location [24]. Towns in Okushiri had been protected by a 4.5m high seawall,
constructed in the aftermath of the 26 May 1983 tsunami. They were overtopped at places by an
11m tsunami flood [25]. Shuto & Fujima [25] stated that ‘This fact called for serious reflection to
the conventional method after 1960 that relied mainly on structures’. The event generated a high-
quality inundation dataset in a geographical setting where a fairly accurate determination of the
seafloor motion could be made post facto. The latter is important because tsunami predictions can
only be as good as the estimates of the source characteristics that produced them, i.e. the estimates
of the initial condition for the hydrodynamic simulations. This Okushiri tsunami became the
most useful benchmark for numerical codes that purport to predict tsunami inundation. In its
aftermath, Japan spent over US$600M (in 1998) to build an 11 m high seawall, to rebuild the main
town of Aonae, and to protect about 20 km of coastlines. Even so, its population dwindled from
4679 in 1993 to 3160 in 2012 [26].

The fact that Japan spent an average of approximately US$130K per Okushiri resident
expressed a commitment to tsunami hazard mitigation, which unfortunately the 11 March 2011
