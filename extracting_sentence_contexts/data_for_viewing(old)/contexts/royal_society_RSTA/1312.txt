Here we must choose a real root that defines a decreasing behaviour of w from 1 to 0 as x4
increases.

Thus, expressions (3.13), (3.17) and (3.19)-(3.23) represent the analytical solutions written out
in a parametric form. The behaviour of these solutions is illustrated in figures 1 and 2 for the
Meirs nucleation kinetics in the case of pure Ti. Figure 1 shows the parametric solutions w and f'
as functions of the parameter x1, which plays the role of parametric variable. Note that the melt
supercooling w decreases and time ¢’ increases with increasing x1. Eliminating the parametric
dependence of w on x1, we illustrate w versus the real dimensionless time ¢ in figure 2. A
decreasing dynamics of w on ¢’ takes place due to the release of latent heat of solidification,
which compensates the current metastability degree. The particle-size distribution function F
demonstrated in figure 2 evolves with time (’, its maximum shifts into larger crystal radii and its
bell-shaped curve broadens as time increases. This is explained by the fact that crystals continue
to nucleate and grow at large and moderate supercooling w.

An important conclusion is that the unsteady-state growth rate (2.10), as well as the Gibbs—
Thomson effect, substantially influence the dynamics of a particulate assemblage (compare the
solid and dotted curves illustrated in figures 1 and 2). Taking these effects into account, the liquid
metastability w lies essentially below the corresponding metastability for the steady-state growth
rate and in the absence of the Gibbs-Thomson phenomenon. In other words, desupercooling
occurs faster with allowance for the generalized growth rate (2.10). As this takes place, the
resultant distribution function is higher and its maximum point is shifted to the left (compare
the solid and dashed distributions shown in figure 2 at a fixed point in time). As is easily seen in
