acid. acid. This remarkable peculiarity in the constitution of the radicals of natural or analytically
obtained organic compounds, must be the expression of some general law regulating the
formation of those compounds, and which cannot much longer elude detection. Intimately connected with isomerism in the fatty acids is the like phenomenon in the
alcohols which has recently been remarked by KoLBEfF and by FRIeDELt; in fact the syn-
thesis of the carboketonic ethers and of the fatty acids lays open a direct path, through
the beautiful reactions either of Mtxpius or FRIEDEL, to corresponding alcohols. In conclusion, there can be no doubt that the reaction which forms the subject of this
paper is capable of a very wide extension, and that by its means we shall be able to
ascend many of the well-recognized homologous series. In future communications we
hope to have the honour of laying before the Royal Society the results of its extension to
the alcohols and ethers, and to the benzoic series of ethereal salts.
