As expected, the DMBE/ES/SS-(2 + 3) PES provides a realistic representation of the potential
both in the valence and long-range interaction regions. In fact, as figures 16a and 17a show,
the current DMBE has the correct asymptotic behaviour, which is a well-established asset of
MBE theory [119,123-125]. It should be stressed that although the truncated potentials give a
good representation of the triplet linear global minimum, 1-C4C Xe ) is predicted to be a saddle
point of index 4, with imaginary frequencies corresponding to the degenerate trans-(w4) and
cis-bending (ws) modes. This result stems largely from the lack of the four-body term which,
according to figure 15a and the DMBE/ES/SS-(2 + 3) PES, is estimated to be as repulsive as
376k} mol™! at this geometry. Similar magnitudes of four-body interaction energies have been
reported for X4-type elemental clusters such as Hy [120,185] and Oy [186]. In fact, for ground-
state C3, the three-body energy is known [35,116,185] to strongly favour the linear structure:
it is attractive in this region, but repulsive (or less attractive) as the molecule bends, in such a
way as to counteract the increased attraction of the two-body terms. Thus, at D3, geometries, a
minimum of the latter is accompanied by a maximum in energy of the former. Ongoing from C3
to C4, the two-body terms are doubled in number, while the three-body terms are quadrupled.
If the four-body energy is ignored a priori, one expects, therefore, an over-stabilization of the
linear structure due to the three-body terms, with highly symmetric geometries such as Ty forms
being greatly destabilized. Obviously, there are cases in which the gain in two-body energy on
passing from chains to rings will compensate for the loss of three-body interaction so that cyclic
structures can be almost isoenergetic or even more stable than 1-C4C Ze ). However, such forms
are predicted from our ab initio calculations to be high-lying stationary structures on the triplet
ground-state PES. This is mostly attributed to the generally repulsive nature of the four-body
