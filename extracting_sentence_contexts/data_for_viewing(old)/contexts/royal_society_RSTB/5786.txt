those made after the isolations of I,, it was found that in the isolations of the first group
the amounts of the stipular areas of P, left on the apex were actually, for the most part,
considerably greater than in those of the second group, as can be seen from Table I,
column 3. The parts of the stipular areas of P, also that were left on the apex did
not develop by themselves in the experiments here reported, and it is probable that they
also were invaded to some extent by the central part of the second younger primordium
(1,). For it can be seen from the diagram (fig. 9) that they must have been invaded
whenever the second primordium was displaced towards the wound, as it was usually
found to have been, though less far than after isolation of I,. Moreover, in the first
group of isolations of P,, in which the amounts of stipular area left on the apex were
greater, the displacements of I, were also usually distinctly greater (see Table I), and
so also on the average were the angles between I, and I,. This difference may, however,
not have been due to the fact that in the first group more of the stipular area of P, was

left on the apex. The explanation may be that the cuts, being closer to the central part
of P,, presumably did not extend so far up the apex above P,, and so allowed the stipule
of I, to extend farther into the region above the wound. Or again, both factors may
have contributed.

Even in the first group of isolations of P,, the second primordium (1,) was usually
