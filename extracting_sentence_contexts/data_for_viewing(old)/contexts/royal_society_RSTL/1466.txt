muscles. | It may, perhaps, be urged, that the heat to which
I exposed the lens may have changet its structure : in answer
to that I observe, it was moderate in degree, and regularly
applied ; of consequence we may presume, as it appeared uni-
formly opaque, that every part was alike acted upon ; but by
boiling the lens. where the heat is, without doubt, regularly
applied, we observe the same structure.

Thirdly, that it is not from any changes of the lens, and
that this is not the most essential organ in viewing objects at
different distances, we may also infer from this undeniable
fact, that we can, in a great degree, do without it ; as after
couching or extraction, by which operations all its parts must
be destroyed, capsule, ciliary processes, muscles, &c.

Mr. Youxs asserts, from the authority of Dr. PorRTER-

of objects; at present, I believe the contrary fact is almost
