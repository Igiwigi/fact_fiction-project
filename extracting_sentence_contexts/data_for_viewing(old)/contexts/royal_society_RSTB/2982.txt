THE PALAMOZOIC SEED, LAGENOSTOMA LOMAXI. 211

thus appears that these peripheral strands are either endarch or very nearly so, the
amount of centripetal xylem being, at the best, trifling. Some of the narrow
elements shown accompanying the xylem in fig. 6 may be phlo√©m, but we are unable
to speak confidently as to this part of the bundle as the indications are so slight.

In nearly all cases in which the structure of the peripheral bundles is shown in
longitudinal section, and especially in those cases in which spiral elements have been
recognised, it is in the lower part of their course. This is hardly to be explained as
being due to the greater dimensions of the bundle below than above. It may
perhaps be correlated with the fact that the upper part of the seed undergoes a
relatively late extension. The only ground for this suggestion is the fact that the
plinth is wanting in the small abortive seeds (phot. 2), so that in passing from the
small to the full grown dimensions there must have been considerable intercalation in
that particular zone of the seed.

The Abortive Seeds.

Besides the full-sized specimens, having approximate dimensions 54 X 44 millims.,
there are the small, though in many respects mature-looking, seeds to which reference
has already been made. Their dimensions are 24 X 2 millims.

Two of these smaller seeds have been found cut in longitudinal section, whilst in
