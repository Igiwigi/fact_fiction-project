When there are two solutions, then the smaller one x; is stable, and the larger one x2 is
unstable. Numerically, it is easy then to see that there is a homoclinic orbit connecting x2 to
itself and surrounding x). The circle x* + y? =1 is composed of two heteroclinic orbits going
from the unstable fixed point on the circle to the stable one. There are also heteroclinic orbits
connecting the unstable fixed point on the circle to xz and x2 to the stable fixed point on the circle.
If there is only one fixed solution then the previous picture simplifies, and, in addition to the
two heteroclinic orbits on the unit circle, there are only heteroclinic orbits connecting the unstable
fixed point on the circle to x; = x2, and connecting the latter to the stable fixed point on the circle.
If there is no solution inside, then all orbits connect the unstable fixed point on the circle to the
stable one. If |A/25| = 1 then there are no orbits connecting the circle with the interior of the disc.

In view of the fact that |1| = |w| (see (5.11)), the upshot is that in all the cases obeying (7.4),
when the unit circle attracts trajectories, it follows that lim sup,_, ,, || =1 where w is related to
(5.1) by (5.6). Consequently, there is unbounded growth of the inner ellipse. Indeed, from the
conservation of Aj and from (5.7) it follows that lim sup,_, ., |Wi| = 09, and that means, in view of
(3.3), that the sum of lengths of semi-axes of the inner ellipse diverges. a
