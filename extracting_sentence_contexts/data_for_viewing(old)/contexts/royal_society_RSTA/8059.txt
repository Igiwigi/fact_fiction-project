The principal feature of our new equations consists in the fact that they represent the
absorption curves as being symmetrical on a scale of wave-lengths. The equations of
Kun and Braun, on the other hand, postulate a symmetrical distribution of frequencies,
whilst the equation of Bretecki and Henrt is of an intermediate type. Our adoption

of the hypothesis of a symmetrical distribution of wave-lengths was based exclusively
on experiment, since the curves reproduced in figs. 2 to 10 are clearly of this type.
