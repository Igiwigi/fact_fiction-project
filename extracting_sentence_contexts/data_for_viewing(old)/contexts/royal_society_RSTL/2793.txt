organs of the influence of the nervous system. That the maintenance of
animal temperature is a function of the nervous system, properly s0 called,
appears from a variety of facts generally known, the temperature either of a
part or of the whole body being lessened by any cause that impairs the action
of particular neryes in the former instance, or of the whole nervous system in
the latter. The question then is, is the nervous system capable of all these
functions after the sensorial power is withdrawn?

At the moment of what we call death, the seneorial functions cease, the
animal no longer feels or wills. Whether the nervous functions properly Â£0
called still continue, can only be determined by experiment. That the nerves
when stimulated are till capable of exciting the muscles of yoluntary motion
is a fact generally admitted ; and that they are still capable of exciting the
action of the muscles of involuntary motion, appears from many experiments
related in the second paper, which I had the honour to present to the Society,
and which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1815. That
the neryous system is capable of causing the evolution of caloric, which
supports animal temperature after the sensorial power is withdrawn, appears
