Our tracings consequently give variations in the depth of the
movements of inspiration and expiration, as well as changes in the rhythm. We,
however, also employed on many occasions artificial respiration ; this, especially after
the observations of Herine and Breuer,” is well known to notably affect the respi-
ratory centre in the medulla oblongata. We would propose, therefore, in view of
these facts, to arrange the results as follows :—
