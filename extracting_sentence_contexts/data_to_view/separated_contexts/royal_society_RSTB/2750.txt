This term was introduced by Gorpet,t and defined as follows :—‘In the vascular
Cryptogams, as in the Phanerogams, the spore-producing tissue may be universally
referred as regards its origin to a cell, a cell-row, or a cell-sheet—I designate these
original parent cells of the sporogenous tissue—as the archesporium.” To this he
added (p. 569) “that in all vascular Cryptogams examined an hypodermal archesporium
exists,” thus definitely localising it in a position comparable to that in the Spermaphyta. He remarks, however, later, that he does not lay special stress upon the archesporium
being always a cell-row or cell-sheet, and contemplates it as possible that sometimes
the development may proceed otherwise than by the appearance of an archesporium of
the form described. In the course of these studies I have found this to be the fact: a considerable
number of cases have been observed in which the archesporium is not hypodermal, in
that it is not defined by a single periclinal wall of the parent cells involved. Thus in
Equisetum § after the first periclinal division of the cell which will form the essential
parts of the sporangium, the outer cell contributes by further periclinal division
considerable additions to the sporogenous mass; this is seen occasionally in Zycopodium,||
while it is frequent in Jsoetes,{ and conspicuously so in Ophioglossum,** the case was
left open in Ymesipteristt and Psilotum.t{ The existence of so many exceptions
among Eusporangiate Pteridophytes suggests a reconsideration of the archesporium. What meaning is to be attached to the term, and is it of general application ?
