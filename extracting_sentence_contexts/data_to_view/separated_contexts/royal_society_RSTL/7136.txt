SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALOULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 853

am far from believing that such is the true solution of this apparent anomaly. Such a
80lution, although not absolutely precluded to us, is in the highest degree improbable;
and the facts admit of an obvious and simple explanation on the hypothesis that chloride
of ammonium is decomposed, at the temperature at which its vapour-density is 8upposed
to have been taken, into equal volumes of hydrochloric acid and ammonia, of which very
satisfactory evidence has been given *. (2) Again, the density of the binoxide of nitrogen is 14-989, as determined by experi-
ment. If this be correct, 2 volumes of binoxide of nitrogen are decomposed into 1 volume
of nitrogen and 1 volume of oxygen ; whence, putting Â«2 as the symbol of the
binoxide, a?
