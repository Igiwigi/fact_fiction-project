DR. MARTIN BARRY ON THE CORPUSCLES OF THE BLOOD. 605

fig. 17. be compared with of fig. 18., taken from that author, a further correspond-
ence will be observed. But it is not needful to refer to the observations of others,
since the objects figured by myself were obviously muscular fibres (the future fasciculi)
in the earliest stages of formation. There is therefore, it appears, a direct transition
of blood-discs into the elementary parts of musecle.

35, My observations have not extended farther than the condition yy of fig. 17.—
for they were almost entirely incidental ;—s0 that I am unable to state the mode of
origin of the fibrillze within the cylinder. But certain facts communicated in my
Third Series of Researches in Embryology, may perhaps be applicable here.

36. It was there shown that a nucleus, after passing to the centre of a cell, resolvyes
itself into the foundations of new cells. I would suggest that the nuclens may
thus be the source of that * secondary deposit” described by VaLexnTIN and SCHWANN
as thickening the membrane of the cylinder; and am the more disposed to think this
possible, from the observations of Scuwann on the frequent metamorphosis of cells
into fibres. The existence of the longitudinal fibrillze might perhaps be thus ex-
plained, for Scawanx remarks, that these fibrillz are formed out of the © secondary
deposits.”—This suggestion corresponds to one offered in my last memoir on the
possible mode of origin of spiral fibres and other secondary deposits in vegetable
cells.
