vacuoles.

The nuclei (n.) are spherical or ovoid, variable in position, and have a distinct nucleolus (ncl.)
staining bright red in safranin, and chromatin masses which appear small, scattered and in-
distinct after fixation in Flemming without acetic, but large and well defined after fixation
in Susa.

The epithelium rests on a basement membrane (6.m.) overlying connective tissue (c.t.), which
is devoid of muscle fibres and mucus cells, and which separates adjoining tubules from one
another and from the overlying gonad.

The variable appearance of the free surface of the epithelium suggests that a phase
change occurs. This suggestion is supported by the following facts.

First, several series of sections have been examined in which no phagocytes whatever
are visible in the liver tubules.

Secondly, the extremely infrequent appearance of cilia lining the liver tubules in
fixed material, while in the fresh material examined they were constantly present,
suggests that the cilia may be readily withdrawn.

Thirdly, the free border of the cells is not always thrown out into irregular cyto-
plasmic processes, frequently it is a smooth uniform surface.

Similar phase changes have been described by other authors. Ports (1923) working
