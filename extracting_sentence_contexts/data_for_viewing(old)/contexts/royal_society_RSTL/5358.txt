the egg is most energetic ?

Although it had been constantly found, both by the authorities before cited, and
since by myself, that when the spermatozoon has ceased to move, and is believed
to be dead, no impregnation results from the contact of its motionless body with
the egg; yet there still appeared to remain some doubt as to what this want of
operation is then due; whether it is to be attributed to the organic death and
incipient decomposition of the body, or whether to the loss or suspension of some
power which is characterized by motion, and through which its function is exercised ?

The following experiments, with reference to this question, were commenced before
I was aware of the fact that the spermatozoon penetrates into the envelopes of the
egg; a fact which, when known, seemed further to necessitate the inquiry, as probably
tending to show whether impregnation is merely the result of a union of the 8ub-
stance of the spermatozoon with that of the yelk or its vesicle; or whether it be not
primarily due to the transmission of some dynamic influence, force, or peculiar
vitalizing power from the spermatozoon to the egg at the time of, or previous to any
fusion with it of its material substance.

The first experiments were made by breaking down the bodies of the spermatozoa
mixed with water, and, after filtration, applying the filtered liquid directly to the
egg; the following being the method pursued :â€”

The bottom and sides of a very small glass mortar, and the glass pestle employed
with it were ground together with fine sand and water, for the purpose of slightly
