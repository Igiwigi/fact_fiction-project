Event attribution studies of extreme rainfall events have used a variety of approaches
including the statistical analysis of observational data and the analysis of large ensembles of
climate model simulations. There is no a priori reason to expect different types of intense storms
to respond in the same way to higher temperatures, and studies have so far not separated storm
types. In fact, there is substantial evidence that changes to the most intense storms may be
quite different than changes to more frequent, less intense storms of the same type [122,135,136]. The literature on the effect of climate change on tropical cyclones is rapidly expanding due to
advances in computing and high-resolution climate modelling. Intense tropical cyclones (TC)
are readily identifiable in both the real world and in appropriate high-resolution simulations
[137], placing them relatively high and to the right in figure 3, with attributable increases of
the risk of extreme rainfall found for Hurricane Harvey [43,118].
