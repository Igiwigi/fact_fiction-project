According to the present writer, in the cases of Rana temporaria and Bufo melano-
stictus the transverse processes are directly formed from the dorsal arcualia, and
there are cartilaginous pieces at their free ends. The situation of the transverse
processes is between the supra and the infra vertebral arteries. Although the
cartilaginous pieces at the free ends of the transverse processes resemble ribs, and are
almost certainly homologous with them, there is no suture between them and the
transverse processes (diapophyses). In the case of Bombinator igneus, GorTre (1875)
is right in stating that the diapophysis is formed directly from dorsal arcualia and
in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th vertebre there are ribs articulating with the free ends
of the transverse processes. There is a peculiarity in this case that the Ist arch of
the urostyle has a pair of transverse processes. RipEwoop (1896) is mistaken when
he says that in Xenopus the 2nd, 3rd and 4th vertebree have no diapophyses. As
a matter of fact, there are small diapophyses quite distinct from the ribs, and
even the suture for the articulation could be easily detected. Ripewoop could
not detect this simply because he did not cut sections but only had whole mounts
of the larval stages, and he himself has admitted that his enquiry makes no pretence
to completeness.

Tn our paper on Urodela (1930) we stated that in this group the rib is formed as an
aggregation of cells in the septum dividing two myotomes, and subsequently grows
inwards, and joins a rib-bearer (diapophysis) developed from the side of the neural
arches. In Anura it is obvious that the same thing occurs, but owing to the narrowness
of the dorsal portions of the myotomes, the lower portions of which fuse to form the
oblique muscles of the abdomen, the mesenchymatous rib is from the beginning formed
close to the distal end of the rib-bearer, and this is especially marked in the case in
