Although electric tests therefore give evidence of the presence of electricity, we
cannot by their means prove its absence; a fact with which we should not have been
acquainted, were it not, under certain circumstances, possible to prove the presence
of electricity without their aid ; that is, the presence of electricity may under certain
circumstances be proved, where it is not indicated by any of the properties generally
admitted to be peculiar to it.

Suppose it were said, for example, that we cannot admit that electricity is the agent
in the combination of oxygen and carbon, because there is no test by which its pre-
sence can be detected ; the reply of Dr. Faravay, I conceive, would be; we cannot
at present, whatever we may do hereafter, make the electricity employed in effecting
this combination evident to any of our tests ; but I consider its presence as a necessary
inference, because I have adduced facts which prove, either that electricity is the
agent in such combinations, or that nature here deviates from the simplicity observed
in all her other works. Either electricity is the agent in the combination in question,
or there are two kinds of chemical affinity.

Under such circumstances can any other reply avail except either disproving the
facts or pointing out the fallacy of the inference ?

What I have done is strikingly illustrated by the late investigations of Dr. Farapay.
It is more than twenty years since I found that voltaic electricity is capable of all the
functions of the nervous influence; it now appears from the facts, on which he has
founded his doctrine of electro-chemical equivalents, that electricity is the agent in all
chemical processes*. According to the inferences of Dr. Faravar therefore, the ex-
