It was ascertained that the image
remained at zero whether both quadrants were charged equally or both discharged. The potential of the 48 elements was measured by 6 elements at a time ; the extremes

were 432 and 437, and the total 3475 scale-divisions. Where the charge of cach

$f quadrant is considerable and of the same sign, it cannot be as8umed that the deflection

for a given difference is the same as if the charges were small, or of equal and opposite

Sign ; in fact, if the potentials of the quadrant and the jar of the electrometer are of

the same sign, the sensibility of the instrument will be diminished (vide Maxwell's -
* Blectricity and Magnetism,‚Äù vol. i. p. 273). On this account the results for 4(7) given

below should be increased by about Fs part of their value. The experiment consisted

in insulating the flask from the battery, and observing the difference of potential between

the flask and the battery after a suitable interval.
