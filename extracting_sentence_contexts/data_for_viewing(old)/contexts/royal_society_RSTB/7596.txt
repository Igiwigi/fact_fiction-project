from severe physiological derangements typified by low levels of blood-sugar and liver

542 D. CHITTY ON MORTALITY AMONG VOLES

reasons for believing that shock disease may be a direct result of stress among crowded
populations. However, the decrease for 3 to 5 years after peak numbers had been passed
cannot be explained by the amount of overcrowding during the period of maximum
juvenile mortality. It seems more likely that, as in the vole, the descendants of crowded
animals were suffering from physiological derangements derived in utero from their parents.
A progressive reduction in viability in each of the generations born during and after the
period of peak numbers fits the observed facts well. On this assumption an acceleration
in the total juvenile death-rate is an inevitable result of the dying out of the older, least
affected breeders.

If it is true that intraspecific competition alone can account for periodic decrease in
snowshoe hares we next have to explain why other species have a cycle of similar length,
roughly in phase with that in the snowshoe hare. It will be sufficient to suggest the
difficulty of explaining this by considering the cycle in ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus).
There seem to be three ways in which synchronous cycles in hares and ruffed grouse might
be explained. Both might be caused by some common factor; one might be dependent on
the other; or the two cycles might be caused independently but be synchronized by
weather. The hypothesis of some common cause of decrease is ruled out if it is true that
intraspecific competition explains the cycle in the hare. It is, in any case, difficult to
