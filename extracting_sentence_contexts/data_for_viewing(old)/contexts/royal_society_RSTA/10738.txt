The numerical values of each of these three terms of the above equation* for air at
temperatures between 100 and 1000 and pressures between 10 and 160 atmospheres
will be found in Table VIL, and the values of the emissivity for the other gases
studied are recorded in Tables VIII. to XI.

If we consider the temperature constant, we obtain for the variation of emissivity

with pressure :t
E = ap* + bpâ€™,

and we have seen that the exponents of p are different for every gas studied. It is
not easy to reconcile this fact with the theory that conductivity, viscosity, and
specific heat are all three independent of pressure. It must be remembered,
however, that the theory is deduced on the assumptions that the molecular paths
are straight lines, that the radius of the molecular sphere of action is very small
compared with the mean free path, and that the cohesion of the gas is a negligible
quantity.

Neither of these hypotheses seems altogether justifiable at pressures of one or two
hundred atmospheres.

* The numerical value of the heat lost by conductivity is merely given to show that, as far as our
present knowledge goes, it forms a very small proportion of the total loss observed at high pressures.
Though the conductivity of gases at ordinary pressures is fairly accurately known its temperature
