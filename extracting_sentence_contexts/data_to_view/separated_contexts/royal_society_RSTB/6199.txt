Some other explanation of this condition is therefore required. All are agreed that
the complex-differences in Oenothera are determined by the middle portions of the
chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the phenotype
normally remain constant from generation to generation shows that crossing-over
does not normally occur in this region of the chromosomes. Obviously, therefore,
true chiasmata do not occur in this region of the chromosomes, except as occasional
occurrences leading to a change of catenation and a mutation. From the considerable literature on catenation in Oenothera and its important
genetical results, only two papers need be cited here, CLELAND and BLAKESLEE
(1931) and Gares and Carcuestpe (1932).
