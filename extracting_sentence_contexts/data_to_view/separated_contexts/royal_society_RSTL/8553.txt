B) is 34 inches long, measured
from the intermaxillary to the occipital condyle, and 247 inches broad in its widest
part, viz. between the zygomatic arches. In general appearance it has a great regem-
blance to the skulls of young examples of the larger species ; yet nearly all the sutures
have disappeared, 80 that the example is evidently a fully adult individual. It is thus
another instance of a well-known fact, viz. that often small species retain through life
the juvenile characters of their larger and more fully developed congeners. The skull
is conspicuously more similar to that of 7. ephippium than to those of the first two
species, as will be scen from the following notes :â€”1. The frontal region is flat, yery
broad, passing into the very short snout, its greatest width (in front of the postfrontals)
being rather more than one half of the distance between the tympanic condyles. 2.
