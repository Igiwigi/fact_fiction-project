42. Tristix liasina (Berthelin), plate 4, figure 56a, b.
1879 Rhabdogonium liasinum Berthelin, p. 35, plate 1, figures 18, 19.

Material: One specimen; Brit. Mus. P34835.

Dimensions: Length 0-17 mm.; greatest width 0-09 mm.

Horizon: 123d—m.

Remarks: The wall is hyaline, the test composed of a linear series of six chambers
increasing regularly in size; in section it is triangular; the margins are not keeled but
are fairly acute in the early chambers, more rounded in the latest; the sides of the test
are only very slightly concave, in fact nearly plane; the aperture is central and
terminal, very small, roughly circular, and apparently plain, not radiate; the proto-
conch was unfortunately broken before figuring, but it was, it is believed, ovoid.

Berthelin’s figure shows a specimen with eleven chambers, which appear to be
shorter than those of the present specimen; but the general shape of the test, seen from
the side as well as from above, and the shape of the individual chambers, show that the
present specimen is practically identical, though with fewer chambers. I have found
no later record of this species, and have no other specimens of it. Berthelin’s figured
specimen was about 0-19 mm. in length.

Rhabdogonium excavatum Reuss (1862, $.B. Akad. Wiss. Wien, 46, Abt. 1, p. 91, plate 12,
figure 8a—c), described from the Gault of Germany, is of somewhat similar appearance,
