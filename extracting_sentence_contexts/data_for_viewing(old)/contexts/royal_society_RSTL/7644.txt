there are experimental grounds for believing to be one of constant occurrence. It has
been observyed that during the ripening of oily seeds the starch disappears as the oil is
formed. This change can scarcely be explained without assuming the snbtraction of
carbonic acid as in the decomposition by which alcohol, glycerine, and fatty acids are
derived from sugar in vinous fermentation. The direct conversion of sugar into wax,
with the evolution of carbonic acid, is known to occur by the agency of bees.

Sacus has shown that some 8eeds which contain no tannin develope that substance
during the first growth after germination, with a simultaneous disappearance of starch.
The period at which it occurs would preclude the direct formation of tannin from
external sources. 'The tannins contain a less percentage of oxygen than the class of
carbohydrates; and their derivation from the latter, attended by the separation of car-
bonie acid, is an hypothesis s8upported by the facts of the case. Without assuming
unusual or improbable decompoxsitions, it is scarcely possible to explain such conversions,
unless this separation be assumed.

The $tate in which the oxygen absorbed by the plant remains, until it is finally excreted
in combination with carbon, is a point of great interest. In order to ascertain whether
it might not possibly be occluded by the tissues, an experiment was performed. A con-
8iderable quantity of willow bark was placed in a flask connected with a Sprengel pump,
and 80 arranged that it could be exhausted while heated in an oil-bath. At temperatures
