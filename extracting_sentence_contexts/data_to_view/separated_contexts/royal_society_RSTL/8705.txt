the cells of these rudiments appear rounded,

S and each of them contains a large nucleus. A I have been unable to prepare longitudinal sections of this stage, either horizontal or
vertical, to show satisfactorily the extreme summit. of the spinal cord; but I would
call attention to the fact that the cells forming the proximal portion of the outgrowth
are 8een in every transverse section at, this stage, and therefore exist the whole way
along, whereas the distat portion is seen only in every third or fourth section, according
to the thickness of the sections. Tt may be concluded from this that there appears a con-
