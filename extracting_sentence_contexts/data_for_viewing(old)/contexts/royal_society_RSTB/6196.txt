the actual thickness.

Agnostus levigatus Horizon (?).—The limit is believed to be seen at loc. 10 where the
unsatisfactory fauna detailed on p. 384 was collected from fine, soft shales intercalated
with coarse grits, tentatively referred to the Agnostus levigatus Zone.

At Comley the beds that appear from their position to represent the P. forchhammeri
Grit of Rushton were seen to be about 6 feet thick, and to graduate with apparent
conformity into soft shale, which, at about 18 feet higher, contained Orusia. Whatever
the actual thickness of the glauconitic quartz grits of Rushton may be, it is almost
certain that they are much thicker than their equivalents at Comley.

Such are the facts, so far as they have been observed, their meaning remains obscure,
but considering that the Upper Cambrian is in Shropshire essentially a deposit of soft

fine shale, the discrepancy above noted may find an explanation in the changing con-
ditions of land and sea which were responsible for the advent of shale without grits.
