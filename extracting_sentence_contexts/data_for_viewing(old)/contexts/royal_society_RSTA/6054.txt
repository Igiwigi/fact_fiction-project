which are a practical way of realizing the decomposition (2.17) at the amplitude level. These
velocity cuts provide a natural way to organize amplitude calculations [67].

By construction, the scattering angle is reproduced in perturbation theory. The completeness
relation implies that the two-body scattering contains the multi-graviton exchanges. Therefore,
the result is not limited to what is known as the potential region of the multi-loop amplitudes
[23,54,55] but includes also radiation reaction pieces [28,29,48,49,56].

(c)_ The classical effective potential from a Lippmann—Schwinger approach

It is a classical problem in perturbation scattering theory to relate the scattering amplitude M
to an interaction potential V. This is typically phrased in terms of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, but it is readily generalized to the relativistic case. Crucial in this respect is the fact
that we shall consider particle solutions to the relativistic equations only. There will thus be,
in the language of old-fashioned (time-ordered) perturbation theory, no back-tracking diagrams
corresponding to multi-particle intermediate states. This is trivially so since we neither wish to
treat the macroscopic classical objects such as heavy neutron stars as indistinguishable particles
with their corresponding antiparticles nor do we wish to probe the scattering process in any
potential annihilation channel. The classical objects that scatter will always be restricted to
classical distance scales.

In the Lippman-Schwinger [68] approach, the classical piece in the quantum scattering
amplitude M and the V are recursively related by
