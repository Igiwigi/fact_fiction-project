The widely accepted story about spliceoso-
mal intron origins derives them from group II introns by the
fragmentation of these potentially self-splicing mobile elements
into ‘five easy pieces’ [66]—the canonical snRNAs—and the


stepwise acquisition of as many as 200 proteins, so many that their interaction, and possible that the process was not complete | 8 |
