sight to have no similar examples in chemistry; and may not
gain immediate assent from every person. The philosopher,
indeed, will feel no humiliation in being forced to correct or to
extend his knowledge: and will not altogether disbelieve a fact,
because he can adduce no parallel instance, or because it is not
in unison with his received opinions. Such conduct would be
raising an insurmountable barrier against the progress of science:
it would be setting up our own feelings in the place of nature;
and attempting to measure what in itself is immeasurable, by
the narrow scale of human comprehension.

But let us not confine our view of the facts and principles
that have been mentioned, to this single instance. Let us trace
them in a more extended circle; and see whether any thing
may be found in nature that can apply to the present subject.
