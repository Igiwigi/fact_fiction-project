Distortions of the Widmanstatten structure in meteorites have previously been noted
by many observers. Among the suggestions made as to their probable origin the effect
of impact with the earth has been put forward. The occurrence of Neumann bands in
the kamacite is generally regarded as a result of such impact, but the fact that Neumann
bands are extremely well developed in Cafion Diablo while slip planes are almost, if
not entirely, absent seems to prove that plastic deformation did not then occur. There are fairly strong grounds for believing that meteorites have originated inside
some heavenly body of planetary dimensions and distortion may have taken place
through the action of internal forces. The slip planes produced might then have healed
by prolonged annealing before the body became disrupted into meteorites.
