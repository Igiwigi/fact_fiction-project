In all cases the calculated
length is roughly equivalent to the visible length of the chromosome at strepsitene. II. From these facts it is postulated that the molecular structure of the chromosome
must in some way resemble that of other highly elastic fibres, notably the proteins
keratin and myosin. The observed changes of length are commensurate with those
produced in keratin and myosin by changes in molecular shape from the Â« to the # and
subsequently to the supercontracted state. On this view the temporary straightening
of a molecular convolution is postulated as a possible causal factor in chromosome
pairing.
