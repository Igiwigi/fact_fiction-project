Specifically, we find a small positive anomaly in the
emissions in April, which coincided with positive temperature and soil moisture anomalies, and

a negative emission anomaly in Septemberâ€”October, which coincided with a negative anomaly in : =
soil moisture. By contrast, we did not find any anomaly for the months May to August, most likely : =
because the elevated temperature and low soil moisture had compensating effects on the CH4 13
emissions from biogenic sources, and we found no change in the annual emission with respect : =
to the mean for 2005 to 2017. Although other regions of Western and Central Europe experienced 8
similar meteorological extremes, changes in CH4 emissions were not apparent possibly owing : 3
to the fact that the per area fluxes, and, in particular, the mineral soil and lake emissions, 19
were generally much lower than in the Netherlands. We also found significant anomalies for : Ss
Serbia, with positive CH4 emission anomalies for the spring, summer and late autumn. Serbia : S
experienced a warmer spring than usual, but in contrast with north of the Alps, the summer 7S

was wetter than usual.
