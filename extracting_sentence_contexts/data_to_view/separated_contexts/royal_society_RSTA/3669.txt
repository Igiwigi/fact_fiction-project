This feature is
explored as connected to pattern formation. It is shown that its magnitude can change the sign
of the lower-order derivatives in the differential equations of motion, so that its effect on the
emergence of deformation patterns is very complex and sometimes counterintuitive. In fact, as
related to the presence of microinertia, the formation of a folding wave propagating along the
discontinuity lines is shown to become possible.

2. Dynamics of couple-stress elasticity

In this section, the basic elastodynamic equations are introduced for linear anisotropic couple-
stress solids. A detailed presentation of the couple-stress theory (called also ‘constrained Cosserat
theory’) can be found in [7] (see also [4,8]).
