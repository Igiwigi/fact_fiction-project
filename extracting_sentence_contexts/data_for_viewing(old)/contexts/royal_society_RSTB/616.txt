two sides. The plantar surface of the foot of the paralyzed side was always dry, some-
what swollen, darker, and hotter to the hand than the opposite foot. The surface
thermometer registered, when applied for the same periods of time, some 5° F’. more on
the paralyzed foot than on the other. When the vaso-motor paralysis passed off, the
plantar surface on the side of the injury became cooler to the feel, and registered
several degrees less than the other side.

In the popliteal space the temperature depends upon thermogenesis in the muscles,
and the skin being covered with hair, little thermolysis takes place there. Conse-
quently, the vaso-motor paralysis does not make itself felt owing to the comparatively
trifling quantity of blood flowing to the skin of this part. The paralysis of the
muscles causes a deficient thermogenesis, and it is this which causes the fall of tem-
perature, as proved by the fact that, with return of movement, there is a rise of
temperature to the normal.

The plantar surface of the foot, however, is supplied with sweat glands and a
large supply of cutaneous blood-vessels. ‘I'he hemisection of the cord paralyzes
the vaso-motor nerves and the sweat glands, causing increase of blood to the part
and deficient elimination of heat by cutaneous evaporation of sweat, hence an
increased surface temperature. After the vaso-motor paralysis has passed off there is
a fall of the surface temperature. A smaller quantity of blood flows to the part
because there is a diminished metabolism occurring in structures functionally inactive
(the foot muscles regain very little power).

The results of cortical stimulation of the brain after hemisection may be summed up
