extends.

Thus © the tides meet,” in reality, along the whole coast, from the Isle of Wight to
the Downs, and perhaps to the coast of Suffolk ; that is, along the whole of this tract
the water is affected by the tide-waves which arrive in the two opposite directions.

It may appear strange that the influence of the eastern tide should cease suddenly
when it reaches the Isle of Wight, not extending any further to the west. If, how-
ever, we look at the map, and obserye the sudden widening'of the channel to the west
of Cape La Hogue, we $hall be at no loss to conceive that the tide-waye may be ex-
tremely diminished by this rapid diffusion, as we know that the tides are greatly in-
creased by the gradual contraction of their beds in estuaries and rivers. But whether
or not this be the cause, the fact is indisputable in the observations, that to the east
of this point the tide-hour changes very little, while to the west it diminishes with
comparative rapidity.

If it were at all doubtful that this difference arises from the interference of the
eastern tide as far as this point, the question would, I conceive, be settled by the two
following articles.

9. The heights, as well as the times of high water, were observed; these heights I
have hitherto examined for a particular purpose only, namely, to ascertain the ex-
istence of a diurnal difference of height, which follows from the theory, as I have ob-
served in a former paper*. From this examination it appears that this diurnal dif-
ference manifests itself with remarkable constancy along a large portion of the coast
