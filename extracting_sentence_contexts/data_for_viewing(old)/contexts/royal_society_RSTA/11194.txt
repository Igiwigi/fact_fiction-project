As a qualitative expression, however, the theory is applicable to electrolytes of all
kinds, and the development of exact numerical relationships is only hindered by the
difficulty of procuring the necessary experimental data, a difficulty that in many
cases can only be overcome by the discovery of new methods of investigation, The
essential postulate of ArrHeNius’ theory is that a salt may exist both in an active
and in an inactive form as regards conductive power, so that when brought into an
electrical circuit, only part of the total weight of electrolyte is as a rule directly
operative in carrying the current. This conception finds expression in the co-efficient
of ionisation, «, which represents the proportion of the salt which is thus active in
electrolytic conduction. Independently of any particular theory as to the exact
nature of the difference between the ionised and un-ionised part of the salt, the
formula « = ina(u-+-v) is universally applicable as expressing the fact that the
specific conductivity « of any binary compound is dependent on the mass m of the
compound contained in unit volume, the proportion @ that is able to take part in the
transport of the current, and the velocities u and v with which the oppositely charged
ions move through the solution under the action of the electrical forces. In the case
of dilute aqueous solutions the numerical values of «, u, and v are accurately known.
In the case of less dilute solutions they are approximately known. In the case of
concentrated solutions and in the case of fused salts they are altogether unknown.

The present paper is essentially a contribution to the study of concentrated
aqueous solutions. We hope at some future date to extend the investigation to
dilute solutions, but the experiments now described deal almost exclusively with
solutions of normal concentration and above. The electrolyte chosen for investigation
