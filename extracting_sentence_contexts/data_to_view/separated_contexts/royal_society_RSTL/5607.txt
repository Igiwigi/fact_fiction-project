They indi-
cate the connexion between the coefficients of the quintic and the constituents of its roots. Those consti-
tuents, by LacnaxGz's process, are expressed as rational functions of the roots, It is to be obseryed that
Evizr's functions arc cyclical. In fact, applying 2' to the cycle

the relations may be written thus :—
