(b) the techniques being used in the exploitation of the second law; (c) the connections with the
microscopic level of description; (d) the range of systems being analysed. In fact, the bibliography
related to extended thermodynamics is considerably wide: it includes at least 18 monographs
[1-18] and 17 review papers [18-35] but the diversity of approaches makes it difficult to give
them a wide well-recognizable form beyond their mutual differences. The aim of this paper is to
foster the contact between them.

Let us note that the central role given to the fluxes in extended thermodynamics, in contrast
to local-equilibrium versions of non-equilibrium thermodynamics (in which the fluxes are
determined by the gradients of the thermodynamic conjugates of the classical equilibrium
variables) fits especially well to the spirit of our globalization epoch. Indeed, the fluxes are
nowadays central concepts of our society: fluxes of capital, of matter (fuel, goods), of information
and of people (migrations, tourism). In fact, they have become some of the critical parameters
for the stability of our model of civilization. Thus, the application of ideas from physics to social
sciences [36] is expected to find in extended thermodynamics a possible source of inspiration for
the treatment of those fluxes.

We will conceptually examine, with a minimum number of equations, three main aspects:
(1) transport equations, corresponding to the evolution equations for the fluxes and providing
non-local and nonlinear transport equations with relaxation effects, applicable for instance to
nanosystems, to fast processes or to slowly relaxing systems; (2) non-equilibrium equations of
state for temperature, pressure and chemical potential, obtained as derivatives of a generalized
entropy, incorporating a non-equilibrium contribution due to the presence of the corresponding
fluxes; and (3) fluctuations around non-equilibrium steady states, with their second moments
obtained from a generalized free-energy, leading to flux-fluctuation expressions yielding an
