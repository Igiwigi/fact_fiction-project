means of the greater quantity of air which necessarily enters its enlarging respiratory
organs. These opinions are 8upported by the facts that some insects pass into the
pupa state at two different periods of the year, and that their 8ubsequent development
into the perfect state depends upon the period at which they enter into the pupa.
Thus the common Cabbage Butterflies, Papilio brassice, Lixx., and P. Napi, Laxx.,
when changed from larva to pupz in the middle of summer, become perfect insects
within a fortnight; but when the change into the pupa state takes place at the end
of summer, the perfect insects are not developed until the following Spring, unless,
as shown long ago by Reaunus, they are placed in a warm atmosphere, when they
may at any time be deyeloped within @ few days, eyen in the months of December
and January. Besides these facts, and a variety of others which are equally well
known, eyery one is aware that the hybernation of many insects occurs at compara-
tively high degrees of temperature. The facts connected with the presumed plethoric
condition of insects before hybernating are equally referable to those perfect insects
which pass the winter months in hybernacula as to larye which are about to pass
into the pupa tate, since it is found that they always have a much larger accumula-
tion of fat in the autumn than at other scasons of the year. This is the case in the
bodies of Vanessa Atalanta, STEPa., F. To, STEra., I. wrtice, and in the Cabbage But-
terflies just noticed ; and it is well known to the cottager that when the flowers have
mot yielded an abundance of honey in the latter part of the 8ummer, the bees in his
hives will have less chance of existing through the winter than when the production of
honey has been plentiful, This latter cireumstance may, perhaps, be said to arise
from a deficiency in the quantity of honey stored up by the bees, but I have strong
reasons for believing that it arises chiefly from the bees being in a worse bodily con-
dition, and having but a small quantity of nutriment stored up within their own
