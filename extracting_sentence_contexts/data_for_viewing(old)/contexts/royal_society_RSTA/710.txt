amplitude function; there are p + 1 nodes in the radial intensity distribution. Index p has so far
featured little in both experimental and theoretical analyses of vortex beams that seemed to have
concentrated primarily on the cases where p = 0, in which the modes are called doughnut modes.
This has led some to refer to the p index as the forgotten quantum number in optical vortex
beam physics [34]. Similarly, the radial structure has not yet featured much in research on electron
vortex beams [35].



Although much of electron vortex research is inspired by concepts and techniques in optical
vortex beams, due to the equivalence of scalar Maxwell equations in free space and the
Schr√©dinger equation for a free particle [17-20], electron vortex beams are characterized by
a number of different properties [20]. These are attributable to the fact that electrons have
finite mass, carry electric charge and have half-integer intrinsic angular momentum (spin).
Furthermore, there are considerable differences in scale. Electron vortex beams created inside
contemporary electron microscopes have de Broglie wavelengths in the picometre range and
are therefore capable of probing much smaller features than is possible using optical vortex
beams for which the typical wavelength is in the hundreds of nanometres range (visible light).
In X-ray microscopy, the lack of efficient focusing devices also limits the practical resolution of

an emergent X-ray vortex beam to be as useful as an electron vortex beam for the purpose of : 8
resolving atomic structure. In addition, the production of optical vortex beams has benefited from Dos
the availability of highly collimated laser beams. The laser cavity modes naturally give rise to : =
