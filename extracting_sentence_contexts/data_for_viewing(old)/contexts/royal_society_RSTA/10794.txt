and as elsewhere I commonly write © to denote & (¢).
The following are the results :—

Type O or EEC; — €* = Sy, cos td.
0
Type ABor EES; 3 = sy sin tp.

It is clear that we may equally well regard the lower limit in the latter as zero.
Type A, or OOC; each term is of type cos (¢ — 1) ¢ cos por cos (t — 2) 6 + cost d.

_ Hence C= zy cos th.

* This also follows from the fact that the series for P* begins with 2, (v* — 1) in the case of EES,
and with Qagv (v2 — 1) in the case of OES. Thus in the former case there is no term Qa and in the

latter no term Qa,v

‘a

Type B, or OOS ; since we now have cos (¢ — 1) } sin ¢,
S = Ly sin td.
