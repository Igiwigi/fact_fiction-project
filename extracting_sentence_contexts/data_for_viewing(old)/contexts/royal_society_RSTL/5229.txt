of the calx, or fixed matter, on the rays of light,

In order to examine all the metals in like cir-
cumſtances, by reducing them into the ſmalleſt
particles, and depriving them of their ſulphur as far
as was practicable, I expoſed each of them, united
with a proper quantity of the pureſt glaſs, without
any additional mgredient, to the greateſt degree of
fire they are capable of bearing, without having all
colour whatever deſtroyed.

In this ſtate it appears, from a variety of experi-
ments and facts, that they aQually do, without any
exception, exhibit colours in the order of their

denfities, as follows, -
Gold Red.
Palos Orange.
Silver —— —Yellow.

Copper — — Green.
Iron —— — Blue,

GOLD.
