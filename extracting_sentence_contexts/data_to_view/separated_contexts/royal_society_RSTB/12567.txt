Figure 7. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous systems. (a) For each subregion S; (/=1, ..., 4) of the per-
mitted parameter space, the mean and the standard deviation of the asymptotic (i.e. taken at t = 100, as previously seen) quantities introduced in Definition 3.1
are evaluated over a set of 10 representative numerical realizations resulting from randomly chosen o7'-triplets. For the sake of consistency throughout the text,
notation M(a) defines in fact the mean of the quantity a, with a â‚¬ {dmin, 0}. (b) Time needed by the predator to reach a target upon variations in the ratio
between the magnitude of prey behavioural stimuli. Each curve is a natural cubic spline interpolating numerical data which are given as the mean and the standard
deviation over a set of 10 representative simulations resulting from randomly chosen individual initial positions (provided that they fall within the same round area
of diameter equal to 6) and orientations. (Online version in colour.)

In this respect, a confused hunter, being unable to single out It is however useful to remark that the model outcomes
and chase a preferred target, has been shown to constantly relative to predator-prey dynamics have here been obtained
fail in its purpose. Such simulation results are in agreement under the assumption that the hunter has the same physical
with experimental studies [51-53] and have been also cap- characteristics as its targets.
