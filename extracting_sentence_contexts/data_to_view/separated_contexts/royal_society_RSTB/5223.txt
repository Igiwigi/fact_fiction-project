It is of interest to notice that the ventral and ventro-lateral portions of the opistho-
spondylous zone are slightly stronger than the corresponding portions of the prospon-
dylous zone. The dorsal and lateral regions of the pro- and opistho-spondylous rings
show equal strength (fig. 19, ps.z., 08.2.). The dorsal and ventral walls of the vertebral body in sagittal section show equal
longitudinal extension, but their respective thickness is different, the ventral wall being
slightly thicker than the dorsal. ‘This is a consequence of the fact that the dorsal portion
of a vertebral centrum persists in the condition of a primary vertebral body, while
the ventral and ventro-lateral portions, being fused with portions of the caudal and
cranial sclerotomites (respectively dorsal and ventral arcualia), represent those of a typical
secondary vertebral body.*

* The “primary” vertebral body thus consists of the bare centrum, a section of the continuous
perichordal tube ; the secondary vertebral body of this centrum with the fused arcualia added to it.

‘The portions of the perichordal tube remaining between the primary vertebral bodies
after the formation of the latter represent the primary intervertebral body (fig. 19, p.iv.b.). The primary intervertebral bodies coincide with the above-mentioned prominent zones
of the perichordal tube, and thus represent the middle (intrasclerotomic) portions of
the former perichordal rings. ‘The primary intervertebral bodies consist of transversely
disposed cells with faint traces of palishblue intercellular substance. It is evident from the above-described relations of the vertebral rings to the perichordal
tube that each segment of the perichordal tube corresponding to the former perichordal
