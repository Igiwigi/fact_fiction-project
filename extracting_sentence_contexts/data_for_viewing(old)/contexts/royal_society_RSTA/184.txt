from ‘complicated’! Immediately, this suggests that, in other potentially complex
systems, one can advantageously progress by looking for their minimal frustrated
models, rather than including at the outset all aspects of real systems at the
microscopic level.

Many other systems in condensed matter physics are now recognized as having
conceptually related glassy complexity,” but let us now turn to different subjects
with different ‘rules’.

3. Combinatorial optimization—satisfiability

The topic of combinatorial optimization has already been introduced through
the Dean’s problem, but in fact there are a very great many hard optimization
problems of considerable interest and intrigue. One such class, much considered in
computer science, is known as ‘satisfiability’. Here, the task is to find the values of
N binary variables 2;; i=1,...,N; x=1,0 such that a set of constraint ‘clauses’
is satished (SAT) e.g.

(a or Zora) and (Z3o0raorz5) and (......) and

(3.1)

where 2; denotes 2; = 1 (or true) and Z; denotes x; = 0 (or false). Here, the sections
between round brackets are the clauses and the number of x alternatives to be
satisfied within a clause is usually denoted K (so in the example shown, K = 3)
