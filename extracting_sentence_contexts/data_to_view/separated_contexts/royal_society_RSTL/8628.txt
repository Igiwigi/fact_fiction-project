The literature of the subject may be disposed of in a very few words ; in the first
Place, there is the view held by Professxor Owex, and concisely expressed by him as
follows :—< In all fishes the first step is the simple production of a soft yascular papilla
from the free surface of the buccal membrane;” and © In many fishes, e. g. Lophius,
£s0x, the dental papille become buried in the membrane from which they rise, and the
Surface to which their basis is attached becomes the bottom of a closed sac;” and again,
* Here, therefore, is represented the *follicular* stage of the development of a mammalian
tooth ; but the © eruptive ' stage takes place without previous inclosure of the follicle and
matrix in the substance of the jawbone.” (Anatomy of Vertebrates, vol. i. P: 382.)

A much more accurate account of the process as it occurs in the mackerel is em-
bodied in Professor Huxrer's paper, already several times alluded to; the fact that the
Papilla is never free and that it is surmounted by an enamel-organ derived from and
continuous with the oral epithelium is clearly laid down ; and KotykeR mentions that
the teeth of all osseous fish are developed. in sacs not altogether from free papille. Nevertheless the exact nature of the process has not, 80 far as I know, been described
by any previous author. In all cases the whole series of changes take place beneath an unbroken surface, and
often at some little depth ; in this respect, however, differences are met with upon
different bones in the mouth of the same fish, s0 that this would appear to be influenced
by accidents of situation.
