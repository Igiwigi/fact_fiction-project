Proof. For the proof, we first note that the first part of Rosenâ€™s argument, namely that fixed Dos
points of Y? are fixed points of R?, holds irrespective of the convexity of C. Moreover, it follows [=
from standard optimization theory [20] that if g1,...,gn, and hence W, are continuous, Yr? hasa 38
closed graph. Hence, by the Eilenberg-Montgomery fixed-point theorem [28], it follows that 7? :
admits a fixed point. Thus, the game {P1,..., PN} admits an equilibrium. a mea)

(b) Uniqueness a

Games can often have multiple Nash equilibria, thereby diminishing the predictive value of aon
the concept. Hence, a sought-after result in the theory of games is the uniqueness of the Nash iS
equilibrium. Classical games (without shared constraints) have unique equilibria under fairly .
mild assumptions. However, in the case of shared constraint games, equilibria are generically
non-unique. In fact, in many cases there is a manifold of equilibria (see examples and a proof
in [21]).

It turns out that the non-uniqueness is primarily limited to generalized Nash equilibria and is
not as common with variational equilibria. In particular, one can show the following by applying
standard results on variational inequalities (e.g. [19]) to VI(C, F).

Theorem 2.7. Suppose the setting of theorem 2.3 holds. Further, assume that the function F is strictly
monotone. Then, the game {P1,...,PN} admits a unique variational equilibrium. If C is closed and convex
(not necessarily bounded), then there is a unique variational equilibrium if F is strongly monotone.

We note here that Rosen [12] employed a closely related concept of diagonal strict concavity to
show his uniqueness result.
