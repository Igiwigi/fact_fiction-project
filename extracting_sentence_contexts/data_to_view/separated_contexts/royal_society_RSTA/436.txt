So what can be learned? Referee A wrote ‘Although the number of people who worry about the value of G is probably
pretty small, discrepancies of these magnitudes are serious business, and it is important to bring
this result to the notice of the standards community. The fact that the value reported here lies
within one sigma of the value reported by Luther ef al. is also interesting, although it might be a
coincidence’. I have known Gabe Luther for many years and during my not infrequent trips to NBS/NIST
in Washington, DC, I always made a point of spending at least half a day in what always turned
out to be useful discussions with him. And given my high respect for Gabe, I would like to think
that the agreement between our two experiments is more than a ‘coincidence’.
