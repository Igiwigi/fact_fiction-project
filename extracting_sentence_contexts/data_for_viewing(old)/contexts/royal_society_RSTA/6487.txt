The second curse has been computing power. It has become nearly trivial to estimate more or
less any mildly identified model that one can write down, and hence there has been an explosion
of terms on the right-hand side. The result is not only thousands of incomparable ‘models’ that
really are bereft of any strong interpretation, but a mistaken vision of science as progressing
by increasing the number of concrete determinants—as if Galileo could be criticized for only
thinking about point masses, and not also including balloons, feathers and magnets when he did
his (fictional) experiments [49]. This has led us to prefer models that seem to possess realism,
but interfere with our capacity to understand more elegant, and more theoretically generative,
simplifications that might speak to the nature of distributions.


Consider the theoretical clarification that came after Quetelet’s development of the statistics
for social phenomena. He was struck by the fact that a predictable mathematical shape arose
in a population. He had made a reasonable stab at explaining the compatibility of this putative
lawfulness and free will, but his ideas could not but give rise to the notion, put forward by his
popularizer Henry Buckle, that, e.g. a certain number of people had to kill themselves, and if one
resisted the dark urges, another would find them all the more pressing. Even Emile Durkheim
was not free from this interpretation.

But Wilhelm Lexis pointed out that this was a fundamental misinterpretation of the nature of
the distribution. If there was actually a non-independence such that the individuals could not be
seen as completely free, it would appear in the form of under-dispersion (a tighter distribution
than generated under the simplest Gaussian process). The very simplicity and elegance of most
of the curves Quetelet studied should reassure us: ‘No one is therefore, for example, required to
hang himself, in order to complete the budget for suicides’ ([50, p. 19]).
