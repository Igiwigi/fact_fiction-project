If,
on the contrary, the bird were reduced to the quantity of respiration appro
priate to the reptile, or the latter to the degree of irritability which obtains in
the former, the functions of life would speedily become extinct. Various de-
viations from the usual proportion between the respiration and the irritability,
however, occur, but there is an immediate tendency to restore that propor-
tion ; increased stimulus exhausts or lowers the degree of irritability, whilst
diminished stimulus allows of its augmentation. The alternations between
activity and sleep afford il]astrations of these facts. Changes in anatomical form in the animal kingdom present other illustra-
tions of the law of the inverse proportion of the respiration and irritability. WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE RESPIRATION AND IRRITABILITY.
