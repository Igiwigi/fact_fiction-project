Being a bodily self requires distinctive biological
features inanimate objects are patently devoid of. That said,
it should be added that it is just because of neural reuse
and ES that the space around us and the objects populating
it are constituted as the horizon of our motor potentialities. As aptly put by Merleau-Ponty, our body ‘provides us with
a way of access to the world and the object, with a praktog-
nosia, which has to be recognized as original and perhaps
as primary’ ([97], p.140)

A similar argument can be used to address the apparent
contradiction between the proposed centrality of action in gen-
erating the bodily self by means of ES and the fact that ES also
applies to emotions and sensations. Centrality does not actu-
ally mean sufficiency. I would rather propose that action is
necessary but not sufficient to generate a full-blown bodily
self.
