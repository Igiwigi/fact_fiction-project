causal role of bodily experience. Namely, by making differ-
ent source domains salient, the bodily experience of
speakers can shape metaphorical understandings of
emotional targets. For example, previously performing the
action of drinking, versus the action of searching, changes
whether the same picture of a smiling person is interpreted

as joy versus happiness, presumably because drinking
invites conceptualization as a ‘container’ (full of joy)
whereas searching invites conceptualization of a ‘quest’
(searching for happiness) [81].

In fact, one thing the literature on emotion metaphors
makes abundantly clear is that emotion concepts do not
reduce to a single metaphorical construal [82]. One classic
example for this is ‘love’ which can be understood as a jour-
ney, a flower, a game or a unity [72]. In turn, different
metaphorical framings can impact emotional reactions, as
shown by a study where participants were more distressed
by relationship conflicts when love was metaphorically con-
strued as a ‘unity’ than a ‘journey’ [83]. The variability of
connections between emotion concepts and embodied reac-
tions may help explain the wildly disparate results in the
muddy literature on physical ‘disgust’ and morality
[84-87], including the failure to obtain such effects altogether
