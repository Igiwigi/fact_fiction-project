the results of observation,- as nearly as. our means of deter-
mination authorise us to expect, we are warranted in believing
that the principle of nature” is obtained; as: we-then have, all
the proofs of its being-s0, which men can haye of the ,justness
of their theories: a constant and perfect agreement-with/the
phenomena, as far as can be discovered. ;

The great criterion in the present case-is, whether-on. the
conversion'of a substance into: its/ Several compounds; .and- of
these-into one another, the simple ratios always: obtain which
the principles of the theory require. Amongst the: multitude
of instances which-I could adduce, in--support of such being
the fact, T will,-for the sake of brevity, confine/-myself to a
few-in the substances/ which: have- come under consideration
above, as they will likewise give- the grounds on which some
of the proportions in the table have been assigned, and every
chemist, by a careful repetition of the experiments, may easily
determine for himself to whatattention the-present theory is
entitled.
