The Chikushan locality was again visited in the summer of 1921 by Dr. ANDERssoN,
accompanied by Drs. WauTeR GrancER and Orro Zpansky. On this occasion con-
versation with local quarrymen led to the discovery of a larger and more richly fossili-
ferous deposit a short distance to the north-west of the Choukoutien railway station.
This deposit then became known as Locality 53 of Dr. ANpERsson’s field notes and
subsequently as our Choukoutien Locality 1 (Sinanthropus site).

At the time of its discovery, the deposit of Locality 1 had been partially exposed at
the head of an abandoned quarry on the north side of a small outlying foothill of
Ordovician limestone. ‘To the north of this hill lies the valley of Laoniuko which in
turn on its north is bordered by hills formed of Carboniferous slates and shales (fig. 31).
These geological facts were well known to Dr. AnpERsson, and during his examination
of the talus of loose material fallen into the quarry from the face of the deposit he
was surprised to notice in it some fragments of white quartz, a mineral normally foreign
in that locality. The possible significance of this occurrence immediately suggested
itself to him, and turning to his companions he exclaimed, dramatically, ‘‘ Here is
primitive man, now all we have to do is to find him!”

For some weeks in the summer of 1921, and again for a longer period in 1923,
Dr. Zpansky carried on paleontological excavations of this cave deposit. He
accumulated an extensive collection of fossil material which was subsequently prepared
and studied in Professor Wman’s laboratory in Uppsala. The results of these important
studies have already in large part been published (Zpansky, 1928).
