These beds have been cut through by two faults with a
downthrow to the north. These faults were contemporary with the formation of
the esker, because the coarse gravel which forms the upper sheet of it passes unbroken
across these faults. This fact is fatal, for this esker, to the supraglacial river theory. On the southern side the bedded sands have been denuded, and a coarse torrential
gravel occupies the hollow thus formed, and passes upward into a fine-grained bedded
gravel, which on each side dips away from the crest of the esker. The sands of the
esker core were obviously once much wider, and are the remains of material deposited
in quiet water.
