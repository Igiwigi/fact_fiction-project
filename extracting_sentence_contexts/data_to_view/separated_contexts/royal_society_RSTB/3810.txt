In subsequent stages the irregular
marginal growths become a definite fringe, in which individual marginal cells may
grow out into long papille ; this being particularly well seen in the case of buds 6 mm.
long, in which the integument just protrudes beyond the outer envelope (fig. 2). Hypotheses built on the fact that lateral lobes of the compressed envelopes, both outer
and inner, are indicative of component leaf’ members of a presumably decussate system,
of which the median members have therefore been lost, are wholly speculative and
serve no useful purpose. Nothing can be gained by trying to force all facts into a

much wider view of the possibilities of Welwitschia is gained when decussate con-
struction is entirely eliminated as a non-essential detail. The archesporial cell is indicated at an early date, usually being recognisable from
the first.
