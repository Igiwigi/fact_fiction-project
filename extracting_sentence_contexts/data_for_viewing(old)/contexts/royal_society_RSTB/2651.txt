These are skeletal features. The actual anatomical features of the polyp are in
favour of my view. Fow erâ€™s work has shown very clearly the near affinity which
exists between Pocillopora, Seriatopora, and Madrepora. The whole tendency of
my work has been to show that the thick, peripheral deposit around the calices
of the simple Turbinolide proves the calicoblastic activity of the same region of
the polypal wall which is supported upon ca@nenchyme in these colonial thecate types.
Whether the coenenchyme is porous or compact I regard as a minor feature.
Moreover, in types which are said to have compact cosnenchyme, occasional spaces
are left unfilled at parts of rapid growth, ex. Stylophora.

In spite of a certain attractiveness in the subdivision of the Madreporaria into two
main Orders, Euthecalia and Pseudothecalia, as above arranged, I do not feel that
it is fully justified in the present position of research. The very fact that the
Eupsammide at present include one or two forms which zoologists have shown to
have either no edge-zone, or a very rudimentary one, warns against premature
acceptance of these sub-divisions. The most probable explanation of this is a certain
retrogression in the edge-zone, and correlative increased active development of the
remote neighbourhood of the polypal wall. The point is however not clear.

Again, the Stylinide show in their other skeletal features relationship with the
Oculinide, yet they have a pseudotheca.

Further, both pseudotheca and theca may be totally absent, and yet the coral show
by its septal and basal structures clear points of affinity with genera in which a wall
is developed. It would be thoroughly artificial to gather such types together and
