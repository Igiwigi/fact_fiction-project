Adding up all the species of the dry zone, we find 472 confined to it with
1809 marks, or a rarity of 3°8; those of the wet zone only are 1692 with 6497 marks,
or also a rarity of 3°8. But the species that occur in both zones, 645 with 1505 marks,
are much commoner in both, and show a rarity of 2°3, 7.e. are fairly near to the
level of “Common.” How this result is to be interpreted it is difficult to say ;
whether it is that these species are really specially adapted to both zones, and
have become common in both, or whether it is that they are on the whole the
first arrivals in the country, and that most species can really live in both zones,
or what, we do not at present know; but the facts are very striking. It is also
very noteworthy that in the dry zone there are only 48 endemic species against

743 in the wet, though the species of wide distribution are only in the proportions
of 304 to 648, and the dry zone has twice the area of the wet.

Invalidity of the Theory of Natural Selection,

Now, when one comes to look into all this, it is seen to be a somewhat important
result. One may, so it seems to me, draw from it two or more conclusions, the
