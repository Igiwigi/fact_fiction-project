itself into a steep and finally almost vertical umbilical wall, the inner part of which is
smooth, the outer undulated by large primary ribs which thicken to bullae on the crater
edge of the umbilicus, and there branch into three secondaries and an intercalatory, which
pass evenly across the sides and venter with a gentle forward swing and no interruption.
From about 80 to 100 mm is the stage of maximum whorl thickness, when the form is that
of a Teloceras, Tulites or Cadoceras. ‘Thereafter, as in P. leicharti, the whorl gradually con-
tracts and the umbilical wall becomes more gently inclined, with the result that in normal
side-view the bullae appear to migrate up the whorl sides. (‘This effect is illusory, however,

for the bullae in fact sink gradually nearer to the umbilical seam, but in a different plane.)
The maximum diameter of the nearly complete specimen is 165 mm.

The chief reasons for assigning this species to Pseudotoites rather than Emileza are: (1) the
restriction of primary ribbing to the outer half of the umbilical wall or slope, leaving
a smooth inner band, which is also characteristic of P. leicharti; (2) the nature of the inner
whorls, which are much less depressed than in Emileia and devoid of primary ribs; (3) the
continuance and coarsening of the characteristic ribbing on the modified adult body
chamber, as in P. leicharti, whereas at the corresponding stage in Emileia ribbing becomes
feeble or disappears. In fact, it is only at the middle stages of growth that Pseudotottes and
Emileia are comparable. On the nucleus and on the adult body chamber the styles of
ribbing are strikingly dissimilar (cf., for example, Buckman 1927, vol. vii, pl. dccxliv, and
Greppin 1898, pl. i).
