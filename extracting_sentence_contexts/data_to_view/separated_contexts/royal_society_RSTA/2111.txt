It is of considerable interest, however,
to compare the actual observed gradient of phonometer readings with the theoretical gradient calculated
from the acoustic output of the diaphone, assuming ideal conditions of sound propagation. If |Ã©p| be the

pressure amplitude at a distance r sufficiently great compared to a wave-length, the ratio of flow of energy
across unit area of wave-front is very approximately given by

[aW/af)=l8p[f(2qm). ee

Expressing the fact that the entire flow of energy across a hemisphere of radius 7 is equal to the acoustic
output at the diaphone, we have

2mr* x |&p|?/(2apo) = (acoustic output)... . . . . . . . . . (ib) If d is the phonometer reading in mm., we have from the known constant of the instrument
