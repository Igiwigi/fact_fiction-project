correction can be shown to be additive and to amount to 1°9 parts in 10,000,

(3) A correction to represent the deviation of the ice-point and fundamental
interval of the mercury thermometer to which the temperatures of the reservoir were
referred from their proper values. The reading of the thermometer at 0° C. was
0:00° C., and the correction to be applied to the fundamental interval was —0:03° C,
The correction to be applied at 17° C. is consequently quite negligible.

(4) A correction for the reduction of the readings of the above mercury ther-
mometer to the absolute scale. The correction is subtractive, and amounts to 2°2 parts
in 10,000 on the specific heat.

(5) A correction for the fact that the volume of the reservoir was altered by the
external pressure of the water in the bath which surrounded it. The corrections for
internal pressure were taken into account when working out the results for the
calibration of the tubes, but the above correction was left to be applied to the
calculated value of the specific heat. It is dealt with fully in the records preserved
in the archives, and is shown to be additive and to amount to 2 parts in 10,000.

Hence the several corrections amount to total additive corrections of 1:5 parts per
1000 on the value of the specific heat at 20° C., and 2°9 parts per 1000 on the value
at 100° C. The corrected values of the specific heat are

S = 024173 cal. per gr. degree at 20° C., S = 0°24801 cal. per gr. degree at* 100° C.,
