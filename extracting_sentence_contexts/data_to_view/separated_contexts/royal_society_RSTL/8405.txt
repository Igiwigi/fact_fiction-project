OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES, 53

Burntisland stems are examples either of the genus Asferophyllites or of Sphenophyllum. The absence of leaves in these Scotch specimens renders it impossible at present to deter-
mine with which of these two genera they ought to be associated, Before attempting
to ascertain the bearing of these facts upon the question of the systematic position of the
plants, we must examine some other organs which, I am now satisfied, belonged to
similar plants. The first inquiry which snggests itself is, What are the relations snbsisting be-
tween the stems described in these pages and the numerous fruits that have been
