where 6 is a constant that does not depend on the final time ty but typically (though not always
[7,8]) depends on the minimum eigenvalue gap A of H(s) between P(s)H and Q(s)H, where Q=
I — P. Since the right-hand side (r.h.s.) represents the deviation from adiabaticity, henceforth we
refer to b as the ‘diabatic evolution bound’ and to @ as the ‘adiabatic timescale’. The total evolution
time is adiabatic if it satisfies tr > 0. Thus, the system evolves adiabatically (diabatically) if the
diabatic evolution bound is small (large).

This version of the adiabatic theorem amounts to finding an expression for Uaq that contains
information about the dynamic and geometric phase acquired along the evolution, and can be
found in the book [8] for unbounded operators. Note that typical textbook expressions (e.g. [9])
just bound the overlap between U,q(1)|¥(0)) and the final state Utot(1)|¥(0)), where |(0)) is the
lowest eigenstate of H(0). Instead, we consider any initial state |¥(0)) € P(0)H, not just the ground
state, and also compute the total phase. This is also more flexible in that, in fact, the projector P
can single out any subspace of eigenstates of H (not necessarily the lowest), which may or may
not be degenerate.

Techniques exist to improve the bound to ;/ tf for integers k > 1. This is done by requiring the
time-dependent Hamiltonian to have vanishing derivatives up to order k at the initial and final

We use a prime to denote /ds in this work.

2The norm we use in this work is the operator norm |\Al| =sup\,) IA |¥/)II (\I |) | =1), which is unitarily invariant [6]:
||UAV|| = |All for arbitrary A and unitary U and V. Additionally, ||Ajj = |A*|| and ||U|| = 1. Unitarily invariant norms are also
submultiplicative: ||AB|| < ||Al||[B||. For Hermitian operators (At = A), we have ||Al| = supyy, (v|VATA|) = supyyy |(WAlW)| >
