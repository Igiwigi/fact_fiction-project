I believe that these portions
are represented in Polygordius by the nephridia rudiments, which in origin and
growth are directly comparable with the head-kidneys of the Trochophore larva. These organs, in the Polygordius and the Trochophore larvee, are so similar in
growth, step for step, that there can hardly be any doubt that they are homologous
structures. In fact, the head-kidney strands in Pomatoceros so closely agree in
arrangement with the lateral portions of the larval mesoblast of Thalassema, that
Torreyâ€™s (21) fig. 8 might do to illustrate certain stages in the development of
Pomatoceros. It is not unfair, therefore, to hold that the head-kidney strands of
Polygordius similarly represent lateral portions of the ectomesoblast.
