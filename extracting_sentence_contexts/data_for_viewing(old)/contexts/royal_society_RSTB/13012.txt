Foxi4.1 Sox10 MMP28

Figure 3. Comparative analysis of MMP28, Snai2, Sox2, Dmrta1, Foxi4.1 and Sox10 expression by single and double in situ hybridization. (a—h) Xenopus embryos at
stage 15 (lateral view, anterior to right, dorsal to top) after single in situ hybridization for Snai2 (a,a’), Sox2 (c,c’), Dmrtal (e,e’) and MMP28 (g,9’), or double in situ
hybridization for MMP28/Snai2 (b,b’), MMP28/Sox2 (d,q’) and MMP28/Dmrta1 (ff). Summary of the expression domains of these genes (h). Dotted lines represent
expression territories of MMP28 (blue), Snai2 (orange), Sox2 (black, neural plate; green, placodes) and Dmrta1 (red). MMP28 (blue) overlaps with the placodal
domain of Sox2 (green). (i-!) Xenopus embryos at stage 25 (anterior to the right, posterior to the left). Diagram illustrating the plane of section (green line;
