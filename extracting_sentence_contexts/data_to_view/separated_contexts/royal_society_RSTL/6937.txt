$ 1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. Irs the paper I had the honour to lay before the Royal Society in May 1859F, on the
occurrence of Flint Implements in France and in England associated with the remains
of extinct mammalia, I postponed the consideration of the theoretical questions involved,
to allow time for a more complete investigation of the physical phenomena. The facts
I sought on that occasion to establish were,—1, the artificial nature of the Flint- |
implements ; 2, their occurrence in undisturbed ground ; 3, their contemporaneity with
the extinct animals; and 4, their postglacial origin. Subsequent researches by myselff,
and other geologists haye confirmed my views upon these seyeral points. When TI first visited Amiens in 1859, the opinion I formed was that the St. Acheul
gravel-beds were deposited before those of St. Roch, and that the excavation of the

but as the relative positions of these beds are becoming better determined, we shall now be able to drop this
term and introduce others of greater precision.
