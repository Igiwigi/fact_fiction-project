roots are grouped in tufts, which arise at, or immediately above, the nodes, and clos
to the insertion of lateral branches.*

Srur, in his account of the roots of Calamites, mentions one point of considerab
interest.t He finds that the woody cylinder of the root is not always median, but
often laterally displaced, showing that it was freely movable within the outer cortical
envelope. This fact finds its explanation now that we know that the middle corte
of Calamitean roots was traversed by large lacunz, and would thus offer little resist-
ance to the displacement of the central cylinder.

Srur mentions that some of the roots observed by him bear rootlets, while othe
do not. He is disposed to regard the latter as floating roots, the former as havin o
grown in the soil.

A fine specimen of a Calamitean stem, showing clearly the insertion of the roots
exactly on the nodes, has been figured by Renautr.t

From the sources mentioned, as well as from others, we thus have a general idea of
the external characters of the adventitious roots of Calamites, and of their arrange-
