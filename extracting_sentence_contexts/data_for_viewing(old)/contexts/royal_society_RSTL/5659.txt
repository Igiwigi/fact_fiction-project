Point 5, let the line joining the points 3 and 4 meet the curve in a point, 6, then the
line joining 5, 6 meets the curve in the point 7 required. Now when 1 and 2, 3 and 4
coincide, the points 5 and 6 both coincide with the tangential of that point, and con-
8equently 7 is the second tangential.

It follows immediately that the conic through five consecutive points meets the curve
again in a point which is found by joining the original point to its second tangential,
and taking the point where the joining line meets the curve again. We deduce hence

tangential should be a point of inflexion. There are then twenty-seven conics which can
meet a cubic in six consecutive points, and the points of contact are the points of con-
tact of the tangents drawn from the nine points of inflexion.

We return to complete the algebraic soJution of the problem to determine the equa-
