observed at so early a period, indicates an abbreviation of development, some inter-
mediate stage having dropped out.

One of the most interesting points about the development of the somites is the fact
that the so-called double segments have two mesoblastic segments each. As is well

* known, Newport held that each double segment represented two single segments of
an earlier stage in the phylogeny, which had become fused, and retained traces of
their original condition. Later on, Banrour suggested that the double segments
might represent single segments which had developed a second pair of limbs, and had
altered the nerve-system and other organs to suit them. He was followed in this
suggestion by Packarp (14), and later by Grasst (5). It seems to me that this
view is contradicted by the facts just mentioned, inasmuch as the segmentation of
the mesoblast is one of the most primitive processes in the development, and affords
us the best guide to the consideration of the segmentation of the adult.

The presence of two nerve-ganglia to each double segment also favours the belief
that each of the latter represents two perfect segments ; but I should not be inclined
to consider this of itself as sufficiently strong evidence, since the nerve-system
undergoes so much modification, in the course of development, that one might easily
suppose that a stage where one ganglion to each double segment had existed had
dropped out of the development. I cannot, however, suppose this in the case of the
mesoblastic segments. The external skeleton of the animal does not exactly coincide
with the mesoblastic segmentation, and T hold that the surest guide in cousidering
the segmentation of the adult is the early mesoblastic segmentation,
