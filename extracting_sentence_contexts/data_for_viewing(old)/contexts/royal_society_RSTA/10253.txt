when in equilibrium, is common to both our problems. It is in the conditions which
determine secular stability that the problem divides itself into two.

One cause of instability in the system resides in the effect on each body of the
reaction on it of the frictionally resisted tides raised by it in the other. If now the
larger of the two masses were rigid, while still possessing the same shape which it
would have had if formed of liquid, the only effect on the orbital stability of the
system would be due to the friction of the tides of the smaller mass generated by the
attraction of the larger one. Investigation shows that in this case, as the two masses
are brought nearer and nearer together, instability would not supervene from tidal
friction until the two masses were almost in contact; but it is clear that the
deformation of the figure of the liquid mass presents another possible cause of
instability. In fact, instability, as due to the deformation of figure, will set in when
the masses are still at a considerable distance apart. It amounts to exactly the same
whether we consider the larger mass to be rigid, or whether we treat it as liquid and
agree to disregard the instability which arises from the friction of the tides raised in
it by the smaller body. Accordingly we may describe the stability just considered as
“partial,” whilst full secular stability of both bodies will depend on the tidal friction
of the larger mass also.

The determination of the figure and partial stability of a liquid satellite (i.c., apart
from the effects of the tidal friction of the planet) is the problem of Rocuz. He,
however, virtually regarded the planet as constrainedly a sphere, whilst in general I
have treated it as an ellipsoid with the form of equilibrium. ;
