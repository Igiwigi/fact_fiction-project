S has been applied, and while the load remains constant, except to a very insignificant

S extent. The successive steps in the process of loading and unloading may be

j performed at intervals of some hours even without affecting the form of the curves.

& Examining now the on curve, we see that the effect of moderately loading a
8tretched wire is to increase its magnetism, under the conditions we have here, but
that a maximum is passed, and the later stages of the loading diminish the mag-
netism. A similar maximum occurs on the off curve, but owing to the presence of
hysteresis it occurs at a s8maller value of the load than the maximum point in the 07
curve. Each maximum is, in fact, shifted by hysteresis to a later part of the
operation than it would otherwise occupy, and if there were no hysteresis we should
expect it to take a position between the two actual maximums, or ab aboub 8 kilos.

hysteresis, is the comparatively easy gradient at the begiuning of the on curve and
