| In new stars, therefore, it is possible for us to have the radiation spectra of vapours
- corresponding to sparse swarms of meteorites (nebulz, bright-line “ stars,” and comets
: & away from perihelion), and the mixed radiation of carbon, with the fluting absorption of
% metallic vapours, corresponding to bodies of Group II., and to comets nearer perihelion.
= That is to say, we may have the radiation lines of hydrogen and fluting of magnesium
‘= = at_ 500, plus the radiation of carbon and fluting or line absorption of manganese, lead,
= iron, &c., a condition which cannot occur when only a single swarm is in question.

EB The mixed spectroscopic phenomena, which should be seen on the collision of
2 two swarms, were noted in my paper of November, 1887,* as follows :—‘‘ We shall, in
fo}

2 fact, have in one part the conditions represented in Class IIIa., and in the other, such
> a condition as we get in y Cassiopeiz.”

S In the present paper I give detailed discussions of all the Nove which have been
£  spectroscopically examined, and the results fully bear out these views.

& The Relation between Nove and Variables of Group I.

3 If the two swarms which produce a new star by collision are such that the mean
g distance between the meteorites in the resulting “mixed swarm” is about equal to
@ that between the meteorites in a body of Group IL., say « Orionis, mixed radiation
of carbon and metallic fluting absorption will preponderate in the spectrum observed.
At the same time, the sparser portions of the swarms give us hydrogen radiation.
