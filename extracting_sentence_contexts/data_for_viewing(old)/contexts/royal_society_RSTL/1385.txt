one present. v

The order in which the different alloys stand with regard
to this action, is as follows: steel, cromium alloy, silver
alloy, gold alloy, nickel alloy, rhodium alloy, iridium and
osmium alloy, palladium alloy, platina alloy, With similar
acid the action on the pure steel was scarcely perceptible ; the
Silver alloy gave very little gas, nor was the gold much
acted on. All the others gave gas copiously, but the platina
alloy in most abundance.

In connection with the analysis of these alloys, there are
some very interesting facts to be observed during the action
of acids on them, and perhaps none of these are more strik-
ing than those last referred to. When the alloys are im-
mersed in diluted acid, the peculiar properties which some of
them exhibit, not only mark and distinguish them from com-
mon 5teel, and from each. other, but also give rise to some
considerations on the state of particles of matter of different

may lead to clearer and more perfect ideas on this subject.
