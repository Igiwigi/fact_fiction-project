The possibility of the fecundatory function being in some way connected with the
motion exhibited by the contents of the pollen in plants, and with that of the
spermatozoa in animals, has not escaped the consideration of the best observers. Mr. Brown, the most distinguished of botanists, many years ago, made this the

subject of his particular investigation*; and M. Broncntart4F, ScaLEDEN + Naczuy,
Grrerira ||, and more recently SuminsK1 and Henerey ** have done the same,
But although neither of these able inquirers succeeded by direct experiment in
proving that the motion of the particles of plants is essential to the act of impregna-
tion, M. HormersTeRFF, and very recently also Mr. Hexrrey$%, have noticed facts
in regard to that of the spermatozoid filaments discovered by Nice and SuUminss1,
in the Cryptogamia, which seem to show that, in plants, it is of great importance to
the function of these bodies. The motion of the spermatozoon in animals has equally
attracted the attention of zoologists. PrEvosT and Dumas {\, as already stated,
SteBoLD, MULLER, WAGNER, Koriiker, BiscHorr, QUATREFAGES, and especially
WaexeR and LEUckaRDrT, have studied it attentively ; but s0 intricate is the inquiry
concerning its nature and import, that the last two authors dismiss the consideration
of the question without arriving at any conelusion, and state that they do not venture
to decide||||.
