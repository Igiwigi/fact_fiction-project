S the following paragraph, whigh serves to state the present standing of the question as to whether the waves of
= contraction in Aurelia depend for their passage on the muscular elements alone, or likewise upon the nervous
= elements—a question which, it will be observed, is not decided even by the histological demonstration of a

nerve-plexus —

« But in addition to these general considerations we must remember, more particularly, that in Aurelia aurita
we have already obtained evidence of more or less distinet conductile tracts— this evidence being even last year
sufficiently strong to render the plexus theory on the whole the most; probable one that could be devised. This
year that evidence has been further confirmed by explorations by stimuli ; 80 that, the only obstacle in the way
of our accepting the plexus theory to account for the paszage of contractile waves is the enormous amount of
section which the contractile tissues will endure without these waves becoming blocked. Now the only reason
why this fact is an obstacle in the way of our accepting the plexus theory is because, upon that theory, this fact
would require us to suppose the conductile elements to be capable of vicarious action to an almost incredible
extent, Heneo it was that last year the issue with respect to the passage of contractile waves lay between
