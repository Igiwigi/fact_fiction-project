It is noteworthy, however, that among a number of locusts caused to settle by a gust,
those remaining in more exposed, insecure situations took off again sooner than those
secure in better shelter (p. 181). Locusts settled in a strong wind are visibly affected by it.
They can be seen bracing themselves against the buffeting, their antennae raised and
quivering in the wind. Their immediate response is not to fly but to cling tenaciously to
their foothold. But perhaps this stimulation adds to the strength of the pent-up tendency of
the insects to fly, leading to mass taking-off whenever the windâ€™s immediately inhibiting
influence is relaxed in a lull. Further data are required to decide whether taking-off would
occur in this way, as a relief from excessive buffeting.

The optomotor theory of behaviour in wind. While there is no evidence that flying locusts do,
in fact, respond directly to the wind, there is good evidence that other insects make visual
compensatory responses to the apparent movement of the fixed background, a movement
due to their being carried over that background by the wind. The use of fixed visible
features for wind orientation has been suggested for many insects, and demonstrated in the
laboratory for mosquitoes (Kennedy 1940). It would, on the whole, be more surprising if
locusts did not respond indirectly to wind in a similar way than if they did. What positive
evidence is there that they do so react?

Perhaps the best evidence comes from observations of flight over water (pp. 192-193).
