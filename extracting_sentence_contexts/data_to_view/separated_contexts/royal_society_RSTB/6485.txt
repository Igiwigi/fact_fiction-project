When alarmed it will dart rapidly along the
tube as already stated, but usually its movement is a deliberate glide made apparently
without any effort. The posterior part of the body is sometimes apparently exerted
from the tube and when again withdrawn it leaves a prolongation of the smear
behind it. It is in fact always covered with the slime or silk and it looks as if this
were extruded from the posterior part of the body. I believe, however, this is not
the case, but that it comes from the mouth and that the posterior part of the body is
constantly as it were drowned in this sludge. This point is of importance in con-
nexion with the absence of breathing organs in the abdominal region.”

experiences no difficulty in turning itself in the other direction by doubling up.
