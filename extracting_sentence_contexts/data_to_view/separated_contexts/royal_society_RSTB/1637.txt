In the course of this research it became more necessary than ever to learn the
range or amplitude of the modifications of the various elements which enter into the
composition of vertebrae. The extreme variations are not necessarily the exceptions,
more or less abnormal, and therefore to be passed over in silence. On the contrary,
this procedure in the gathering of facts, often revealed as truly normal and important
what had hitherto been considered as insignificant detail. This applies, in the
selection as types, to the individual specimens, and still more forcibly to the larger
groups, as Â¢.g., families from and for which we select the representatives. The frog is the most glaring example.
