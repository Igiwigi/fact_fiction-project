The character
;= of development also was extremely different, On plot 9, with the continuous supply
2 of potass, the grasses showed much tendency to produce stem and seed, and to mature. 5 On plot 10, on the other hand, with the only temporary supply of potass, the propor-
S tion of leaf to stem was very much greater, the herbage was patchy, of a much darker
Ss green colour, and matured unevenly, and imperfectly. There was, in fact, a relative
& plethora of nitrogen, and with the deficiency of potass a deficient assimilation of
G carbon.
b= With these great differences in the character of development apparent to the eye,
Z there were corresponding differences in the chemical composition quite consistent with
= them and their cause. Â£ In the dry substance of the produce grown with the deficient supply of potass there
2 was a considerably higher, and an abnormally high, percentage of nitrogen, and a
= lower percentage of total mineral matter.
