_ That a pro-albumen such as I have described in Monotremata has not been recog-
nised in most Vertebrata is due possibly to the shortness of the period of its formation.

Cunnincuam (67), however, has recently shown that such a structure exists in
Myzxine, but he assumed that it gave rise directly to the shell, and consequently could

not be homologous with the albumen or the shell of Elasmobranchii. It seems more
probable that the difference between the shell of Elasmobranchii and that of My«ine
is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen absorbs fluid in the course
of its passage down the oviduct.

The shell membrane presents another difficulty. I have shown that in Marsupialia
it does not increase at the expense of the albumen.

CuNNINGHAM states that the shell of Mymine arises directly from the pro-albumen,
and others have imagined a similar origin for it in Elasmobranchs and Sauropsida,

Vow Barr compared the albumen of a Frog’s egg to the shell of a Bird’s.

These considerations show that further investigations are necessary in both Ichthyo-
psida and Sauropsida before the three membranes can be traced through Vertebrates.
