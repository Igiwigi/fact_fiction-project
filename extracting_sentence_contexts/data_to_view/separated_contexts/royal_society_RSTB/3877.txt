On the other
hand, Table III gives the correlation between individual ancestors and their individual
offspring. (2) The “number of individuals per family” is the number measured,
not the number produced. (3) The “number of ancestors ” becomes less in
proportion to the number of families of’ offspring (Table II), or number of individual
offspring (Table III), as we rise in the scale of ancestry, owing to the fact, already
mentioned, that when in any generation the individual selected for parentage in the
a or b line failed by death or accident to leave a family, two individuals were chosen
from the surviving line in the next generation. There is, therefore, a slight
convergence of ancestry within a few of the clones. 438 MR.
