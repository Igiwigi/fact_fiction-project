PROFESSOR CAYLEY'S NINTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. 29

344. Again, for the line

there are here 10 composite covyariants, but only 5 irreducible coyariants ; there should
therefore be 10—5, =5 syzygies; we have in fact the 6 derived syzygies
A(AN—BE—6DI+2EH—FG)=0 &e. (ﬆe Table No. 89)

designated by 6E'; these must therefore be connected by 1 identical relation (desig-
nated by o), viz. this is the equation 0=0 obtained by adding the several syzygies,
each multiplied by the proper numerical factor as shown Table No. 89.

345. These two cases (-) are in fact the instances which present themselyes where a
correction is required to my original theory. The two identical relations in question
were disregarded in my original theory, and this accordingly gave the two non-existent.
irreducible covariants (a, ..(a, y)'* and (a, ..Y(v, y)”. And reverting to No. 336, these
give in the denominator of A(z) the factors (1—*a®)(L—d*s"'). In virtue hereof,
es =(1—&), agreeing with the function
(1=y1=9)....(1-&.... Andwe thus see that the denominator factors of A(a)
do not all of them refer to irreducible covariants; viz. we have

ar, ax, on?, Oa?, af, af, a'a?, aa*, of, aa", a*a*, en, aff, afa*, wa?, wn, af? af,
each referring to an irreducible coyariant, but aa and a*z"* each referring to an iden-
tical relation () or interconnexion of syzygies. And we thus understand hoy, consist-
ently with the number of the irreducible covariants being finite, the expression for A(z)
