units (e.g. VII. 15 is the special case for units of VIL. 9). So in
effect Euclid had 1s as well as plural numbers, but there was
no notion of zero.

The classical view of cardinal numbers has staying power. Its
best modern variant, put forward by the mathematical logician
John Mayberry, takes arithmetic and number theory to be gen-
eral truths about sets (including one-membered sets and the
empty set), interpreting numerical equations in terms of 1-1 cor-
relations as is done in standard set theory [2]. For example, ‘3 +
2 = 5’ istaken to mean that there is a 1—1 correlation between the
union of any triple with any pair not overlapping the triple and
any quintet. In fact, the whole of cardinal number theory, includ-
ing theorems about zero, can be interpreted along these lines in
set theory. An attractive feature of the classical view is that the
problem of cognitive access seems to melt away: we can have
access to some numbers by perception (those three eggs) or by
description (Jupiter’s moons).

But there is one major disadvantage. The classical approach
allows that there are many 1s, many 2s and in general many ks,
whereas modern number theory assumes that there is just one
number for each numeral. This can be seen from the use of
number-counting functions, the definitions of which make no
sense unless it is assumed that there is just one number per
