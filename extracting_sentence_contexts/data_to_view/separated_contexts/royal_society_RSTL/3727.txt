The
first result, did follow ; upon taking out the stoppers the morning after the battery had
been charged, the liquid rose in the air-tube one-fifth of the gaseous volume. I now
closed it again and examined it three days afterwards ; a very curious effect had taken
place; the volume of the gas in the air tube which had previously contracted had
now increased, and it continued slowly increasing day after day. I at first believed
that the nitrogen was decomposed, but after many conjectures and experiments found
that the increase was due to the addition of hydrogen, a fact to me more extraor-
dinary than the decomposition of nitrogen would have been. Â© On repeating the ex-
periment with nitrogen instead of air the same effect took place, but of course without
the previous contraction. I 10w returned to battery fig. 4; several of these cells
charged, some with atmospheric air and hydrogen, and others with nitrogen and
hydrogen, did not exhibit the effect, though suffered to remain six weeks, each in
closed circuit. To ascertain whether the vacuum formed by the abstraction of oxygen from the
liquid had anything to do with the above effect, a central narrow tube, open at both
ends, was substituted for the stopper in the battery fig. 8; the hydrogen was still
evolved.
