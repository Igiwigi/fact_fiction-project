in such regions. In other words, the time derivative of the velocity potential is a single-valued
function having a direct hydrodynamical interpretation. The fact that ¢ is globally single-valued
can be seen as a way to express Kelvin’s Law (2.9) for conservation of circulations. By contrast,
the imaginary part of f need not be globally single-valued (but the derivative f/0Z always is). As a further remark, Bernoulli’s equation, stating that the right member of (6.9) is constant in
the case of stationary flow, comes out very nicely: when the flow is stationary, so that ¥ =0, then
f is analytic and real-valued in regions without vorticity, and hence equals a (real) constant there.
