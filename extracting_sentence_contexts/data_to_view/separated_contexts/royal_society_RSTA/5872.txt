bottom of the reactant well, the theory does not neglect the effect of ZPE, which is instead dealt
with in the prefactor terms. In fact, the same thing happens in the Born—-Oppenheimer case, for
which it is possible to prove that the low-temperature limit of instanton theory is asymptotic to
the WKB rate of tunnelling out of the lowest vibrational level [97]. Because of this the instanton
results are in good agreement with the quantum calculations in the deep-tunnelling regime and
correctly recover the classical limit at high temperatures.

4. Fourth-order instanton theory

We consider a system that consists of three potentials corresponding to a reactant |R), bridge |B)
and product |P), arranged as shown in figure 4a.
