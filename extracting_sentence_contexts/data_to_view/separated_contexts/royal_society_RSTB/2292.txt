expansion of this theory leads to a somewhat different conclusion, which may be
expressed as follows :—If the total number of molecules in unit volume of a mixture
of two diffusing gases is represented by N, and the changing number of molecules
of the constituents by N,, N, respectively, then the diffusivity will be found to vary
slightly with the ratio of mixture N,/N,, whereas according to SreraAn and Max-
WELL's views the coefficient of diffusion is independent of this ratio. In the ease of CO, and air Meyer's theory leads to a lower coetticient of diffusion
than ‘142 for the extremely dilute CO, with which we have to deal in ordinary air,
whereas we find a distinctly higher value than this, one in fact which is quite as high
as some of those obtained by the ordinary methods of mixture originally employed
by Loscumipr,

(2) Diffusion of Aqueous Vapour in Air. An attempt was made to determine the value of & for aqueous vapour at low
tensions when diffusing into air, in the following manner :—

Small dishes or cylinders, from 4 to 6 centims. in diameter, were covered with thin
mica dises which were fixed on to them with Canada balsam. The discs were per-
forated with a single central hole of 4 millims. in diameter, water being poured into
the vessels to about 1°5 centims. from the top.
