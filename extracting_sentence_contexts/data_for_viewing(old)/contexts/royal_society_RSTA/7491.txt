Ficure 14, Variation of pressure on stationary disk with speed, displacement and radius of the point.
Range of variables for plotted points: w, 118 to 225 r.p.m.; A, 0-8 to 8-6 mm.; r, 0-8 to 2-0 cm.
The points A are for Â» = 225 r.p.m. and the top one is for a point too near the centre of the disk.

Thus, it appears that the theories described account for the observed facts in several
experiments.


BEHAVIOUR OF ELASTO-VISCOUS SYSTEMS UNDER STRESS 63

F Low In PIPES

On the basis of the theories propounded in the previous sections, the flow of these liquids
in pipes should show certain peculiarities. The first is to be observed at the inlet. As the
liquid converges into the pipe it is moving from regions of low free energy to regions of high
free energy. Therefore the structural units of flow should tend to oppose this flow either
by establishing a secondary back flow or by secondary helicoidal flow. By any mechanism
