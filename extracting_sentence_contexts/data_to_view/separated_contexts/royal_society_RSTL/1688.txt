It has since occtrred to me, as affording a possible explana-
tion of the alteration, that after the comparison in London,
Mr. Jonts took his barometer with him to his house to en-
grave the neutral point, and the diameter of the tube, upon
the brass cover of the cistern, and I remember that he
spoke of one or two screws which required to be tightened,
and which, he observed, might affect the relation of the
cistern and scale. That the alteration should have taken
place at that time and in some such manner ; and that the
mercury which appeared between the cistern and its cover
had lodged there accidentally in the original putting toge-
ther of the instrument, and that it was not therefore con-
cerned in producing the change, would seem the more
probable supposition, than that it should have escaped subse-
quently from the cistern ; since, if a part of the mercury had
found a means of escape, more would have followed either
then or since, which however has not been s0, as no altera-
tion has taken place subsequently in the relative indications
of the two barometers. Having ascertained this last fact on
my arrival at Spitzbergen, in July, a careful series of compa-

*risons was instituted to determine the exact amount of the

alteration since the original comparison at Mr. NEWMAN's,
and to obtain a fresh index correction and neutral point, since
each would be alike affected, whether the cause were 'a



trigonometrical measurements at Spitzbergen. 299

displacement of the scale, or a diminution of mercury in the
cistern. The subjoined comparisons will show that an altera-
tion, amounting to 0.129 parts of an inch, being supposed to
have taken place since the first comparison, making the
index correction of Mr. Jones's + 0.196, and its neutral
point 30,271, will reconcile all the comparisons within such
limits as may readily be allowed as errors of observation.
