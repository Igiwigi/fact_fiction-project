Note that the species labelled as CO, and CO are not corrected for
the effects of cracking of C0, * (m/z 44) to CO* (m/z 28). This has not been done herein because the exact details of corrections
like this are not yet certain and will require further work. However, it is a fact that without correction the values recorded for CO
are upper limits. Error bars are 1 s.d. (i.e. the noise associated with ion counting).

low H2O/CO} ratio is a consequence of low activity—this will be resolved as Rosetta continues
to follow the comet through Perihelion and beyond. As noted previously [34] there is a low
CO/CO; ratio at Abydos; in fact, since the data are not corrected for the effects of cracking of
CO», this means that the values are upper limits since the measured CO? signal is not entirely
from ionized CO (i.e. some is from CO* that is cracked from CO2+ within the mass spectrometer).
