Discussion of Results. Among all the crystals studied by us, manganese ammonium sulphate has the smallest
magnetic anisotropy. ‘The difference between the maximum and the minimum principal
susceptibilities is only 11-4, in a mean susceptibility of 13830,; 7.¢., 0-08 of one per cent,
of the mean value. (Che value of Ay/z calculated from Rast’s absolute measurements
is about 1 per cent.) It is almost of the order of diamagnetic anisotropy. This is
clearly what we should expect from the fact that the ground state of the Mnt* ion is
an S-state.* For the same reason, the crystal may be expected to obey the simple
Curte law. Our mean value for the susceptibility would then correspond to a magnetic
moment for the Mn** ion of 29-0 Wxiss magnetons, as against the value 29-4 calculated
from the spin moments of the five electrons in the outermost shell. The nickel salts are also feebly anisotropic, the values of Ay/y varying from 2 to 4 per
cent. in the different compounds.
