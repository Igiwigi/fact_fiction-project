820 SIR RAY LANKESTER ON THE DISCOVERY OF A NOVEL TYPE OF FLINT



IMPLEMENTS BELOW THE BASE OF THE RED CRAG OF SUFFOLK. 321

Nores To Fias. 27 to 34.—The close general resemblance of form and flaking of the two implements
drawn in these figures is remarkable. e chance of accidental coincidence may be at once put aside,
since the number of fractured flints in the two localities from which these specimens come is not very
large. This is a fact which must always be borne in mind. The chief difference in the manufacture of
the two implements is that in the Ipswich specimen (figs. 27, 29, 31, and 33) the ventral surface (as I
term it) is formed entirely by the natural cortex (fig. 29), except for the removal of one or two “knobs”
at its broader part ; whereas in the Sutton specimen the ventral surface has been formed in the region of
the projecting beak by a single adroit fracture (fig. 30). In the splendid series of chert implements—
most of them of a very primitive character—collected in the Aurillac district (Cantal, Auvergne, France)
by Mr. Epwarp WESTLAKE, of Fordingbridge, which I have lately examined, there is a carefully chipped
one-sided pick which resembles the two implements here figured. It is one of the most obviously human
productions in the collection. In the same collection I noted three implements of the rostro-carinate type
(see postscript and text-figs. 44 and 45).
