(b) A resonance method (used by Ernsrern and pe Haas and others) in which the
angle of twist is increased by repeating the impulse at intervals of time equal
to the period of the suspended cylinder.

(c) A null method (at which we are now working)* in which the twisting effect of
the timed impulses is balanced by a series of equal and opposite impulses of
known value applied simultaneously.

In spite of the fact that Srewarr’s results with the ballistic method varied considerably
among themselves a comparison of @ with b (¢ had not occurred to us when we began
the present work) seemed to show, not only that the sources of error would be more
easily disentangled and allowed for in a than in 6, but that @ might be modified in the
direction of greater accuracy than Srewarrt obtained. We have therefore based the
work recorded in what follows upon the ballistic method.

Apparatus.

As in Stewart's measurements, the specimen to be tested was a piece of thin wire,
in our case straightened by heating to redness under tension. This is shown at S,
fig. 1, suspended vertically along the axis of the magnetising helix, H, by a fine quartz
fibre attached to a torsion head K. K turns in a brass tube K, fixed at its lower end by
