industrial areas bordering urban centres. Some of these industrial areas were renovated and
are being used with different purposes. Although in many cases the buildings have been
progressively demolished, most of the chimneys were kept as sculptures to the memory of the
site’s past industrial history. Once outside ordinary living areas, with the growth of the cities,
these old industrial chimneys, now degraded, are actually part of renovated areas surrounded by
dwellings and service buildings, or placed inside leisure areas, being a threat to the safety of the
surrounding environment.

In fact, this ‘new’ positioning of the industrial chimneys in inhabited areas raises important
questions regarding the safety of persons and properties. It requires the verification of the
chimneys safety conditions, which involves inspection and diagnosis actions, as recommended by
international entities, such as the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) [1].
In this context, it also demands the assessment of the geometrical and material characteristics and
structural conservation state. Note that any intervention to be proposed should result from a duly
evaluated necessity, i.e. a safety evaluation based on effective knowledge of the characteristics and
state of conservation of the chimney [2].

This work presents the results of the survey of the geometric characteristics and the dynamic
identification of the mechanical properties of the materials of 10 brick masonry industrial
chimneys in Portugal. It includes the analysis of the surveyed data and establishes correlations
between the chimneys geometrical and mechanical characteristics. Finally, it proposes simple
