In the early
blastocyst (text-fig. 17), prior to the appearance of the primitive streak mesoderm, the
primitive connecting stalk is already well differentiated and is distinguishable into two
parts, a short, cylindrical, distal part which is continuous above with the chorionic
mesenchyme and a longer proximal part which is attached to the amniotic ectoderm
forming the posterior wall of the primitive amniotic cavity and which extends down to
the level of the proliferating area of ectoderm (mes.p.). From this area, we have
suggested the whole of the primary (extra-embryonal) mesoderm (including that part
of it which forms the primitive connecting stalk) is derived, and though it is not possible
to speak with certainty, it does appear as if the contribution of the primary mesoderm
to the stalk was larger in the Anthropoid than in the Pithecoid. But whether this be
so or not, the important facts remain that in both the primitive connecting stalk consists
at first of so-called primary mesoderm, and that this is later reinforced by the addition
of mesoderm proliferated from the primitive streak. As in Tarsius and the Anthropoids, the endodermal constituent of the connecting
stalk in the Pithecoids normally appears to have the form of a slender tubular (allantoic)
canal with a thickish epithelial wall, which terminates blindly in the mesenchyme of
the proximal portion of the stalk. In the 3-2 mm. embryo of Cebus 475, it measures
in diameter 0-2 x 0-085 mm.
