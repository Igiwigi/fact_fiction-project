duced the shell-lac between A and B, and then for a moment connected B and C,
uninsulated them, and finally left them in the insulated state; the gold leaves were
of course hanging parallel to each other. On removing the shell-lac the gold leaves
attracted each other; on introducing the shell-lac between A and C this attraction
was increased, (as had been anticipated from theory,) and the leaves came together,
though not more than four inches long, and hanging three inches apart.

1312. By simply bringing the gold leaves nearer to each other I was able to show
the difference of specific inductive capacity when only thin plates of shell-lac were
used, the rest of the dielectric space being filled with air. By bringing B and C
nearer to A another great increase of sensibility was made. By enlarging the size of
the plates still further power was gained. By diminishing the extent of the wires, &c.
connected with the gold leaves, another improvement resulted. So that in fact the
gold leaves became, in this manner, as delicate a test of specific inductive action as they
are, in BenxeT's and SinGeR's electrometers, of ordinary electrical charge.

1313. It is evident that by making the three plates the sides of cells, with proper
precautions as regards insulation, &c., this apparatus may be used in the examination
of gases, with far more effect than the former apparatus (1187. 1290.), and may, per-
haps, bring out differences which have as yet escaped me (1292. 1293.),

1314. It is also evident that two metal plates are quite sufficient to form the in-
strument ; the state of the single inducteous plate when the dielectric is changed,
being examined either by bringing a body excited in a known manner towards its
gold leaves, or, what I think will be better, employing a carrier ball in place of the
