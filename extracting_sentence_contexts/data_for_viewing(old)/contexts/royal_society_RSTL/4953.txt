No. 4. P.M. 1" 539.,â€”FZorty-five ova were passed on a dry surface, and were, first
bathed with solution of potass, and then with seminal fluid in water, and afterwards
they were removed with No. 1 and 2, to higher temperature.

At the expiration of the eighth day three embryos had been formed. 'This result at
first appeared to be more difficult of explanation than the former. But, when the
circumstances are considered, it seems to admit of quite as easy an interpretation.
The bathing of the ova freely with seminal fluid mixed with water, five seconds after
the application of the solution of potass, diluted this solution too much to allow of
its effect on the whole of the spermatozoa applied to the ova, while this very dilution
enabled the impregnating influence of thtese bodies to take effect in some of the ova.
The fact, however, leads to an inference of some importance with reference to the
action of the potass on the envelopes of the ovum, and seems to show that this
action is less immediate on the enyelopes than on the spermatozoa.

No. 5. Fifty-nine ova were bathed with seminal fluid and water, and five seconds
afterwards with a solution of nitrate of potass (in the proportion of twenty grains of
the salt to one ounce of water), and water was then added to them.

No. 6. Seventy-two ove were treated in precisely the same way.

Not one embryo was produced in either of these experiments.

No. 7. Fortyfour ova were washed with diluted acetic acid immediately after they
