change of altitude, and it would be rash to attempt to explain the results obtained on
rabbits by our own observations on a limited number of men. The striking point in
ABDERHALDEN’S series of experiments is the rapidity with which the very marked
changes in the concentration of the blood were produced—a rapidity which we should
agree could most easily be explained by a passage of fluid out of or into the blood,

though at the same time we confess that we view with scepticism the prospect of an
animal continuing its existence for long periods with a volume of blood diminished
below its normal, for the normal animal seems to be very conservative in respect to its
blood volume. ‘This tendency, in fact, for the hemoglobin to become concentrated
above its normal value, whether that concentration be due merely to a diminution in
the amount of plasma in the blood or to an actual overproduction of red cells, is rather
remarkable. Apparently we do not get it in those cases where the effective tension
of oxygen in the blood reaching the tissues is not interfered with. Thus after
hemorrhage the blood yolume is usually restored quickly, and there is no tendency in
this case to keep the concentration of hemoglobin at even the normal level. Very
likely the organism makes up for the diminution in the quantity of oxygen per unit
of blood in this case to some extent at least by increasing the general rate of the
circulation. The quantity of oxygen reaching the tissues is here at fault, but not
necessarily its tension.

Besides the effect of low atmospheric oxygen pressures we have other evidence that
