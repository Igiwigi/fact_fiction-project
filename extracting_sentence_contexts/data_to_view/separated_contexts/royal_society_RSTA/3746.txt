The y variation of W, dW/dy, is of central importance, as it is analytically shown
to approach a constant on the domain where the leading-order balance solely involves inertial
terms. In the context of the mean momentum equation, this is the origin of distance-from-the-
wall scaling that underlies a logarithmic mean velocity profile, and recent empirical studies at
high Reynolds number support the onset of logarithmic dependence on the inertial domain as
specified by the present theory (e.g. [5,16]). The features of the theory most relevant to this study relate to the fact that the coordinate
stretching function, ¢, that yields an invariant form of the mean momentum equation across
the entire hierarchy of scaling layers is analytically given by ¢ =dy/dW, and thus this scaling
parameter approaches constancy, ¢ > ¢¢, as the Reynolds number tends to infinity. Indeed, the


theory specifies that $7 =1/«, where « is the leading coefficient in the logarithmic mean profile
equation (i.e. the von Karman constant). By employing a valid but discrete construction of the
layer hierarchy, Klewicki ef al. [11] show that the quantity ¢2/(¢- + 1) approaches a constant
a on the inertial domain, and through a number of empirical measures show that a equals
unity to within a couple of per cent, i.e. within the measurement uncertainty.
