A more serious weakness in the existing theory of elastic stability, when regarded
from the mathematical standpoint, is the fact that the methods which it employs are
admittedly only approximate. The higher the elastic limit} of the material under
consideration, the less adequate are these methods to deal with the whole range of
problems which should come within its scope. In fact, we are faced with the
anomaly that, while in its ordinary applications the theory of elasticity is not
concerned with the conception of an elastic limit, in questions of stability the
existence of finite limits is an essential condition for the adequacy of its results. In
an ideal material, possessing perfect elasticity combined with unlimited strength,
types of instability could occur with which existing methods would be quite
insuflicient to deal. The theory of elastic stability is thus in much the same position as that of the
ordinary theory of elasticity before the discovery of the general equations, and one
aim of the present paper is to remedy its defects by the investigation of general
equations, which may be termed “ Equations of Neutral Equilibrium,” and which
express the condition that a given configuration may be one of limiting equilibrium.
