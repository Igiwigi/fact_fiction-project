= Other results of the same character were obtained, but it is unnecessary to give

them. The values observed and calculated seem in every case to confirm the theo-
retical deductions made by Lord RAYLEIGH.

A comparison of the curves, fig. 9, Plate 25, of the absorbed and unabsorbed lights
will show the modifications which are effected in the spectrum by passing the beam of
light through a turbid medium. That the waves of shorter Jength are more absorbed
than the longer is clear, from the fact that the position of maximum intensity is
n. shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. Tt, will be observed that the clear
q water and glass ends of the trough even have somewhat affected the spectrum, for
there is less convexity in the curve on both sides of the maximum than in the normal

evidence of the light having passed through a considerable quantity of water © stuff,”
