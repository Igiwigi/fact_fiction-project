BY INCREASE OF THE INTRA-CRANIAL PRESSURE OR TENSION 229



230 MESSRS. W. SPENCER AND V. HORSLEY ON THE CHANGES PRODUCED

B. Depressor influences absent, although the pressure was applied for the first

time, and also absent after the arrest of respiration.

This almost inexplicable fact was observed once, as seen in 'l'racing XVI. _ It is
seen that, although the heart became gradually slowed down to 35 per minute, there
was no fall of blood pressure. This absence of depressor influence may have been
connected with the low blood pressure. That vasomotor phenomena, e.g., curves,
could yet be produced is seen in the tracing at a, where it is shown that the pressure
developed vasomotor curves which continued for some time and then disappeared

when the heart was slowed.

y. Depressor influences absent when pressure was applied for the second time,

after having been present on the first application.
