where 3 is the absolute temperature and J the mechanical equivalent of the calorie.
In a former paper the author has shown that a term of this nature is necessary
to represent the variation of the specific heat of substances in the neighbourhood of
the fusion point.* A corresponding term explains, on Weiss’s theory, the variation
of the specific heat of ferro-magnetic substances in the neighbourhood of the
transformation temperature, on the supposition of a ferro-magnetic molecular field
of the order 10’ gauss.t [{The fact that Nernst and Lrypemann§ have found
experimentally an abnormal increase of the specific heat of diamagnetic substances in
addition to the normal variation due to purely translational vibrations, as the fusion
point is approached, is additional evidence of the importance of the rotational
term (17). Derpye’s quantum theory of specific heats is concerned with translational
vibrations of the molecules only, and, away from the fusion point, it agrees well with
experiment. Incidentally, in order that (17) may be a measurable fraction of the
specific heat; a’, and I must be large, for, from experimental data showing the
departure from Drpyr’s theory near the fusion point, the interval of temperature
over which the molecules have effective rotational vibrations amounts to several
degrees at least, so that the large value of (17) cannot be attributed solely to a large
