the two systems may appear. In conjunction with a simple angular measurement taken
from a longitudinal section of the apex it enables the curve system as it exists on the actual
apical surface to be accurately described, just as readily as is that of the transverse com-
ponent. Furthermore, its counterpart, the plastochrone ratio (into which it is easily
transformed), when considered in relation to the plastochrone period, will frequently give
valuable information concerning growth rates within the apex. Finally, the methods, being
based entirely on strict analysis, provide data with which any theory of leaf-positioning
must be in harmony. The failure of past classificatory systems has been due to their deriva-
tion from some particular, and false, phyllotaxis theory, so that the data collected have little
more permanent value than the theory itself; indeed, by a regrettable inversion, the facts
of phyllotaxis have frequently been falsified in order to conform with the postulates.

In ยง 12 some applications of the methods advocated are illustrated, using published
data, but prior to this certain practical points relating to the collection of data are con-
sidered in the following paragraphs.

11. SOME PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

In the practical determination of plastochrone ratio and phyllotaxis index it is occa-
sionally possible to take the necessary measurements directly from a plan of the apex.
This is eminently true of many fern apices, for which camera lucida drawings of the region
are sufficient. In ferns practical difficulties are minimized in a second way, for the apical
