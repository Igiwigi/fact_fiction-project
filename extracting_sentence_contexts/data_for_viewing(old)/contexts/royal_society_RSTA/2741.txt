in Heaviside’s eyes as well. In 1896, Searle published corrections to Heaviside’s point charge
analysis, arriving at expressions including the same famous factor of //1 — (u2/v2) that appeared
in the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction hypothesis, indicating that they were probing at the very
edges of relativistic electrodynamics [23].

4. Faster-than-light

An immediate, impossible to overlook implication of the predicted mass variation with speed is
the infinity that occurs at the speed of light. This result is generally interpreted today to mean
that nothing with a non-zero rest mass can travel as fast as light (in a vacuum). Searle studied
the electromagnetic effects of moving charges for decades and accepted that conclusion, but
Heaviside never did. Scattered all through his books, in fact, are analyses concerning charges
moving faster-than-light (FTL), with the earliest dating from 1888 [24]. This caused Searle much
frustration as, for example, when he wrote in his 1896 paper ‘Mr. Heaviside has stated the result
when u is greater than v [the speed of light], but has not up to the present divulged the manner
in which he has obtained the solution in this case’. Searle was referring to a cryptic Heaviside
comment in Electrical Papers, where he states a result for u > v and then writes ‘I regret that there
is no space for the mathematical investigation, which cannot be given in a few words’ [25]. Just
like Fermat's Last Theorem scribbled in a book page margin!

The following year (1897) Searle published a continuation of his 1896 paper, in which he
worked out the energy associated with moving charged ellipsoids. His closing words were ‘In
all these cases it will be found that when u =v the energy becomes infinite, so it would seem to be
impossible to make a charged body move at a greater speed than that of light’ [26]. Heaviside
