wrought before the transference took place.

B. Another set of larvee were blinded, and (August 16, evening) placed in a cylinder
of almost the same size (2°16 decimetres in internal diameter, and 1°02 decimetres in
height), with a similar roof and floor and amount of food, and the same conditions of
light. It is, however, to be noted as very important that these Jarvee had not been
previously exposed to the influence of a white roof, but were taken from a cylinder
covered with a sheet of green glass, the whole being placed upon the floor in the
shadow of the table. To compensate for this, the least mature larvee were selected,
i.e., those which, as far as possible, were feeding, or had not passed beyond Stage I. of
the period before pupation. Nevertheless, the comparison with A, is unsatisfactory,
because in selecting the least advanced larvee out of very large numbers the results
are liable to be influenced by the fact that such larvee are often less healthy than the
others, and frequently do not ultimately attain the average size. On August 21 the
following results were obtained :—
