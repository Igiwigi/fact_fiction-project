Sometimes only one” lobe will move over to the seat of
irritation, but it is more usual for two, or even more, of the four lobes to take part in
these localizing movements. These movements, however, are not performed with
nearly 80 much activity and precision as they are in the case of Tiaropss mdicans;
they are, comparatively speaking, of a very sluggish and somewhat uncertain character,
never beginning till a number of seconds, perhaps even half a minute, after the
application of the stimulus, and the lobes of the polypite then sweeping slowly back-
wards and forwards over a large area of the umbrella, instead of being quickly and
invariably applied to the precise spot that was stimulated.

$ 4. Effects of alternating the direction of the constant current on the excitable tis81es
of the Medus@.—Tt is a fact known to physiologists that, in the muscular tissues of the
higher animals, the stimulus which is supplied by make and break of the constant
current becomes less and less effective as a stimulus the more frequently the current is

passed in the same direction, and that on reversing the direction of the current the
stimulations which are snpplied by make and break again rise to their original value.
