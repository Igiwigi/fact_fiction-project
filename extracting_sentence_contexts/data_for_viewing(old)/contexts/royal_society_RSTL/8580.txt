thick.

* At 10.18 the fog began to break, and the sounds were not again heard.

© At the Vane light-ship, 12% miles from the lighthouse, the master reports that from
8 A.M. to 10.30 a.M. they heard the © horns distinet but not loud.”

« At the South Sand Head light-ship the sounds were plainly heard on Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday during the fog.”

The results here recorded are of the highest importance, for they bring us face to face
with a dense fog and an actual fog-signal, and confirm in the most satisfactory manner
the previously recorded obseryations. 'The fact of Captain ATKINS and Mr. EDwARDS being
awakened by the sound of the syren, proves, beyond all our previous experience, the power
of the sound on the 7th of February.

It is important also to note that through the same fog the sounds were well heard at
the South Sand Head light-vessel, which is in the opposite direction from the South
Foreland, and, as will immediately appear, actually behind the syren.

It is exceedingly interesting to compare the transmission of sound on February 7
