We may in short summarise thus :-—

Source approaching shortens waves,

Receiver approaching alters virtual velocity,

Medium flowing alters wave-length and velocity together, in an exactly
compensatory manner. Steady Motion of Mediwm cannot cause any Doppler Effect.

54. Before abandoning the present consideration of the Doppler effect, let us dis-
tinctly assure ourselves of the important fact that no steady motion of the medium
can change the pitch even infinitesimally, unless source and receiver are moving
relatively to each other. Let source recede with velocity v, then the wave-lengths
approaching us at their ordinary velocity V are longer than usual,

Ge)
ie v xr. Let receiver approach with same velocity, then it sweeps up per second a number
of waves

So, without relative motion of source and receiver, there is no Doppler effect,
however small.
