1858), several of these hard blocks, from 12 to 16 inches in diameter, had just been
out of the black sand in a vineyard adjoining the Bastione. The whole depoxsit,
Ancluding the tuff, resembles the transported materials observable in the wide water-
courses which furrow the western slopes and base of Etna. Below the above-mentioned
tuff and loose sand is seen another current of lava 40 feet thick, also having red or burnt
tuff below it, and below that again there appear, in the face of the cliff on the left hand
as we descend the Scalazza, a series of other beds, among which are four lavas, each
reposing on red and altered tuffs or soils.]
To return to the inclined dolerite of the Bastione: we have first to consider whether
it can poxsibly have acquired its present dip, averaging about 26*, in consequence of a
- landlip or any other movement posterior to its original congelation. That it has not
done 80, is demonstrated by the fact that it is a continuous part of an unbroken and unin-
terrupted lava-current, the uppermost part of which can be traced for seyeral hundred
