CHAPTER 111,

(73) Although in the course of these researches I have carefully endeayoured +
investigate the facts independently of any particular physiological views with which
they might seem to be connected, I shall nevertheless conclude this memoir with a few
remarks on some of the physiological and pathological points which they either modi fy
or explain. :

(74) Before the publication of my memoir © On the Medulla Oblongata,” in 1858, j
was believed by anatomists that the decussating fibres of the anterior pyramids are con
tinuous only with the lateral columns of the opposite side of the spinal cord. T haye
shown, however, that they are connected not only with the 7ateral, but with the anterior
columns, and with both the anterior and posterior grey s#6stance. These facts, which
must modify to a certain extent the current opinion concerning the functions of the
anterior pyramids, have been confirmed by the investigations of M. VULPiax, announced
in his recent and valuable work on the © Physiology of the Nervous System*. © Nog
