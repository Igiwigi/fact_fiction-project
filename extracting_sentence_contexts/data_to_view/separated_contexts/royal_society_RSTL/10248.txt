Trans. Vol. 166, 1876, p. 121): * It seems extremely difficult to reconcile the extraordinary
8uccession of the mesenteries in the development of the Zoantharians, discovered by
Lacaze-DuTaERs, with the facts presented by Alcyonarians. Did the development
of the eight mesenteries of Aleyonaria correspond with that of the firs eight
mexgenteries formed in Actiniade, the firss mesenteries formed would be either the
lateral dorsal or lateral ventral; but these are those which are most rudimentary in
the zooids of Sarcophyton. Moreover the mesenterial filaments of the two lateral
pairs of septa are in the development of Actiniades the first to appear, and nob the
dorsal, which are longest in the Alcyonarian polyps and most persistent in the
zooids.
