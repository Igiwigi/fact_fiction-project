as near as might be to the larval esophagus and rectum. Viewed therefore from the aboral (larval right)
side, the main curvature of the adult food canal must run in the sinistral (see note on p. 217) direction.
In A. rubens this curvature, though almost obscured out of recognition, should be counted as practically
accomplishing a full circle, since at metamorphosis the stalk (a remnant of the larval preoral lobe) is last
found in inter-radius V/I, i.e., the anal inter-radius.

(a) Double Hydrocale.

A surprisingly large number of the larvee developed double hydroccele. Adequate
description of the condition will entail a separate paper, but the following facts should
be noted here, since they have a bearing on the homologies of certain important
structures, particularly the hydroccele, the dorsal sac, the epigastric and the hypo-
gastric ccelom. In perfect double-hydroccele larvee the right enteroccele behaved
exactly like the left one in the following respects: (1) The right posterior ccelom
became cut off completely from the right middle ccelom (¢f. p. 242). (2) The antero-
ventral corner of the right posterior coelom extended downwards and to the left,
further than in the normal condition, forming a ventral “horn.” This horn met and
united near the middle line with the corresponding horn of the /.p.c., and from the
common cavity there grew up folds which finally encircled the rectum (cf. p. 244).
(3) Five hydroccele lobes developed in the wall of the r.mc. (cf p. 243). (4) A
secondary communication became established between the dorsal horn of the r.p.c. and
r.m.c. (of. p. 243). (5) In very late larvee a stone-canal groove and the rudiment of
