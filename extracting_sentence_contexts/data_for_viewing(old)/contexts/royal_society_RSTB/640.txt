Dog, and those of Brown-Siquarp, distinctly oppose such a theory. But it is
possible to conceive that the grey matter is connected at different levels by a series of
short ascending commissural connecting fibres. The sensory elements are thus brought
into relation with one another, just as we believe the motor cell elements are. Above a
hemisection there is always a very extensive degeneration in the whole of the lateral
column except the crossed pyramidal tract, which degeneration diminishes upwards
until none is left except that belonging to the two long tracts of the lateral column.
Of course, some of these degenerated fibres are fibres on their way to form these two
tracts, as I have previously shown; but the great bulk are short ascending internun-
cial fibres.

So far, I have only dealt with the experimental side of the question. I have still
to give a brief résumé of the more important facts which clinical practice and patho-
logical examination afford.

On the experimental side, we have little difficulty in exactly localizing the lesion,
and the fallacies arise when we come to test the results of it, for nothing is more diffi-
cult than to test the different forms of sensibility in animals. This objection, however,
which is always raised by purely clinical observers, is not so great in the Monkey as
in the Dog, as I think the results of my experiments show.

On the other hand, experimental physiologists retort—the lesion in clinical cases
can never be localized with any degree of precision, as it arises from accident or
disease, and, unfortunately, with very few exceptions indeed, the post-mortem
examination and subsequent microscopical research have either not been made at all, or
