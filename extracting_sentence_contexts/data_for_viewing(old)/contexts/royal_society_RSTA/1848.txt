As mentioned in the introduction, the depth and significance of the periodic system and the {=
manner that it unifies all the elements might suggest that these features necessitate a unified ia
treatment of the elements. A pragmatist could insist that the purpose of the periodic table lies : =
in teaching and explaining chemical phenomena and that the current 18-column format serves : =
those purposes well. In the present article, we prefer to take a more philosophical approach. 1B
The discovery of the periodic system represents one of the major achievements in all of modern : =
science. The periodic table is of course an attempt to provide a visual representation of the DR
periodic system, namely the fact that elements recur in an approximate fashion after certain : o
intervals. From this holistic or global perspective, it makes sense to want to emphasize the unity 8
of the periodic system and to treat all of the elements on an equal footing, rather than retaining : ยง
the separation of the f-block elements that is a historical hangover from the time when it was not : S
clear how these elements should be regarded (Mendeleev and the other pioneers of the periodic 7S

table had great difficulty in accommodating the rare earth elements which form a large fraction
of the f-block. Mendeleev is known to have given up this task to his colleague Brauner (see [11]).

Moreover, the periodic system has served as a motivation for many developments in physics
as well as chemistry. For example, it was highly influential upon the ideas of J.J. Thomson, Niels
Bohr, Henry Moseley, Edmund Stoner and Wolfgang Pauli [12]. So although the periodic table was
discovered by chemists in the context of chemical education, and in wanting to explain chemical
