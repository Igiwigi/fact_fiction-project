the Cristellarian and the Marginuline Nodosarine is to be found in Professor BaiLey's
«« Microscopical Examination of Soundings made by the United States' Coast-survey off
the Atlantic Coast of the United States” (Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,
vol. ii. 1851), where two forms (Robuling D Orbignii and Marginulina Bacheii, Bailey),
equivalent to the above, accompany each other in soundings of from 51 to 90 fathoms.

Oristellaria Orepidula, Fichtel and Moll, &p. Plate XIIL. figs. 15, 16 @, 16 6 (Arctic); |
Plate XVI. fig. 4 (North Atlantic).

We have here a very insensible gradation from Marginuling Lituus (fig. 14). In fact
fig. 15 differs but little from the latter except in size; and fig. 16 is merely somewhat
more closely coiled, flatter, and shorter ; thus putting on the true Cristellarian form.

These specimens are from dredgings made at the Hunde Islands by Dr. P. C. SuTHER-
LAND ; they are rather common in the sandy mud, rich with shells, at from 30 to 40 and
60 to 70 fathoms.

In recent occurrence OC. Crepiduls is as world-wide as the ordinary Dentaling. It is a
feeble form of Cristellaria creeping up from the favourite depth of Cristellarie (50 to 100
fathoms) to shallow water, and downwards to abyssal deeps.

In the fossil state also it has an equally wide range ; but, like its congeners, it is met
