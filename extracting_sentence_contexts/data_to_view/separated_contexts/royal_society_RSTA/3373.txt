This disagreement could be due to the range of velocities explored, much larger than
in the theory, and to the lattice strength, much lower than in the theory [34]. Nevertheless,
new theoretical studies performed in the regime of shallow lattices have demonstrated that the
experimentally observed v-independent regime is well described by a TAPS mechanism [36]. By predicting the damping rate G induced by thermally activated phase slips in the regime
of low velocity and weak interaction, in fact, the theory shows a good agreement with the
experimental values, thus suggesting the interpretation of thermal activation in the v < v* regime. Furthermore, the damping rates measured with large velocity and large interaction, whose
values are definitely larger than the calculations with the TAPS assumption, strongly suggest a
quantum activation of phase slips in this regime. The experimental results are thus compatible
with the TAPS to QPS crossover.
