Equation (4.3) is in the form of a Kuramoto equation [22], with a coupling strength K = Jqc/vty.
We remark that in equation (4.3) an effective long-range interaction between the ‘oscillators’ (i.e.
the atoms) is mediated by the light field, which thus offers the possibility of implementing a
mean-field model with all-to-all coupling in a simple and powerful way.

With a Lorentzian initial condition for the natural frequencies (2;(0), the Kuramoto model (4.3)
is known to lead to a synchronization transition when the driving exceeds the critical value
K>K* =204, = 2qcvth [22]. Hence, we recover the power threshold obtained in [15] and reported
above: pin = (2Ro xo)~!. As discussed in [15], with a Gaussian initial condition, a slightly different
growth rate is found for the instability, but the threshold condition is unchanged. Because
the synchronization transition leads to a bunching of the fictitious oscillators around the (self-
selected) phase w, in the x-space this corresponds to the formation of complementary periodic
structures ~ cos(q-x — ) for the atomic density and the optical intensity. We remark that the sign
of the optical potential is positive for blue detuning (5 > 0) and negative for red detuning (5 < 0),
so that when 5 > 0 the density and optical profiles are shifted by half a wavelength (figures 2
and 4). The onset of the optomechanical instability can thus be reinterpreted as a Kuramoto
transition to a synchronized state with a self-selected phase y where the threshold for this
process is determined by the initial spread of the oscillator frequencies. Physically, this spread is
determined by the initial temperature of the gas and is therefore tunable experimentally, whereas
the coupling strength K is tunable through the injected pump po.

We numerically solved the coupled dynamics (3.1)-(3.2) of the phase-space distribution
f(x,v,t) and the optical field in one transverse dimension using a semi-Lagrangian method
