of union with the intestine are placed obliquely to the line of the muscularis mucosa ;
they penetrate that membrane and become continuous with BRUNNER's glands, as has
been seen to be the case in other animals.

Numerous lymphoid follicles were found at the point of union of the stomach and
intestine in man, and they were found in that situation to some extent in all the animals
which were examined.

This lymphoid tissue has been shown to occur in very yarying amount at this point
of the alimentary canal in the dog, the mucosa being sometimes almost free from it, and
at other times composed in a great measure of lymphatic follicles. 'This latter condition
was found to be the case in dogs which were kept on a very low diet. I wish to lay par-
ticular stress on these facts, as this great excess of lymphatic tisxue may in itself con-
stitute a pathological condition, and may be connected with some of those pathological
changes 80 frequently met with in this part of the alimentary canal.

EXPLANATION OF PLATES 39-43,

The outlines of many of the preparations were drawn with an OBERnagussR's Camera
Tncida: in such cases the lens used with the Camera Tacida and the approximate mag-
nification are given. The ocular, and objective which were used in completing the
drawings are also given.

The preparations from which these drawings are made were hardened in chromic acid
and alcohol, except where the contrary is expressly stated in the following explanations.
