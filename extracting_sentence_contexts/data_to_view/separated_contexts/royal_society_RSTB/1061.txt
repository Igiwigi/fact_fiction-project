violet. To the right of H is the ultra-violet, of course invisible. Several facts are obvious at a glance. In the first place the bactericidal
begins almost exactly on the boundary between the green and the blue, i.e., atthe

line F in the photograph,‚Äù and, in the lower spectrum, extends right away inteth

ultra-violet. In the upper spectrum this extension of the effect into the ultr

is much curtailed, owing to the opacity of the glass for these rays.
