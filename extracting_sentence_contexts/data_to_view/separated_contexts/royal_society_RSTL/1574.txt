bituminous and vitrifiable, agglutinate, and form substances
resembling pumice, is a 8ubject which may throw some light
upon the natural formation of that substance. The conversion of obsdzan into a species of pumice, and the
proof that it contains bitumen, will probably be considered
as supporting the mineralogical arrangement, which places
that curious substance in connection with pitch-stone. As it appears from the facts here detailed that bitumen, or
a volatile inflammable oil, exists in considerable proportion,
and in chemical union, with all the rocks of the Floetz Trap
formation, is it a far-fetched mference to consider that forma-
tion as the chief source, whatever its own origin may have
been, of the ejected volcanic products ? The appearance of an inflammable substance in the lower
or elder rocks, such as mica, slate, &c, and, in particular, the
exception in favour of colourless rock crystal and adularia,
will probably obtain the attention of geologists,

It is observable also, that in the last named rocks, the
quantity of the volatile and inflammable ingredients is less
than in the upper or more recent formations, and that it seems
also to be more firmly united. If the scintillation of pulverised stones, when projected
upon boiling nitre, be a test of their containing carbon, the
experiments made with that object, demonstrate how much
more generally that inflammable substance is distributed
through the mineral kingdom, than was supposed ; and may
account for much of the loss which the best chemists and most
experienced manipulators are often obliged to acknowledge
in their analyses.
