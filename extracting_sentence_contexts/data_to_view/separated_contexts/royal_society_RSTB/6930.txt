First, there is the force, termed
the cell inertia, which must be overcome before any tissue can react by cell division to the presence
of an oestrogen. In the case of less active tissues the cell inertia is great, and is overcome only after
the oestrogen has exerted its influence for several days, but in the more active tissues the cell inertia.
is slight, and is rapidly overcome by relatively small increases in the oestrogen blood content. The
existence of a second mitosis inhibitor, termed the mitosis depressor, is shown by the fact that any
sharp rise in mitotic activity is quickly brought under control, so that mitosis is again reduced to a
minimum. With the continued presence of the stimulating oestrogen, there is, after a short interval,
a second rise in mitotic activity which, like the first, is rapidly brought under control and in turn
eliminated. Thus, even in the continued presence of oestrogen stimulation, mitotic activity proceeds
in waves.
