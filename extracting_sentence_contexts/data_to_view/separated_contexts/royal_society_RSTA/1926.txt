With
13 constraints, the equilibrium distribution matches the moments of the Maxwell—Boltzmann
distribution not only for the conserved moments, as does the 5-moment approach, but also for
higher-order, non-conserved moments. In this manner, the behaviour of the macroscopic flow
variables, which are related to the moments of the particle populations, can be more adequately
represented using as few as 39 discrete velocities in 3D, by putting more effort into the equilibrium
instead of the lattice. This is explained by the fact that the desired moments of the distribution are
strictly enforced with the help of a numerical solver. Hence, they no longer depend on the choice
of a sophisticated discrete velocity stencil, or at least, the dependency is highly reduced. Here, the choice of a D3Q39 velocity discretization is motivated by recent improvements
obtained with hybrid LBMs based on the same lattice, and which successfully simulated flows
around realistic geometries in the high-subsonic, transonic and supersonic regimes with a wall-
clock time that competes with Navier-Stokes—Fourier solvers [22,44,45].
