especially in the hands of non-scientific persons.

1st. The reduction of the air temperature to that of the dew-point is effected by
the rapid evaporation of sulphuric ether from a hollow ball of glass covered with fine
muslin. Now ether is rather an expensive material, and it is essential that it should
be unadulterated and of the strongest description, and such cannot always be ob-
tained, even in large towns. An old established and respectable druggist tells me,
that until recently (and the practice probably still exists in many places) it was the
invariable custom of the trade to mix one part of spirits of wine with every two parts
of ether. And I remember examining some ether in use by a young friend who pro-
fessed to take hygrometrical observations with this instrament, which I should say
contained a still larger proportion of alcohol in combination with water. This ana-
lysis of its composition is based on the fact that it might be used ad libitum, without
depressing the temperature more than two or three degrees. Long experience has
convinced me, that unless the evaporating fluid be pure, the results, if obtained at all,
cannot be depended upon. 'The Ether rect. fort. should, if possible, be employed.

2nd. Some experience, great care and a quick eye, are requisite to secure accurate
observations, and to catch the temperature at the exact moment when the annulus of
dew begins to form on the dark bulb in the plane of the internal liquid surface,

3rd. If the ether be dropped on the bulb too quickly, too high a dew-point will be
obtained. The ether phial should be fitted with a small siphon, and the heat com-
municated to the fluid by the hand will be sufficient to force it out slowly in drops.
