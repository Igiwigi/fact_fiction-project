this subject. All this will appear still more extraordinary, when the law,
that the quantity of respiration and the degree of the irritability are, in fact,
inverse throughout all the series, stages, and states of animated being, is
clearly established. It is well known that the irritability of the heart and of the muscular fibre
in general, is greater in the mammalia than in birds, and in reptiles and the
amphibia than in the mammalia, whether we judge of it by the force and
duration of the beat of the heart, exposed to the stimulus of the atmospheric
air, or by the contractions of the other parts of the muscular system. Now
this is precisely the order of the quantity of respiration in these animals, as
ascertained by the pneumatometer, inyerted.
