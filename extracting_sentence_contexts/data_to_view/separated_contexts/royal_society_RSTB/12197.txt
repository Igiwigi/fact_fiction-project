The line-
arity during extension, the extent of hysteresis, and the shape
of the stress-strain curve were also the same in preliminary
trials at a strain rate that was roughly ten times greater
(0.5-1 s~?). The energy dissipation occurred continuously during
extension and was not the result of reaching a critical value. This can be seen by the fact that the hysteresis occurred
regardless of what strain the glue reached. When stretching
a sample through progressively larger strains, with a return
to the original length after each extension, the same extent
of hysteresis was seen at all strains (figure 4b). Interestingly,
every time the sample was re-stretched after returning to
the original length, the stress while re-extending matched
the low values of the previous return phase.
