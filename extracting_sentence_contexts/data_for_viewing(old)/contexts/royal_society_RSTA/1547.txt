replicate their simulations (green curve on their paper). Figure 2a of Ellis et al. presents measured
and simulated reflectances of SiC pillar arrays with a 500-nm gap. All their measurements and
simulations were performed with 22° off-normal angle of incidence and incoming polarization
parallel to the elongated side of the pillar.

Using PyGBe, we computed the extinction cross-section of an isolated SiC pillar (AR = 4) with
no substrate, submerged in air under a constant electric field in the z-direction, and rotated the
orientation of the pillar to match the angle of incidence used by Ellis et al. (figure 7). In figure 9, we
present a comparison of our simulations and the experimental results of Ellis et al. A difference
in the wavelengths of the peaks is noticeable. This may be attributed to the fact that in their
experiments the separation between pillars is 500nm, which implies there are coupling effects
that in our simulations are not considered.

First-order correction. Since our simulations do not take into account coupling effects in an array
of prisms, we cannot strictly match the conditions to validate our solver. However, from figure S4
