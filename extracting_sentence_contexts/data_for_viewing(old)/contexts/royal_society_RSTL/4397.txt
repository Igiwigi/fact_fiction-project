a given time in any wire depends on the relative positions of the earth connections,
if the insulation is good, however circuitous may be the route of the wire itself. For
example, the telegraph from Derby to Rugby, forty-nine miles in length, proceeds
for ten miles about S.E. by E.'to Kegworth ; then for nineteen miles it takes a S.E.
direction to Leicester, and the remaining twenty miles to Rugby is about S.S.W.

Having one earth connection at Derby, if the other be made at Rugby, the bearing
of which place from Derby is S. 15? E.; the deflections accord with those of the wire
to Birmingham, bearing $. 29* W. ; but if the earth connection of the Rughy wire be
changed from Rugby to Kegworth, the bearing of which from Derby is $. 62? E., the
deflections produced are in the contrary direction to those of the Birmingham wire.

I do not consider that this fact in itself proves that the currents are generated in
the earth, for they might arise from other causes, and yet exhibit the same result.
I only mention the fact in this place to facilitate the consideration of the direction
in which the currents alternate, and to indicate that when the direction of the cur-
rent between any two places is described, it is not meant that the wire is laid in a
direct line between the two points, but that the earth connections are $0 placed.

Referring the direction of deflection in every case to those produced by the
Birmingham wire, and denoting those which accord with it by the sign +, and those
which exhibit a contrary deflection —, the results of the experiments on direction
were as follows :;—

Derby to Willington, bearing . . . . SW. +
