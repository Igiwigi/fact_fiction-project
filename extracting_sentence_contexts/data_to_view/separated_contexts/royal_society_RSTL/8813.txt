Dr. BasTIAN's proof of Bacterial death
at 140? Fans. consists solely in the observed fact, that when a certain liquid is heated to
that temperature no life appears in it afterwards. In another liquid, however, he finds
that life appears two days after it has been heated to 212%, Instead of concluding logi-
cally that in the one liquid life is destroyed and in the other not, he chooses to asxume
arbitrarily that 140* Fans. is the death-temperature for both ; and this being s0, the life
observed in the second liquid figures, in his inference, as a case of spontaneous generation. A great deal of Dr.
