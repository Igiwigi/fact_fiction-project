cells still show no granulation but there are now two kinds of cells present, one with
a round nucleus and one with a lobed nucleus. In the adult all these three types are
undoubtedly present. Thus we find a certain phylogenetic and ontogenetic support
for the statement that the very divergent elements of the sporadic mesoblast have a
morphological homogeneity in the fact that they have arisen from a primitive amoeboid
wandering cell with no specifie granulation, by a process of morphological and
physiological differentiation akin to that which has, pari passu, led to the increasing
complexity of the animal generally. &

Undoubtedly the wandering cells are present
largely as a protective mechanism to guard against the intrusion of foreign substances,
living or non-living, into the organism. But. this is probably only a small part, and
not the most primitive of their functions. They are also related to the general
processes of the body, notably to the bodily nutrition. In Daphnia they may be
readily watched engaged in the transportation of fatty particles from the alimentary
canal to its place of storage.t Also any abnormal condition of the perivisceral fluid, 4
blood, leads to the massing of these cells around the special excretory organs of thi

animal, and this fact suggests that their activities are partly directed to maintaining
the normal constitution of the body fluids so far as the dissolved matters are
