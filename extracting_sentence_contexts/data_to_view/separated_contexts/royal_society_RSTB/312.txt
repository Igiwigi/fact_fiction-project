Similar cells I have observed to occur in both the cervical and in the lumbar regions
of the cord, and have seen examples in the Monkey and Cat, as well as in Man and
in the Dog. They have somewhat the appearance of being aberrant members of a
group of cells which occurs scattered in more or less broken fashion along the deeper
part of the mesial edge of the ventral grey horn, and best seen just above the lumbar
enlargement. â€˜This group was called attention to in the Human cord by Prox,* and is
characterised, according to him, by the fact that the cells give off large processes into
the fibre-bundles of the white commissure. The references to out-lying cells in the anterior column which I have been able to
discover are three. The earliest by Torquato Bertsso in 1878 ; he figures a specimen,
which was obtained from the cord of the Ox.
