ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE STARFISH 149

2—Lange’s Nerve

Lange’s nerve consists of that part of the motor system of the asteroid which is
developed in connexion with the radial cord and circumoral nerve ring. Above the
radial cord, and divided by the connective tissue septum, is the radial perihaemal
cavity (fig. 23, rad. per. c.) the wall of which is lined by coelomic epithelium (coel.
epith.). The fibrillae of Lange’s nerve are to be found only in a part of the epithelium
and are, in fact, confined to the lateral third of the epithelial tissue overlying the
radial cord (fig. 23, lang. n.). The cytoplasm of the coelomic epithelium bordering

the septum, and overlying the median part of the cord, is granular in appearance,
and is clearly demarcated from the fibrillar region of the motor nerve. A longi-
