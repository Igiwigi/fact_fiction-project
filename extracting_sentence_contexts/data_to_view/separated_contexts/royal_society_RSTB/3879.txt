The results are therefore in complete accord with the views of inheritance
in mixed populations upheld by JoHannsEn. There is another method by which we can determine whether there was any
inheritance of intraclonal variation. The material for this is provided by the fact
that two lines were bred from each clone, so that in each generation a pair of
members of each clone was selected for parentage. We can see therefore whether
the large members of these pairs had larger offspring than the small members
or not. The number of individuals available for this investigation is less than for the
previous one, owing to the fact that of course all those pairs of which the two
members were of equal size, or of which one died, had to be rejected.
