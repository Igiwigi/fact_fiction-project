This opportunistic bacterial pathogen of humans lives as a of the CC97 strain from livestock into humans. In fact, phylo-
commensal within the nasal cavity, but can also cause soft genetic comparisons of human lineages with other livestock
tissue abscesses and a range of serious invasive diseases CC97 showed two independent jumps into humans from
[39,A0]. It is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired the major bovine S. aureus complex, one of which has now
infections, although infections outside of hospitals have emerged globally [46]. Human isolates of CC97 have since
increased in frequency in the past decade [41].
