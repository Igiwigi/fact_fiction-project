the vessel, since this protracted increasing of the pressure in a vacuum was not
observed after a wire had been heated in other gases. Even if the above large
amount of gas has to be got rid of the rate of escape seems very slow; in fact, the
numbers show thai the law for the rate of diffusion of hydrogen through hot platinum

does not hold at low pressures. It is probable that at these pressures it is necessary
to take external dissociation into account (vide loc, cit.).

Whilst the preceding measurements of the rate of evolution of hydrogen were
being recorded, readings of the current with —18 volts on the filament were taken
simultaneously. This value of the potential was used in order to ensure saturation
(see fig. 15) and at the same time to avoid the occurrence of ionisation by collisions
as far as possible. The readings were commenced at a pressure of 0°3 millim., and
the current was found to decrease by about 40 per cent. of its value on reducing the
pressure to 0°002 millim. This additional part of the current, which is nearly
