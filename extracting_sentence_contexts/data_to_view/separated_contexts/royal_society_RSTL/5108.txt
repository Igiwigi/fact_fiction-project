Cape of Good Hope. On the average of the year the easterly is decidedly a smaller

eleven months of the, year, the average annual easterly disturbance being consider-

value of a disturbed easterly observation is less than a westerly on the average of
the year; the difference is however in this case inconsiderable, and there are Several
discrepancies in the different months. Next, distributing the disturbances into the several hours of their occurrence, the
following table is obtained.
