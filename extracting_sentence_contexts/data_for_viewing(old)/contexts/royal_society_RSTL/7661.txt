We also conclude from the above deduced values, not only that the resistance dimi-
nishes with the temperature, but also that the diminution of resistance is greater for
equal increments of temperature at higher than at lower temperatures.

$ 53. The first of these results, namely, that resistance diminishes with increase of
temperature, agrees fully with the result given in $$ 43, 46, that the rate of penetration
t is less for less temperature-differences than for greater ones. The cause of the more
speedy penetration of great heats is in fact due to the less resistance offered to the pas-
8age of the heat by those portions of the liquid which have already been heated.

$ 54. In experimenting in the manner described in $$ 15, 16, M. Desererz con-
cluded that the conductivities of fresh and salt water were virtually the same. The im-
portant cosmical bearing of this question induced me to examine it by means of the dia-
thermometer, and at the same time to examine the relative conducting-powers or resist-
ances of some other aqueous solutions. Preliminary experiments having shown that the
resistances of such solutions were very nearly the same as that of water, I have preferred
for the present the examination of saturated, or nearly saturated solutions to those which
: contain either equal or equivalent amounts of solid salt. The solutions of the pure
