By altering the angle of M’ a new set of readings could be obtained, till
every part of the annulus had been tested. By altering the position of the slit, 8, in
the spectrum, the obstruction coefficient for any colour could be arrived at. It will
be seen that by this method one beam of light alone is utilized in a very simple
method, and is in fact a modification of the method adopted when graduating wedges
in white light, as described in the monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
four years ago, From the extreme red to beyond G no difference was found in the
“ obstruction” coefficients above that which would arise from pure error in observa-
tion. The following is the adopted coefficient for the annulus mostly employed :-—

TasLE I.—Scale of Wedge, the coefficient being 0086 for each degree. rem ¥y Value of the light : \Value of the light |
