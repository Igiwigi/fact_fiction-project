In an earlier paper (1) Hormeister had observed a pit at the apex of the pollen
tube in certain Abietines. This pit he figures in Pinus Lari (Larix europea D.C.),
but remarks that it seems always to be closed by the primary wall of the tube. SrrasBurGER in 1869 (4) pointed out that certain errors had crept into
Hormetster’s description of fertilization of the Abietines, errors which were largely
due to the fact that HormuisrEr examined his sections in water. STRASBURGER also
used fresh material, but mounted his sections in white of egg. He came to the
conclusion that Hormxisrer’s cells and nuclei in the corpusculum were nothing more
than granular masses produced in the cytoplasm by the disorganising action of water.
