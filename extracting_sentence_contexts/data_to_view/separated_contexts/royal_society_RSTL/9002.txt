J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZE.

the adjacent lithoeyst, thus cansing it to originate another wave which, in turn, is just
able to pass to the next lithocyst in the series, and s0 on, each lithocyst in turn acting
like a reinforcing battery to the passage of the contractile wave” *. Now this fact, T
think, sufficiently explains the mechanism of ganglionic action in those cases where one
or more lithocysts are prepotent over the others ; that is to say, the prepotent lithocyst
first originates a contractile wave, which is then 8uccessively reinforced by all the other
lithoeysts during its passage round the swimming-bell. In this way the passage of a con-
tractile wave is no doubt somewhat accelerated ; for I found, in marginal strips, that the
rate of transit from a terminal lithocyst to the other end of the strip was somewhat
lowered by excising the seven intermediate lithocysts.

(5) T may here state, in passing, a point of some little interest in connexion with this
reinforcing action of lithocysts. When I first obseryed this action, it appeared to me a
mysterious thing why its result was always to propagate the contractile waye in only
one direction—the direction, namely, in which the wave happened to be passing before
it reached the lithocyst.
