again, with the fact that quantum objects do not possess information. No information carried
from an earlier position measurement (answering the question about the position of the object)
has any relevance for any subsequent momentum measurement (asking the question about the
momentum of the object). This fact renders this earlier information meaningless as concerns
future predictions. Each quantum measurement is unique, and non-commutativity of QM reflects
this uniqueness, including in the case of two reversed complementary measurements, which
give us different outcomes, in contrast to classical physics. There these outcomes are the same,
because, neglecting, as one can, the interference of observational instruments, both variables
can be determined jointly at any moment in time. Even if one measures only one, the other is



definable, thus reflecting the fact that one decides to know one or the other aspect of the same
reality, which is not complementarity in Bohr’s sense. The future course of reality is classically
causally predetermined as well. There is no uncertainty relation or complementarity in Bohr’s
sense. By contrast, in deciding to establish one or the other complementarity phenomenon in
quantum physics one defines a new, singular or unique, reality and a new, unique, future course
of reality.

What is, however, akin to quantum physics in Q-L human situations is the essential
individuality or singularity, uniqueness, of human thinking of each person and of each of its
instances [30,34].!4 This singularity is a key aspect of the Q-L situation, which is, I would argue,
missed or underappreciated by Wang and Busemeyer’s discussion of complementarity in either
quantum physics or psychology. It is, however, this individuality that allows us to bring quantum
physics and Q-L theories of human thinking closer, while still respecting the differences between
