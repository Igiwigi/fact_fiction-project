Turorem 16. A has non-zero discriminant over € if and only if it is semi-simple and separable.
Complementary Bases. Two bases 0), ...)%,, and 9), ...,4,, of A over f are said to be comp
mentary if T(w,;) = 6,;. These equations are equivalent to 6, = X20, T(6,w;) ; consequently th
are equivalent to (9.1), and to (9.2):
(9.1) For any fe A, f= 20; T(fo;).

(9.2) o;, = 20,T(w,0;) (t= 1,...,m).
These equations, in the form (9.2), imply that ZT (w,0;) T(8;4,) = T(w;,9,) = 9x, when
(9.3) D(04, «445 ym) «D (04; «++ 9m) = Va

Thus for the existence of complementary bases it is necessary that A have non-zero —
discriminant over f. When that condition is fulfilled, the unique basis complementary to
Wy «+3 W», is defined by (9.2). Assuming that these bases are in fact complementary, it i
seen from (9.1) that, in the regular representation determined by 4,,...,9,,, the matrix
representing f has elements T(fu,6,). It follows that T(f(w,9,+.-.+@n4,)) = T(B) for al
fe A; and hence, using (9.1) again,

(9.4) 0,6,+...+0,,6,, = 6

Differents. For any ae A, with characteristic polynomial f(x), the element éf’(«) is called —
the different of a, denoted by d(a).

The next theorem can easily be proved by the use of conjugates, in the case when A is
a field; but the theorem belongs more properly to the theory of algebras.
