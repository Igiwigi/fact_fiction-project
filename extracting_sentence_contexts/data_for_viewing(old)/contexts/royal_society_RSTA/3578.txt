behaviour at the yield point? Would it be economically viable to study
different types of steel apart from the carbon—manganese steel?

Vigdis Olden It would be a question of having the right material model, being able
to test the different types of ferritic materials you have and implement
their properties into the model, such as stress-strain curves or grain
sizes and orientations. So if you have a volume of micro-structure in
front of the crack it could be made representative of these properties.

Question 5

Adrian Sutton Ishare Eunan’s [McEniry] concern about what goes into a cohesive zone
model. I have always been very puzzled by the fact that engineers like
to put in a lot of plasticity on top of a purely atomistic process. If you
do a DFT calculation of cleavage of a plane in an ideal crystal without
hydrogen, take iron for example and cleave it on a (110) plane, you'll get
the energy as a function of the separation of that plane, and from that
you can calculate what the ideal cleavage stress will be and it will be a
sensible number, in the order of tens or hundreds of GPa. Then, if you
distribute some hydrogen on that plane it will reduce this ideal cleavage
energy by a factor of maybe two or ten, but that’s all the information
you need. There was a very important paper published in 1979 in Acta
Met. by McMahon and Vitek [10], in which they showed that the ideal
cleavage energy is like a tap: you only have to turn it a little bit and it
has a dramatic effect on the plasticity that then ensues as a result of that
