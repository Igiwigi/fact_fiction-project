THE BRANCHIAL ARTERIAL ARCHES IN BIRDS. 125

prolongation is from the dorsal end of the arch. It is large and always easily
followed. It is at first in direct continuity, upon each side, with the aortic root, but
afterwards this continuity is interfered with by the dwindling of that portion of the
stem which lies between the extremities of the third and fourth arches. The connec-
tion is finally completely broken through by the end of the seventh day. RatHKke
regarded this as the internal carotid, but it constitutes the sole blood-supply of the
head, and becomes the common carotid of the adult Bird, which is thus the persistent
third arch (see fig. 2, Plate 22) and its dorsal continuation forwards.

Confirmation of the fact just stated with regard to the common carotid artery is
found i in a remarkable abnormality which I met with in the dissection of a Guillemot
Uria troile), and which is represented in Plate 25, fig. 32. The remains of the

Blorsal connection between the third and fourth arches upon the right side are
| apeased as a distinct cord passing between the common carotid artery and the
vilescending portion of the aortic arch. The cord is connected with the carotid artery
Simmediately behind the origin of the vertebral branch. The other arteries were quite
Snormal. The only interference with the usual arrangement which the presence of this
Bord entailed was that the carotid artery of the right side reached the dorsal aspect
$f the oesophagus a little earlier than its fellow of the left side.
<7 If RaruxKerâ€™s theory be accepted, the presence of this cord remains unexplained.
SAccording to him, if the dorsal connection between the third and fourth arches were
