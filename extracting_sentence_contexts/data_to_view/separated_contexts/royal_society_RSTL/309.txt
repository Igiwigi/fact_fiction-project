SCHROETER's Observations

strong light of Venus must occasion a-much' greater degree of
glare, than the soft light of the moon in a much more rarified
atmosphere. In general it appears to me, that whoever will
bestow some attention on these observations, and compare them
impartially with the many others I have made on the atmo-
spheres of the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and even the sun, will
find a striking coincidence between them. The simple fact, that Venus in its different phases, and es-
pecially at the times of its greatest elongations, shews a much
greater diminution of light at its terminating border than the
moon, is, no doubt, sufficient to: point out a much denser at-
mosphere than that of this satellite. And this is, moreover,
fully evinced by the observations on its twilight. The circum-
stance also, that there are seen on this-planet none of the flat
spherical forms as are conspicuous on Jupiter and Saturn, none
of the stripes- or longitudinal spots parallel to- the equator;
which are seen- on these planets. and- the sun, and which point
out a certain stretch of atmosphere, gives room to infer, that
the globe of Venus, with reference to its diameter, and- other
circumstances of physical arrangement in its eonstruetion,*
performs its rotation round its axis in a- much longer space of
time than those planets, or the nearly similar ones of our earth:
and Mars ; and this is-actually confirmed by my observations
on the diurnal period of Venus.
