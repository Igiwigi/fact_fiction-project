obtained therefore corresponds to that represented in fig. 9 (GorDoN, 1926, b, p. 276),
and is already sufliciently advanced to enable one to determine the salient differences
between the early postlarval development of Echinarachnius parma and of Echinocardium
cordatum.

ANALYSIS OF THE PERMANENT SKELETON IN THE ADVANCED EcutnoriurEeus
AND IN THE Imago.

‘TH@EL (1892), in a large monograph on “ The Development of Echinocyamus pusillus,”
has described much of the development of the permanent skeleton in the echinopluteus.
Owing, doubtless, to the fact that the Clypeastroid larva is highly pigmented on the
left side, he did not succeed in analysing the skeleton of the imago. Since the early
development of the Clypeastroid skeleton is, in many respects, similar to that of a

ala.
