We have then some grounds for believing that possibly the leaves of Sayenopteris
Phillipsi var. cuneata were borne on plants of the genus Caytonia, while the leaves of
the ordinary form of S. Phillipsi belonged to the genus Gristhorpia.

Thus the results of the examination of the cuticle structure of the Sagenopteris leaves
provide further grounds for connecting them with the Caytoniales. We see that the
epidermal structure of their petioles matches closely that of the fruit stalks, both in
its dorsiventrality and in cell form and thickening. The structure of the fruit wall in
Gristhorpia is like that of the upper epidermis in the Sagenopteris lamina, though no
lamina has been found with a structure that can be closely compared with the epidermis
of Caytonia fruits. These points of resemblance may be coincidences, but when taken
with the facts of association they justify us in saying that not only is the connection
of Sagenopteris with the Caytoniales possible but probable.

Various arguments may be urged against this view and these may now be considered.

(a) On the grounds of the leaf shape and venation Sagenopteris is generally regarded as
allied to Marsilia and the Hydropteridee. Beyond these external features no further
comparison is possible. The structure of the epidermis in Marsilia quadrifoliata is
completely different. In specimens I have examined the recent leaflet shows almost the
same epidermal structure on both sides, both having stomata.* The stomata occur
above the veins and are not confined to the areas between them.

(b) Sagenopteris leaves have been found associated with structures which have an
