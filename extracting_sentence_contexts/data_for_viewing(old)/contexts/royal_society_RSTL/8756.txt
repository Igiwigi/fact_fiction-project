about the point cousidered; the force will depend on the form of this space; but it is not necessary for the
present purpose to decide what form it is most appropriate to assume.

are constants for the material, and A and B are constants dependent on the state of the
dielectric previous to insulation. It shonld be remarked that > does not depend alone
on the conductivity and specific inductive capacity, as ordinarily determined, of the
material, but also on the constants counecting polarization with electric force. Indeed if
the above view really represent the facts, the conductivity of a dielectric determined
from the steady flow of electricity through it measured by the galvanometer will differ
from that determined by the rate of loss of charge of the condenser when insulated.

2. A Florence flask nearly 4 inches in diameter was carefully cleansed, filled with
strong sulphuric acid, and immersed in water to the shoulder. Platinum wires were
dipped in the two fluids, and were also connected with the two principal electrodes of
the quadrant electrometer. The jar was slightly charged and insulated, and the poten-
tials read off from time to time. It was found (1) that even after twenty-four hours the
percentage of loss per hour continued to decrease, (2) that the potential could not be
expressed as a function of the time by two exponential terms. But the latter fact was
more clearly shown by the rate of development of the residual charge after different
periods of discharge, which put it beyond doubt that if the potential is properly expressed
