FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS OF AUSTRALIA. 29

is essentially the same* as in the Australian species ; whether a “ false stem ’’ existed
in these species or whether the stem was simple, as in the Osmundacew, can only be
shown by the discovery of more complete specimens. (iii) Geographical Distribution —One of the most interesting facts about C. australis
is its isolated geographical position, which extends the range of distribution, not only
of the genus but of the family Zygopteridew, far away into the southern hemisphere. FrIsTMANTEL’s} comprehensive work on the fossil flora of Eastern Australia, followed
by that of several recent authors, has proved the existence, in the Carboniferous rocks
of New South Wales, of a considerable flora showing clear affinities with European
types of a corresponding age. Similar evidence of a fundamental uniformity of the
earlier Carboniferous flora has gradually accumulated from several other directions
in the southern hemisphere.{
