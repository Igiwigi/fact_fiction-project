These
suggest that the 1923 and 1703 Kanto earthquakes shared the same source around the Miura
Peninsula (purple in figure 4a), but the 1703 earthquake source extended off the Boso Peninsula
(green in figure 4a). The ERC published the long-term forecast of the Kanto earthquakes in 2004 [41], in which
the Taisho-type and Genroku-type earthquakes were considered as two different ‘characteristic
earthquakes’. The Taisho-type source is located near the Miura Peninsula and is ruptured during
both types of Kanto earthquakes with an interval of 200-400 years, judging from the geodetic,
geomorphological and geological data as well as the fact that the interval between the 1703
and 1923 earthquake was 220 years. The Genroku-type earthquake involves rupture in another
source off the Boso Peninsula with a recurrence interval of 2300 years, which is based on the
ages of marine terrace in southern Boso Peninsula [39,40]. The 30-year probability based on the
BPT model was nearly zero for both types, because the time since the most recent event was
approximately 90 years and approximately 300 years, respectively.
