The
dashed horizontal line represents a population-level cap on group sizes
that is expected to occur due to population density. At very low population
densities, low-performance phenotypes may be unable to achieve group sizes
that would maximize their fitness.

(b) Leadership and group cohesion

The degree of physiological heterogeneity within groups
should impact the degree of coordination and cohesion that
a group displays. By definition, animals within the same
social group will engage in similar activity and foraging
levels and be exposed to comparable habitats and levels of
risk, despite the fact that individual animals vary greatly in
their behavioural tendencies (e.g. willingness to take risks)
and physiological requirements for energy [5,20,57]. To
function as a unit, individuals within a group must make
compromises, which deviate from their own preferred behav-
iours and settle on a collective common-ground. Couzin et al.
[113], for example, theoretically demonstrated that groups
opt for the average preferred action when differences
among individuals are small.
