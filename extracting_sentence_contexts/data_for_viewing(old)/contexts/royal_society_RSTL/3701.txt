or the attraction of the parts to which the method of the text applies is found by taking the sum of the heights
(4+H!), or the whole height from the sea-level up to the surface of the attracting mass. This, it will be
observed, is the ame whatever be the height of the station of observation. In fact, the horizontal attraction
of the mass, situated 80 far off as 50 miles and more, upon any station, even though in the mountains, cannot
differ in any appreciable degree from that upon the point where the yertical line at the station cuts the sea-
level below.
