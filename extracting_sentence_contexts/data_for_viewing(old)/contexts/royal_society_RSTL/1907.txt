does not in any case seem to be affected by the electric current. Palverised
charcoal was diffused through dilute sulphuric acid, and subjected with the
solution to the action of a voltaic battery, terminated by platina poles; but not
the slightest tendency of the charcoal to the negative pole could be observed.
Sublimed sulphur was diffused through similar acid, and submitted to the
same action, a silver plate being used as the negative pole; but the sulphur had
no tendency to pass to that pole, the silver was not tarnished, nor did any sul-
phuretted hydrogen appear. The case of magnesia and water (495. 533.), with
those of comminuted metals in certain solutions (546.), are also of this kind ;
and, in fact, snbstances which have the instant before been powerfully deter-
mined towards the pole, as magnesia from sulphate of magnesia, become en-
tirely indifferent to it the moment they assume their independent state, and
pass away, diffusing themselves in the surrounding fluid.

548. There are, it is true, many instances of insoluble bodies being acted
upon, as glass, sulphate of baryta, marble, slate, basalt, &c., but they form no
exception; for the substances they give up are in direct and strong relation
as to chemical affinity with those which they find in the surrounding solution,
s0 that these decompositions enter into the class of ordinary effects.

549. It may be expressed as a general consequence, that the more directly
bodies are opposed to each other in chemical affinity, the more ready is their
