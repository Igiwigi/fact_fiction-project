application is the design of quantum algorithms [5-8]. As an example, efficient search
algorithms [6,9,10] were devised exploiting the fact that the spread of a localized initial state
after t steps is proportional to t, whereas for the classical random walk the spread is proportional
to s/f. Remarkably, any quantum circuit can be implemented as a QW on a graph, proving that
QWs can be used for universal quantum computation [11].

Recently, in [12], the authors use QWs in a derivation of quantum field theory from principles,
from which it follows that the graph of the QW is the Cayley graph of a finitely presented group
G. The QWs reproducing free quantum field theory in Euclidean space correspond to group G=
Z# that is Abelian, which is the most common case in the literature. In particular, the simplest
QW descending from the principles is the Weyl QW [12], reproducing the Weyl quantum field
theory. The QW approach to quantum field theory has been successfully used in [12-20], where
non-interacting field theories are studied in a simplified picture in terms of QWs.
