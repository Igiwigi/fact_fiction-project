Smaller particles are believed to increase the water collection rate because of more nucleation
sites leading to a larger number of smaller droplets coalescing faster. Indeed, there was an increase
observed on the beetle-inspired surface, however, the superhydrophobic surface resulted in no
water collection at a 45° inclination. This is because of the fact that smaller particles nucleate
smaller droplets, as shown in the optical images, which could lead to losing droplets to the wind.
