However, these may require the used of additional devices, some of which may be
difficult to build using microfluidic techniques (Nauman et al. 2002). Microfluidics is a beautiful interplay between basic knowledge and technology. Basic knowledge suggests concepts for possible designs that, if realized, may led
to systems of technological importance and in turn produce new developments in
scienceâ€”many microfluidic devices are in fact scientific instruments. However, the
fact that something can be imagined does not mean that it can be built and, even if it
could, manufacturing dictates that this should be done inexpensively. The goal is to
