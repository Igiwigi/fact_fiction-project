In order to gain an understanding of the size of the two terms R,,, we can expand the

argument of the operator div~! in Fourier series in the fast variables, ‘with coefficients which 3!
depend on the slow variables. We illustrate this principle in the case of the second term: Dm

Ro = div™ [eg : Vey | =div! > cx(x, Heltah, (3.23) : ae
keZ3,k40 18

The coefficients c,(x, f) vary much slower than the rapidly oscillating exponentials and moreover : x
the coefficient co vanishes: this is in fact the content of condition (3.18). When we apply the [Ss
operator div-! we can therefore treat the cy, as constants and gain a factor 1/A,4; in the
outcome: a typically ‘stationary phase argument’. The conditions (3.18) and (3.19) ensure that

the same argument can be applied when dealing with RU. ve Equation (3.18) ensures that when the
differential operators hit the fast exponentials the resulting term vanishes, while (3.19) guarantees

that the Fourier expansion in the fast variables misses the zero frequency coefficient: (3.19)

encodes the high-high to low interaction with which the perturbation ‘cancels’ Ry.

Returning to (3.23) observe that:
