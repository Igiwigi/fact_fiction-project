As discussed above, So(tp) carries information not only on the
ZQC intensities resulting from correlated spins, but also polarization attributable to spins that
become decorrelated by decoherence and various non-idealities. Consequently, the experimental
data of ZQCs were excluded from the fittings at long evolution times. The fact that S,.¢(tp) decays,
indicates that not all the decorrelated spins are detected and therefore the contribution to ZQC is
partial. In order to evaluate the actual effectiveness of the time reversal procedure, we define the
zero-order difference (ZOD) as the distance between the experimental value and the fitted curve
evaluated in 1 = 0, Vtg. The LE incorporating the new definition is

Mme(tr) = Sie(tr) — ZOD(tp). (4.1)


This new definition of the LE is used to re-normalize the MQC curves, i.e.
