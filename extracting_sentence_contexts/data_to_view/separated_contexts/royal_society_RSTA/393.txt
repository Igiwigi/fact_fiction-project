The corrosive properties were
found to diminish as the chain length increases and also become very small above
caproic acid. It has been shown that, in the liquid state, alcohols and hydrocarbons are unable
to prevent stick-slips and do not afford much protection to the surfaces. Their be-
haviour is, in fact, essentially similar to that shown by mineral oils. The molecules of
these substances must therefore be attached to the surface comparatively weakly so
that the film of lubricant is easily broken down by the applied load. This view is
supported by the fact that the addition of a trace of cetyl alcohol was ineffective in
changing the nature of the sliding of a mineral oil.
