PROF. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 77

These bring all the lines (P (5), S (2), excepted as before) well within the limits of
error. Again, it is to be noted that in the 8 formula « = £, and the B of P is negligible.
The fact that this relation occurs twice suggests its being a real relation, and not due
to the chance choice of the suitable values of p, q, 7, &c. The limiting errors in the
eases of Rb and Cs are so wide that it did not seem worth while to discuss them in
the same detail, especially in view of considerations which will appear later, The
evidence so far is strengthened as to the correctness of (F) and (G) in fact; but, on
the other hand, the impression is intensified that there is something not quite correct
with the form for the S series. Rirz uses m+°5 instead of m, although there does
not seem any experimental evidenee in its favour. As a fact it can be shown that the
use of m+°5 in place of m in our formula makes it still more difficult to fulfil
conditions (F) and (G).

(H). The difference between the y's of S and P.—If we write down the value of
pot P—p of 8, we get
