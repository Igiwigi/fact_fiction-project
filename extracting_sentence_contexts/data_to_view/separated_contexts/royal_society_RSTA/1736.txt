These additional laser beamlines, based on OPCPA (Optical Parametric
Chirped Pulse Amplification) technology [132], are extremely useful for generating bright X-ray
sources [130] or protons beams [133] used, for example, to probe magnetized HED plasmas [134]. The plasma universe being magnetized and turbulent, one standing question remains as to
how to explain the level of the observed magnetic field in the interstellar and intracluster media
(ISM and ICM, respectively). In fact, the current strength of the magnetic fields exceeds by
many orders of magnitude their original seeds. Observations indicate that both the ISM and
the ICM are in a highly disturbed, turbulent state as a result of shocks and stirring by violent
astrophysical phenomena. Given this, the most widely invoked scenario for the generation of
cosmic magnetic fields is some form of turbulent dynamo [135]â€”a fast (exponential) amplification
of stochastic fields by the turbulent motions of the plasma.
