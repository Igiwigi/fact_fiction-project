Wrist.—In tabulating the movements of this joint, it was obviously necessary to
separate its two distinct functions, viz., pronation and supination, on the one hand,
and flexion and extension on the other. We will first discuss the latter function, as
by far the more important. On Table 3 it is seen how extremely constant is the
movement of extension, and a moment’s consideration will show that it is of funda-
mental importance, for it is clear that the delicate movements of the fingers could not
possibly be performed with any degree of accuracy and force unless the wrist be
previously fixed in moderate extension, and consideration of this fact also explains why
the wrist is especially provided with powerful extensor muscles which act with con-
siderable independence. (See fig. 4.)
