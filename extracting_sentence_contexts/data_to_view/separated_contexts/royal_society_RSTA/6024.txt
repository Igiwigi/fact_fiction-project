It
is worth stressing that identifying precisely k communities for large k is especially remarkable
considering our description of the network topology in the previous section. Indeed, for low B,
the graphs are essentially m-nearest-neighbours lattices for a wide range of k, so the difference
in the community structure is far less obvious than the top-left networks in figure 1. In fact,
when fed the unweighted networks (that is, with all the weights transformed as wij > O(Â«jj)),
the inferred community structure changes considerably, as can be seen from the blue curves in
figure 5a. The curves of number of detected communities 1, versus k show plateaus where n;, is
roughly constant, interrupted by dips that appear at the same values of k/N for which the average
degree changes abruptly (cf. figure 4a,b). Hence, we conclude that, in this regime, the community
structure is encoded in the dependence of the concurrence with respect to the position along the
chain.
