1626. When the production of heat is observed in electrolytes under decomposition,
the results are still more complicated. But important steps have been taken in the
investigation of this branch of the subject by Ds 1a Rive || and others; and it is more
than probable that, when the right limitations are applied, constant and definite re-
sults will here also be obtained.

1627. It is a most important part of the character of the current, and essentially
connected with its very nature, that it is always the same, The two forces are eyery-
where in it. There is neyer one current of force or one fluid only. Any one part
of the current may, as respects the presence of the two forces there, be considered
as precisely the same with any other part; and the numerous experiments which
imply their possible separation, as well as the theoretical expressions which, being
used daily, assume it, are, I think, in contradiction with facts (511, &c.). It appears
to me to be as impossi√æble to assume a current of positive or a current of negative
force alone, or of the two at once with any predominance of one oyer the other, as
it is to give an absolute charge to matter (1169. 1177.).

1628. The conviction of this truth, if, as I think, it be a truth, or on the other hand
the disproof of it, is of the greatest consequence. If, as a first principle, .we can
establish that the centres of the two forces, or elements of force, never can be sepa-
rated to any sensible distance, or at all events not further than the space between
two contiguous particles (1615.), or if we can establish the contrary conelusion,
how much more clear is our view of what lies before us, and how much less embar-
rassed the ground over which we have to pass in attaining to it, than if we remain
halting between two opinions! And if, with that feeling, we rigidly test every expe-
