In the later experiment, after about ten days, only some of the
leaves had a few outgrowths, some on the upper and some on the lower side (Â¢/.
pp. 170-172). But though light and heat are essential, it seems probable that, given the necessary
moisture in the atmosphere, the other two factors may be interdependent, viz., that
in a strong light outgrowths will form at a lower temperature, while in a poor light,
great warmth is required. That a certain minimum of light is required is proved by
the fact that outgrowths never form in darkness. Also, the minimum temperature
> at which assimilation will take place cannot be very low in a tropical plant like
Hibiscus. That direct sunlight of full intensity is not necessary is shown by the
formation of outgrowths under whitewashed glass, or in a warm shaded green-
house ; that it promotes their formation is suggested by their more rapid develop-
ment under the clear glass of a bell-jar.
