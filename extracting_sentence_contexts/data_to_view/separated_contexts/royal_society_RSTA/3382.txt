Here also, one sees that the chaotic region gets extended, holding for : >
larger values of ht as L increases. This region may disappear in the thermodynamic limit, or it may [a
reduce to a single critical point as in Anderson localization in higher dimensions, or yet it may 8
remain a finite region. What will in fact happen to the two transition regions, integrable-chaos : 3
and chaos-localization, for L > oo as well as the differences and similarities between the two are rad

open questions.

5. Conclusion

We analysed how the presence of level repulsion manifests itself in the dynamics of many-body
quantum systems. We showed that it appears in the form of a correlation hole in the long-time
evolution of the survival probability and as a minor bulge above the saturation values of the
Shannon and entanglement entropies.
