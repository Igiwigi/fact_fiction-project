It is therefore clear that in Lupinus albus an oscillating series of angles becomes
steady again much more easily than in spiral apices of Epilobium hirsutum. But it
would be premature to conclude that the apex of Lupinus albus possesses a special
regulating mechanism which brings the angles to a constant value. For it is quite
possible that, if the facts were more fully known, this difference between the two
species could be explained without any such assumptionâ€”perhaps in terms of some
such factors as the different shapes and relative sizes of their young leaves and apices. It would be interesting to know how often a constant series of divergence angles is
reached by the spiral adventitious buds of normally decussate species, such as those
observed by WerssE (1894). The question may also be raised whether the shoot apices of decussate species
have any peculiarity, not possessed by those of spiral species, which tends to keep
their phyllotaxis regularly decussate, provided that it is not too greatly disturbed.
