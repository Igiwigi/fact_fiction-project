The
theory of Htrmer (1922) also belongs to the first group. The second group of theories originated with Hormetsrerâ€™s observation that each
leaf arises in the largest gap between the previous leaves. To explain this fact he
suggested (1868) that the outgrowth of primordia produced a tension in the outer cell
walls, which tended to resist the outgrowth of further primordia. Each primordium,
therefore, arose in a position where the tension was at a minimum and thus came to
occupy the space that was farthest removed from the previous primordia. This theory
has received no further support, but the observation that leaves arise in the largest
gap has been accepted as a fundamental fact by several later writers.
