In small mammals, such as the rat, sperms reach the |
ovarian end of the uterus, according to Harrman and Batt (1930), in less than two
minutes after ejaculation. This very short period lends credence to LrucKkart’s state-
ment (1853, p. 919) that he and Biscnorr found guinea-pig sperms in the middle of the
tube of this animal a quarter of an hour after copulation. Notwithstanding the fact that rabbit sperms may live thirty-eight days in the male
ducts (HamMonD and AsDELL, 1926) and from seven to nine days in an environment
essentially external (IWANow, 1926; Wotr, 1921), their ability to fertilise, as already
stated, lasts after their entrance into the female tracts at most some thirty hours. Their
life in the exterior, even up to forty-nine hours and under conditions of transportation,
has been shown by Watron (1926) not to prevent their power to fertilise, though
YAMANE and Karo (1928) set some twenty-four hours as the extreme for such capacity. Hammonp (1930), however, has shown that rabbit sperm at 10° C. may retain the power
to fertilise for as much as ninety-six hours.
