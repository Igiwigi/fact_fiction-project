nearer together, although the exertion makes them more dis-
tinct, no doubt by contracting the pupil. The experiment with
the optometer was conducted, in the presence of Mr. Wart,
with patience and perseverance ; nor was any opinion given to
make her report partial.

Considering the difficulty of finding an eye perfectly suitable
for the experiments, these proofs may be deemed tolerably
satisfactory. But, since one positive argument will counter-
balance many negative ones, provided it be equally grounded
on fact, it becomes necessary to inquire into the competency of
the evidence employed to ascertain the power of accommoda-
tion attributed, in the Croonian Lecture for 1794, to the eye of
Benjamin CLERK. And it appears, that the distinction long
since very properly made by Dr. Juris, between distinct vision
and perfect vision, will readily explain away the whole of that
evidence.

It is obvious that vision may be made distinct to any given
extent, by means of an aperture sufficiently small, provided at
the same time, that a sufficient quantity of light be left, while
the refractive powers of the eye remain unchanged, And it is
remarkable, that in those experiments, when the comparison
