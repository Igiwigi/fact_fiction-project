It will be noticed that for the carbonate of lime the soluble sulphate is
demanded. We have shown throughout this paper that it is just in those beds in which we
get the evidence of marine conditions above the coal, presupposing the presence of
sea water, that we find the mineralised “ coal balls” in the seam. We may adapt the process suggested by the “Challenger” Reports and Stocks’
work, making the changes required to bring it into harmony with the facts our series
of analyses have revealed. From them we see that the part played by iron pyrites
is not so great as was supposed by Stocks, and that it may even be almost absent, as
in Analyses Nos. I, II, and TV in our Table I.
