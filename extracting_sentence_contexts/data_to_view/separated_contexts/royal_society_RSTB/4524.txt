IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS. 163

In conclusion, the intestinal Protozoa of Termites appear to afford an interesting
case of symbiosis. By their action in breaking down ligneous matter, they con-
tribute towards the digestion of the latter by their hosts. The contention that they
are parasites or solely coprozoic forms is not, in my opinion, equally in accordance
with the facts that are at present available. F. On Termites IN CaPpriviry.
