of multiple, quasi-orthonormal tapers reduces the variance in the estimates of both stationary and
non-stationary spectral estimates, because each taper is sensitive to different noise aspects [44].
This leads to more robust spectral estimates. ConceFT uses this concept but instead of a prescribed
averaging scheme of the multi-taper outputs, it generates multiple SST outcomes each with a
different random multi-taper weighting scheme, which subsequently are averaged. This reduces
the number of extracted instantaneous frequency components as well as any cross talk, thus
enhancing readability. Variants have been developed based on either multi-tapers combined with
the STFT, or the use of orthonormal mother wavelets using the CWT [32].

Figure 7 shows the application of ConceFT to the LIGO signal. The SST on which this ConceFT
representation is based is calculated using a Battle-Lemarié mother wavelet basis BL3 [30], and
20 realizations of the SST. A Morlet mother wavelet provides less clear results in this case. This
could be due to the fact that the ConceFT method is based on averaging semi-independent
SST outcomes; thus, orthogonality of the Battle-Lemarié mother wavelet helps reducing noise
