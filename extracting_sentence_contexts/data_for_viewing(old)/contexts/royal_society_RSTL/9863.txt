The formulas for 2(X*—Y?), —4X'Y” =1,'2Y'Z,2X'F4/ =1, 4+—Z* are found
symmetry, by merely accenting all the symbols in the five formulas (24-8) for :
M functions. In the use made of these formulas this accentuation will be deemed
be done. ; ;

At present we shall not regard x as being accented, but in $ 12 and in Part III. wo
shall have to regard y as also accented.

We now have to develop the several products of the X' fun
