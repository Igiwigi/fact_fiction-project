849. It is probable that all our present elementary bodies are tons, but that is not
as yet certain. There are some, such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, silicon, boron,
aluminm, the right of which to the title of ton it is desirable to decide as 800n as
possible. There are also many compound hodies, and amongst them alumina and
Silica, which it is desirable to class immediately by unexceptionable experiments.
It is also possible, that all combinable bodies, compound as well as simple, may enter
into the class of 7ons; but at present it does not seem to me probable. Still the expe-
rimental evidence I have is 80 small in proportion to what must gradually accumulate
around, and bear upon, this point, that Tam afraid to give a strong opinion upon it.

850. I think I cannot deceive myself in considering the doctrine of definite electro-
chemical action as of the utmost importance. It touches by its facts more directly
and closely than any former fact, or set of facts, have done, upon the beautiful idea,
that ordinary chemical affinity is a mere consequence of the electrical attractions of
the particles of different kinds of matter ; and it will probably lead us to the means by
which we may enlighten that which is at present s0 obscure, and either fully demon-
strate the truth of the idea, or develope that which ought to replace it.

851. A yery valuable use of electro-chemical equivalents will be to decide, in cases
of doubt, what is the true chemical equiyalent, or definite proportional, or atomic
number of a body ; for I have such conviction that the power which governs electro-
decomposition and ordinary chemical attractions is the same ; and such confidence in
the oyerruling influence of those natural laws which render the former definite, as to
