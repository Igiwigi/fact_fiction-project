Reversible transports of matter that are essential in hydrodynamics
are replaced by dissipative strictly irreversible diffusion processes. This is appealing, for example,
in the case of cellular systems the biochemistry of which is in many instances taking place under
strictly dissipative conditions like those met in open, isothermal reaction—diffusion systems. More fundamental and important for such biological systems is then the fact that the spatial
symmetry breaking phenomena observed in reaction-diffusion systems are intrinsic. On the
contrary, Bénard cells are extrinsic dissipative structures: their size is determined by external
environmental factor like boundary properties and the thickness of the fluid layer considered. The spatial wavelengths observed with chemical spatio-temporal dissipative structures are fixed
by expressions of the form \/D/k, where D has the dimensions of a diffusion coefficient and
k is the inverse of a time characteristic of the chemistry; in other words, these quantities are
specifically fixed by parameters that only depend on the irreversible processes taking place.
