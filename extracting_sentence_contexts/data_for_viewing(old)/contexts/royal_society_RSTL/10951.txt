for the cadmium lines given by the fixed electrode into the wave-lengths given above.

In the following tables the wave-lengths of a number of lines are compared with
measurements of previous observers. That these numbers agree in a very satisfactory
manner gives us some confidence in our method of working and in the probable
accuracy of the wave-lengths we have adopted for the cadmium lines, as derived from
our several measurements. With the exception of the lines 3402-9, 21964, and the
triple group 3260'2, 32518, 3249'5, our numbers agree well with those of M. Corxu,
but at these points the difference is considerable. We have carefully measured these
lines directly and we are inclined to consider our numbers correct. M. Corxu did
nob directly measure these lines, but derived the numbers he has given from a
comparison of his photographs with his map of the solar spectrum. But the reason
why the wave-lengths we have given are probably the more correct lies in the fact
that about this region there are many iron lines, and our measurements of iron agree
with those of M. Corxv, while, if our cadmium lines departed from accuracy as far as
they differ from those of M. Conxv, this difference would occur in the iron lines,
