Q

Sie. let K’ be the set of all points X, such that there are points X,, ..., X,, for which the point

OX = (X),..., X,) is in K. Let C be the closure of K’. It follows by repeated application of

2theorem 9 that C is a complex on some algebraic grating G, say. We prove that C is in fact

othe closure of the set of all primitively irreducible points X of S' with | X | >e.
