leads into a blind vessel running the length of the penis and another very small vessel which
leads anteriorly into the connective tissue of the oral cone among which it breaks up and
disappears.

The efferent system running from the cirri consists of a vessel running down the outer
convex side of each ramus. At the distal end of the basis the two vessels unite into a single
vessel on the outer side of the limb. This then enters the trunk and continues down its sides
as a definite tubular vessel running through a mass of connective tissue. At the level of the
ventral longitudinal muscles it gives off a branch which extends medianly to ramify and
disappear among the parenchyma occupying the spaces between these muscles. Only when
it reaches the dorso-lateral region of the trunk does it open into a sinus which runs forward
into the lower part of the prosoma. This represents the body cavity in which the dorsal
longitudinal muscles lie and the sinus in fact follows the course of these muscles. The sinuses
on either side do not join across underneath the dorsal side of the gut in the hinder part of
the trunk, as the gut parenchyma extends medially as far as the body wall and so forms a
barrier. In the prosomal region, however, the parenchyma only stretches to the mid-dorsal

body wall in separate strands or pillars and so the sinuses become confluent and form
simply a dorsal blood space (figure 12).

The dorsal prosomal blood space extends upwards between the pleats and the anterior
stomach wall into the median space which is the cavity of what I have called the blood
