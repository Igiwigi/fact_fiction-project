The conclusion to be drawn from these results is that the hyphal layer (not,
however, including the infection layer) in the nucellus of the matured grain is
ordinarily incapable of further germination, or else that the fungus is so closely
adapted to a parasitic life that its mycelium cannot be cultivated in artificial
media, as is well known to be the case with rusts and smuts. Of course, both of these
conditions may at once be true. The fact that the general hyphal layer in the grain
is of no further use in the infection of the embryo, the common failure of the hyphee
to penetrate into the endosperm through the aleurone layer, the comparatively rapid
disintegration of the hyphe under natural conditions (figs. 28-32), the irregular
staining reactions (fig. 33), the contortion and compression of the layer (fig. 28), and,
finally, the behaviour of the hyphz in the above-described culture experiments, all
