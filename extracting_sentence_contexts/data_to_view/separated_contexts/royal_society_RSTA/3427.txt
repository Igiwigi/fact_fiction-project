This inflation may arise due to the
subsurface Fe opacity peak. Moreover, bolometric luminosities during S Doradus eruptions are
not really constant [17], probably because energy from the radiation field is put into work that
must be done to inflate the envelope. Similarly, the idea that giant-eruption maxima are caused
by pseudo-photospheres in opaque super-Eddington winds is challenged by light-echo spectra
of n Carinae [21,22] (although see [23]), by detailed analysis of the ejecta around n Car that are
better matched by explosive models [24-26], and by the fact that many extragalactic giant LBV
eruptions are relatively hot at peak luminosity rather than cool [3,27,57]. Two more recent results create severe problems for the traditional view of LBVs: (i) some core-
collapse SNe (especially Type In) appear to have progenitors that have been identified as LBVs. This is prohibited in the standard view of LBVs as massive stars in transition to core He burning.
(ii) The environments of LBVs (and some SNe IIn) are remarkably isolated.
