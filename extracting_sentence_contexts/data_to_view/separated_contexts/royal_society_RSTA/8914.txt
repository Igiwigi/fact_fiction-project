It actually lay in the quite considerable pressure required between
the contacts for the whole of the heating current to pass. It was stated by Keyns and
Youne that if this difficulty of the large pressure required between the arm and the
contact screw could be overcome, the sensitivity of the temperature control would be
greatly increased. To accomplish this, and in view of the fact that the temperature
control had to be as good as possible for the present experiments, and also completely
automatic, the following arrangement was devised* :—As stated in the previous pages,
the arm of the control in the present cryostat moves between two contact screws. These are connected so that when the arm makes contact with either the one or the
other, a potential of + 12 volts or — 6 volts is applied to the grid of a triode valve. In
the plate circuit of the valve is a small electromagnetic contact breaker, which makes
or breaks the circuit of the heating current.
