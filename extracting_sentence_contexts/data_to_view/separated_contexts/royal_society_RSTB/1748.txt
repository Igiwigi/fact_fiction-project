The oldest fathers are: at 71 years three, and at 76 one. But the data respecting
the oldest fathers are to be accepted in general with still greater hesitation than
those of mothers. The doubtfulness of these data may be judged by the fact that
the reported fertility of the fathers above 66 is an increasing one! But Jet us add
that physiology admits conservation of male generative power till 80 years. The facts we have mentioned lead us to suppose that this power is not fully
developed before the age of 25.
