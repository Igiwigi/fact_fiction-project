is the shape parameter. The power law property is an important stylized fact that is prevalent
in real-world income distributions [30,31]. Other stylized facts that are recovered by the model
are larger yz (larger average population growth), larger o (more randomness in the dynamics)
and/ or smaller r (less retiring or layoffs), result in a smaller shape parameter and a heavier-tailed
distribution. This leads to higher inequality and lower mobility in the economy. Thus, srGBM is a
minimal model that is able to adequately represent a range of real word situations. As such it has
been implemented to date in various empirical studies (e.g. [5]).

Financial markets and economies usually display highly nonlinear dynamics. In srGBM, this
phenomenon is solely highlighted via the resetting rate. More complex generalizations of the
model that include nonlinearities in different manner are also potential avenues for income
dynamics. For instance, the Heston model is an ubiquitously implemented method for capturing
nonlinearities in the volatility [32-35] (see also the formulations and extensions considered in
[36,37]), whereas jump diffusion models have been applied to describe potential nonlinearities in
