which cannot be satisfied, since by hypothesis the three values of o': = are all different.
Hence the coefficients of the equation in question must separately vanish. In other
words, if a three-pointic contact subsist for three positions of the cutting plane about
an axis, it will subsist for all positions about that axis.

The s8ame law may obviously be extended to contacts of higher degrees.

The axis may be drawn, as before stated, in any direction throngh the point P ; it
may therefore be made to coincide with a tangent to the curve of intersection of U and
V at the point. But in that case it is obyious that two-pointic contact would subsist
for two positions (in fact for all positions) of the cutting plane without involving the
conditions for the ordinary contact of the two surfaces (viz. 3,V=0, 8,V=0, 3,V=0) as
a consequence. It is perhaps desirable to show that the formulz here employed take
cognizance of this circumstance, as well as of the corresponding circumstances in the
cases of contact of higher degrees. p

Suppose, then, that two-pointic contact subsists for two positions of the cutting plane
about the axis, say for the two planes (A, B, C, D), (A, By, C,, D,); then, adopting the
last form of the group (8), we have the two equations

Ad, V+Bd, V+ Ch, V=0,]
AdV+B3,V +C3,V=0.] *
Adding to these the two identical equations,
