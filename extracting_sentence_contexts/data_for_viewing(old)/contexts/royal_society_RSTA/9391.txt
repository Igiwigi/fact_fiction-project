Normal Reaction

Tomuinson’s theory of friction (XVIII) suggests that the reason for the difference in
magnitude between the tangential and normal reactions may be sought in the fact that
the former is the resistance to traction when the attractive and repulsive forces acting
across the surface of slip are in equilibrium with the load whilst the latter is the greatest
resistance offered by the attractive forces to a tension. This, however, would leave the
anomalous § value unaccounted for.


14 SIR WILLIAM HARDY ON PROBLEMS OF THE BOUNDARY STATE.

The fact that the sign of the effect of the number of carbon atoms in the chain is
different for T and N shows that the difference between them does not consist merely in
an extinction of the forces of repulsion. It might indeed be taken to mean that the
portion of the molecular field involved is different. This would explain why the sign is
the same for the viscosity _ of a fluid in mass as it is for the normal reaction, because
during flow, owing to the heat motions, the molecules must be presented in every spatial
way to the shearing stress.

The difference between the normal and tangential reactions appears in a new and
striking way when the adhesion and friction of lubricants composed of two pure chemical
substances are contrasted.

Consider a pair of miscible substances such that chemical action between them is
