The chief point emerging from such a comparison is the difference already alluded
to in the part played by the planum antorbitale in the bird and in the other forms. It may also be noticed that in the crocodile, the ramus lateralis nasi does not pass
through an epiphanial foramen, but that it would do so if the fusion between the
parietotectal and paranasal cartilages were slightly more extensive. The relations of
the nerve in the crocodile are really the same as in the lizard or the rabbit, and therefore
the fact that there is no epiphanial foramen in the duck is no evidence against the view
which we are here putting forward. The lachrymo-nasal duct (l.n.d.) is seen to be of little value for purposes of com-

parison, for whereas its junction with the nasal sac takes place behind the zona
annularis in the lizard, the crocodile and the duck, it takes place in front of the zona
annularis in the rabbit. There is, here, therefore, a discrepancy which does not amount
to much, and which places the mammal on a footing different from the others.
