of the strongest arguments for regarding these groups as nearly allied to erypto-
gamous ancestors. The leaf-traces of Lyginodendron become concentric in their
upward course, thus presenting an interesting parallel to those of the Osmundacese,
which are collateral mesarch in the stem and concentric in the petioles.

The occasional occurrence of concentric bundles in the stelar tube has already
been described in the case of the Osmundaceze. WILLIAMSON and Scorr (op. cit.,
Plate 23, fig. 8) mention a similar phenomenon in Lyginodendron oldhamium. I
have examined the original preparations in the British Museum. In these examples
there is internal phloem as well as internal secondary wood. Dr. Scorr considers
these features to be mere anomalies, but in view of the condition found in the Osmun-
dace they are probably to be regarded somewhat more seriously. This probability
is strengthened by the fact that in another species, Lyginodendron robustum, described
by Mr. Sewarp (‘ Ann. Bot.,’ vol. 11, p. 65), the presence of internal secondary wood
is quite constant. Cycadoxylon fremyt, another species close to Lyginodendron, has
also internal secondary xylem and phloem. In both the last-mentioned examples the
primary centripetal wood is largely abortive. Of less interest in this connection is a
monostelic genus Heterangium, which has secondary wood but no pith,

One of the most important genera of the Cycadofilices is Medullosa. In this genus
the fibro-vascular system is polystelic, 7.¢., made up of a number of anastomosing
concentric strands. It differs strikingly from the ferns, however, in the fact that its
“‘steles” are surrounded with secondary wood, and the primary wood is often largely
abortive, being replaced by parenchyma and constituting the so-called partial piths.
The concentric strands have a varying configuration. The external ones which, on
