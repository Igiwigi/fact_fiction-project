ought to be, and equally difficult to estimate what would be the actual value of d for
molten material similar to that of which our planets must have been composed when
in the molten state. Our argument is that the two values of d are at least of the
same order of magnitude, and probably equal, except for inaccuracies in our caleu-
lations.

Comparison of the Rotational and Gravitational Hypotheses.

$30. We may conclude this part of ow work by comparing two extreme
hypotheses: the first referring ‘the phenomena of planetary evolution solely to
rotational, and the second solely to gravitational instability.

Given the approximate values of 4 and p for a planet, and the fact that this

planet has thrown off a satellite, the former hypothesis leads to a certain inference as
to the angular momentum of the system; the latter to an inference as to the radius
of the primary. The former hypothesis leads to no inference at all as to the size of
planets which are to be expected—they are as likely to be of the size of billiard balls
as of the size of the planets of our system—while the latter leads to no inference as
to the angular momentum of the system, but presupposes it to be small. The
contention of the present paper is that the inferences which are drawn from the
former hypothesis are not borne out by observations on the planets of our system,
