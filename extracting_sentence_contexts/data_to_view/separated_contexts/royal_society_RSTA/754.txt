All calculations are performed with periodic supercells, with full structural relaxation,
including relaxation of the cell shape, unless otherwise stated. To achieve a desired convergence of
less than 0.1 meV per atom, necessary for the description of the hydrogen diffusion barriers in Fe,
Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids, with density of approximately 8000 kpts - atoms, are used. Owing
to the fact that hydrogen is extremely light, the zero-point vibrations of the H atom are taken
into account in the evaluation of the trapping energies; however, the variation of the zero-point
vibrational energy along diffusion paths, within the nudged-elastic band scheme, is neglected. In
some cases, the results are compared with ab initio values; these are obtained with the plane-wave
VASP package [26], using an equivalent k-point mesh, and an energy cut-off consistent with a
convergence of less than 0.1 meV per atom.

3. {110}-Terminated twist grain boundaries

Within an atomistic modelling framework, it is not feasible to screen all possible classes of grain
boundaries, from near-bulk Â£3-type boundaries to low-angle grain boundaries characterized
by periodic arrays of edge dislocations, while encompassing the whole range of twist and tilt
boundaries. It is the view of the authors that a more systematic approach can be achieved by
considering a particular class of boundaries, which can be well characterized by a particular order
parameter, and then to examine properties of the boundaries as a function of that parameter.
