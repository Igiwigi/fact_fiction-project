The faces of leaves following biosolids or waste water application,
anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine, for example, can persist thus potentially exposing herbivores to associated contami-

crop plants, accumulating particularly into leaves [36]. Simi- sediments is complicated by the fact that many compounds

Prozac) excreted by humans is only partially metabolized, to negatively charged clay particles [35,36]. Nevertheless,
incompletely removed by current wastewater treatment some pharmaceuticals might still be available to soil- or
plant (WWTP) processes, and exhibits minimal degradation sediment-ingesting organisms and could potentially accumu-
or transformation in sewage or soil over many months late in terrestrial and benthic food webs (reviewed by Shore
