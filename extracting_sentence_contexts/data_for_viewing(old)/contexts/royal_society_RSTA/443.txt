of the knowledge is non-negative.

Let C(z), z > 0, denote the probability distribution of knowledge of the (fixed) background. It
is reasonable to assume that C(z) has a bounded mean, so that

| C(z)dz=1 and | zC(z)dz=M. (2.2)

We note that the distribution of the background will induce a certain policy of acquisition of
knowledge. For example, let us assume that the background is a random variable uniformly
distributed on the interval (0,a), where a> 0 is a fixed constant. If we choose for simplicity
(x) = Ap(x) =4, and the individual has a degree of knowledge x > a, in the absence of randomness
the interaction will always produce a value x* < x, namely a partial decrease of knowledge. In this
case, in fact, the process of selection in an individual with high knowledge cannot be restored by
interaction with the environment.

The study of the time evolution of the distribution of knowledge consequent to interactions
of type (2.1) among individuals can be obtained by resorting to linear kinetic collision-like
models [45,46] like the ones previously used in the context of opinion dynamics. Let F = F(x, t)
be the density of agents which at time f > 0 are represented by their knowledge x € R+. Then, the
time evolution of F(x, t) obeys a Boltzmann-like equation. This equation can be fruitfully written
in weak form. It corresponds to saying that the solution F(x, f) satisfies, for all smooth functions
¢(x) (the observable quantities),

. | F(x, thp(x) dx = (| ; (y(x*) — v(x))F(x, t)C(z) dx a} (2.3)
