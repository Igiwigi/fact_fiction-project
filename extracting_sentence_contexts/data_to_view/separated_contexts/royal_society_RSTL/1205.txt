The alkalies produced were apparently dry, or at least
contained no more moisture than might well be conceived
to exist in the oxygene gas absorbed ; and their weights
considerably exceeded those of the combustible matters
consumed. The processes on which these conclusions are founded
will be fully described hereafter, when the minute details
which are necessary will be explained, and the proportions
of oxygene, and of the respective inflammable substances
which enter into union to form the fixed alkalies, will be
given. It appears then, that in these facts there is the same evidence
for the decomposition of potash and soda into oxygene and
two peculiar substances, as there is for the decomposition of
sulphuric and phosphoric acids and the metallic oxides into
oxygene and their respective combustible bases. In the analytical experiments, no substances capable of
decomposition are present but the alkalies and a minute

portion of moisture ; which seems in no other way essential
to the result, than in rendering them conductors at the
surface : for the new substances are not generated till the inte-
rior, which is dry, begins to be fused; they explode when in
rising through the fused alkali they come in contact with the
heated moistened surface ; they cannot be produced from
crystallized alkalies, which contain much water; and the
effect produced by the electrization of ignited potash, which
contains no sensible quantity of water, confirms the opinion
of their formation independently of the presence of this
gubstance. The combustible bases of the fixed alkalies seem to be
repelled as other combustible substances, by positively elec-
trified surfaces, and attracted by negatively electrified sur-
faces, and the oxygene follows the contrary order ;* or the
oxygene being naturally possessed of the negative energy,
and the bases of the positive, do not remain in combination
when either of them is brought into an electrical state
opposite to its natural one.” In the synthesis, on the contrary,
the natural energies or attractions come. in equilibrium with
each other ; and when these are in a low state at common
temperatures, a slow combination is effected ; but when they
are exalted by heat, a rapid union is the result ; and as in other
like cases with the production of fire.—A number of circum-
stances relating to the agencies of the bases of the alkalies will
be immediately stated, and will be found to offer confirma-
tions of these general conclusions.
