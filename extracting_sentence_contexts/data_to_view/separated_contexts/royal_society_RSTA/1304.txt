Eliminating the modified time x; by means of expression (4.7) (see also figure 8b), we
demonstrate in figure 10 the dimensionless supercooling and distribution function depending
on real dimensionless variables t and z;. As can be easily seen from figure 10a, supercooling is
removed faster in the case of the growth of ellipsoidal crystals in comparison with the evolution
of spherical particles. As in the previous section, this is explained by the fact that ellipsoidal
particles (of the same volume as spherical particles) have a larger surface area and, therefore,
they release the larger latent heat of crystallization, which leads to faster removal of supercooling. This circumstance directly affects the distribution function shown in figure 10b at a fixed time t. As is easily seen, the distribution function for ellipsoidal particles is lower and shifted to larger
volumes Z; of crystals.
