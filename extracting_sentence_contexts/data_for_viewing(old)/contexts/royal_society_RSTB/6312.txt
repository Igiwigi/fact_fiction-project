One first year stoat only, a large animal weighing 244 gm killed on July 31,
showed any traces of pregnancy ; the uterus was not large, 0-06 gm, but the uterine
mucosa was very similar to that of a post-partum animal, in which the endometrial
glands were only just reforming after the repair of the epithelium and the disappear-
ance of the debris of pregnancy. From the slight development of the uterine muscle,
however, and the absence of pigment, this animal might have recovered and ovulated
following an abortive pregnancy rather than a full term one. No mammary gland
development was observed. In view of the numbers of animals examined it is doubt-
ful if this anomalous specimen has any significance.

To summarize, the stoat reproductive cycle shows at least two interesting features,
the first being the fact that whereas the male has a complete anoestrus, the female
can apparently ovulate at all times of the year, and the second being the frequent
occurrence in both mated and unmated animals of infertile reproductive cycles.
Such apparent inefficiency in breeding seems to be commoner in wild species than
would be expected. Hedgehogs show infertile reproductive cycles in both mated and
unmated animals (DEANEsLy, 1934), and there is also clear evidence of infertile cycles

in Evotomys, the bank vole (BRAMBELL : unpublished information). On the other
hand, in the grey squirrel (DEANEsLy and Parkes, 1933), and in the shrew (BRaM-
BELL, 1935) ovulation seems to be followed almost invariably by pregnancy, and this
