Using this integral, the second equation becomes (on the elimination of 27—m—n)

Combining this with the first equation, we have

d a—2h+b
qa (U— 2h + b) + ae -= 0,

so that, as p + 1 = 0, we have

Ba y+e2 ats

Since p + 1 = 0 implies that z + a is a function of y, we infer that

z+ = arb. fn. of y;

and consequently an integral that can be associated with the original equation is
given by

Taking next the case p=q, the alternative that arises out of the characteristic
equation, we have the three other equations the same as before. It is now necessary
to take account of the three equations of identity, which, when the relation p = q is
used, are of the form

dh da _ dq dg

so that, eliminating the terms in p from the three equations, we have
