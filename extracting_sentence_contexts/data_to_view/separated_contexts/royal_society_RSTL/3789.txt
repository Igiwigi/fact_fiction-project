From the number of specimens I have met with in which this is the case,
I have been enabled to arrive at the conclnsion, that although reproduced limbs in
these animals may ultimately attain the full size of the normal structures, they never
acquire a perfectly normal development of all their parts, which are sometimes super-
numerary, but more frequently are deficient in number, and are almost invariably
atrophied. This is strikingly illustrated in the development of the spines with
which the basal joints of the posterior legs of the Scolopendre are armed. This fact is
of consequence in a Zoological point of view; as these parts have recently been much
depended on in the determination of species. It is also, perhaps, of 'some valne in
relation to the laws of development, since it is found to be equally constant, as I shall
presently show, in the reproduced parts of the true Insecta.

Insecta. Some experiments formerly made by Dr. HzixgkE* on the Blatte, have already
shown that these insects, which do not undergo any metamorphosis but a change of
tegument, have a power of reproducing the antennz in their young state.
