of ferns occupying an intermediate position in the phyletic series (Bower 1923). It is also
recognized as being a transitional stage in the ontogeny of ferns possessing more elaborate
stelar arrangements, i.e. it occurs between the protostelic stage and the dictyostelic stage.
According to the Theory of Recapitulation, the historical development of vascular structure
in dictyostelic ferns is reflected in the protostelic and solenostelic stages to be observed in
the young plant. The vascular system has been regarded by morphologists as being highly
conservative in its nature and therefore, of all the criteria of comparison, of greatest value
in phyletic studies (Bower 1923). But Bower (1921, 1930) has also indicated that there are
other ways of looking at the facts of stelar development, e.g. that the change from the
protostelic to the solenostelic condition may be a necessary consequence of increase in size,
and that the ‘size factor’, in conjunction with other factors, is causally related to the further
transition from solenostely to dictyostely and polycycly. From such views it becomes
evident that if structural complexity can be referred to causal factors, it necessarily loses
value in phylesis. Ferns characterized by solenostelic structure, for example, are not
necessarily closely related; nor does the dictyostelic condition necessarily indicate a higher
evolutionary development than the solenostelic or protostelic conditions.

The evidence presented here shows that a solenostelic vascular system may not only be
derived from a protostele, as in the normal development, but that it can also result, under
certain conditions, from the further development of an undifferentiated meristele. From
this it may be inferred that solenostely should not simply be regarded as an inevitable
