A graph of the function (e~*"— 1) ei” for
different values of tis given by Lamb (1932, p. 623) to illustrate the motion in the neighbour-
hood of a plane boundary when the fluid at infinity is oscillating harmonically. Equation
(174) shows that in the first approximation the boundary may be regarded as plane and

. g? and V,, as independent of s as well as n. However, the fact that these velocities are

not completely independent of s produces a small normal velocity relative to the boundary,
given by

a Ls £ (V1) me (4 — 42+ ila 1). (175)

Just beyond the boundary layer this velocity is given by

In considering the second-order terms a development of the notation will be useful. If F, and F, are any two periodic quantities of the form
