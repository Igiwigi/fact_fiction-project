Group “ D” contains forged bars similar to those in group “ C,” though generally

No. 39/D.12 was, in fact, specially noticeable for the excellent mirror polish which it
possessed, in no way diminished after this lapse of time. The specimen originally selected from the contents of the box for a preliminary
examination, prior to the investigation of the remaining 78, comes into this category
“DP.” Like No. 39/D.12 it had, in fact, a high mirror polish on one side, and was
also closely similar in its cross-sectional dimensions. For this reason it was allocated
the author’s Research number 39), and group number D.12.
