The composition of specimens of Group F, described as ‘* Crude Steel from the Blast
Furnace,” is interesting but somewhat puzzling. The very high sulphur content of
approximately 2 per cent. and specially high carbon would, however, seem to confirm
that, unlike the remaining steels, they have been melted direct in Farapay’s blast
furnace.

The red-shortness which was to be anticipated in such material was confirmed by
the author, an attempt being made to forge a small piece from a corner of specimen
No. 68/F.2 but without success, that is, the material easily burst.

Silver Steels.—It will be noted that the proportion of silver in such specimens as
contain this element never exceeds 0-46 per cent. This fact finds its explanation in the
very limited solubility of silver in steel, as well shown later in the microstructure of
specimen No. 12/C.1-1. Here the silver is found as a distinct micro-constituent. It will
thus be readily understood also why duplicate determinations of the silver content in
this specimen showed different amounts.

This same fact did not escape the observant Farapay, who, in his joint paper with
Sroparv in the “ Quarterly Journal of Science,” published in 1820, mentioned that when
a mixture of silver and steel was kept long in a molten state, a perfect alloy seemed to
be formed : but on solidification, globules of silver appeared on the surface of the button.
When a forged bar of this metal was acted on by dilute sulphuric acid, the silver was
left in threads through the mass, “ so that the whole has the appearance of a bundle of
fibres of silver and steel as if they had been united by welding.”
