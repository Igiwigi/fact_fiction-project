In addition, SA has a pKa as low as 3 even in strong acidic media, and thus it can
be expected that it will be dissociated into Na* and the negative alginate ion in the Alg + Chi
sample, whereas chitosan has an ample number of amino groups (pKa around 6.5) that tend to
remain protonated at acidic and neutral pH [14]. As a result, in the mildly acidic conditions of the
Alg +Chi sample, electrostatic attraction between alginate and chitosan molecules is expected. This fact justifies the one order of magnitude larger values of shear stress and viscosity for
Alg + Chi sample with respect to Alg sample despite the similar total concentration of polymers. This electrostatic attraction between alginate and chitosan can be better induced from the analysis
of the viscoelasticity of the samples (figure 1c,4). As observed, the Alg sample demonstrated the
liquid-like behaviour typical of polymer solutions, characterized by values of the loss modulus
(G”) larger than those of the storage modulus (G’) and dependence of both moduli to increase
linearly with frequency in a double logarithmic plot (figure 1d) [15].
