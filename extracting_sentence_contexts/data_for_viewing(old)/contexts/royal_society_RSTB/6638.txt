The head skeleton of Acanthodes bronnii was described by O. M. Res in a series of
papers, of which the latest and most important are two published in 1895 and 1896.
One of them (1895) consists of a series of plates containing admirable and, in the only
case in which I have made direct comparison with the original, scrupulously accurate
drawings of the head. The other (1896) contains a detailed description and discussion

of the morphology of the whole skeleton. This paper has never received the attention
that it deserves because it is exceedingly difficult to follow without actual material at
hand, and it contains one or two suggestions which cannot be supported; but it is in
general, so far as I can claim to understand it, accurate as to its facts, as distinguished
from the interpretation sometimes placed on them. The only two authors who seem
seriously to have considered Rets’s papers are JAEKEL and BAsnrorp Dean. The former
made a series of magnificent preparations of the material of Acanthodes bronnii in Berlin
and elsewhere, but never gave a connected account of the structure which they
showed, contenting himself with partial drawings and descriptions scattered through-
out papers dealing with very different subjects over a period of a quarter of a century,
and indulging in occasional polemics with Reis. Professor BasHrorp DEAN (1907)
examined some of Professor JAEKEL’s material and gave, in a short paper in the
American Journal of Anatomy, a discussion of certain parts of the anatomy of “‘ Acantho-
dian sharks” which contained many important observations and criticisms of the.
views of Reis, JAEKEL and SmirH Woopwarb, together with some admirable draw-
ings illustrating anatomical details.
