On the other
hand, on all ordinary nights, a variety of details are shown by the great instrument
which were not seen on the finest nights with the smaller instrament. There is
another fact I may perhaps add, that while high magnifying power brings out minute
stars it extinguishes faint nebulosity. The optical reason is obvious ; but in sketching
the dumb-bell nebula in 1845 that fact was overlooked, and but one eye-piece was
used, a very high one; had there been a low one also used the sketch would have
been more complete. To return to the annular nebule. The five planetary nebulz
we have ascertained to be annular, are as follows : 464, Plate XXXVIII. fig. 12, has
two stars within it; 2075 has one star a little following the centre; 2241, Plate
XXXVIII. fig. 13, has no star, but is surrounded with a faint external annulus ;
2050 has a perforation not round nor quite symmetrical with the star ; 838, Plate
XXXVII. fig. 11, has two stars and two perforations.
