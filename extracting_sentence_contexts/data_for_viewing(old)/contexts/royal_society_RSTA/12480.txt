the total resistance at 440°9 from 11°5678 to 11°4616 ohms would account for the
difference between pt, and pt.

From Evererr’s ‘ Physical Constants,’ I extract the following numbers :—

Specific resistance of glass at 200°C. = 2230000 x 10!
» » » 800° = 14500 x 10”
” Ms ” 2002) = 7210 * 10%

Assuming these numbers, the above fall in the resistance would be accounted for on
the supposition that the total resistance of the glass at 200° did not exceed about
6 X 10° ohms, which, bearing in mind the large section, is not an impossible number.
This explanation is borne out by the fact that Curve D is the steepest, showing
the greatest falling off in the increase of resistance. In D the section of the
glass conductor was much greater than in any of the others, the wire being in close
contact with glass on both sides throughout the whole length of nine feet. Again,
slight differences in the quality of the glass, or in the nature of the contact between it
and the platinum would be sufficient (on this hypothesis) to account for the differences
between the curves.

It is, however, conclusively shown by the experimental results that, whatever is the
cause of the discrepancy, it does not affect the determinations of temperature made by
these thermometers.
