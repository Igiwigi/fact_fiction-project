In this sitnation their readings were found to be inter-
mediate as before, but that which was exposed to three-fourths of the sky, read most
nearly to that on the grass fully exposed to the sky, and the one which was exposed to
one-fourth part of the sky only, read most nearly to that in air. The amount of these
differences of readings was as nearly as could be determined exactly proportional to
the amount of the exposed sky. Hence, as a general fact it may be considered, that whatever diminishes the view
of the sky as seen from an exposed body, causes its temperature to decrease less
than it would if the exposure to the sky be complete. Various experiments were made to ascertain the effect of covering plants at night
by matting, or other thin substances; and it was always found that when the protect-
ing substances touched the plant, much heat was conducted away from it, and such
plant was at a lower temperature than when the substance was merely interposed
between it and the sky ; the thinnest substance thus interposed, at any distance from
the plant, was found to be effectual in preventing the loss of its heat by radiation. It was found, however, that when a plant was thus itself protected, but yet was ex-
posed to any body which was exposed to the sky, more heat radiated from the former
to the latter, than from the exposed body to the plant, and thus it lost some heat.

'The several thermometers at the different distances from the earth were for some
time read at short intervals during the night and day, and it was found that except
after noon, the reading of the thermometer at twelve feet from the earth was very
nearly identical with the true temperature of the air,

The bulb of the thermometer thus exposed to the full rays of the sun was situated
nine inches west of the plank which carried it, and whose width was three inches ;
and the cause of its readings being about 1* too high during the afternoon, was
owing to the heat reflected from the plank to it.
