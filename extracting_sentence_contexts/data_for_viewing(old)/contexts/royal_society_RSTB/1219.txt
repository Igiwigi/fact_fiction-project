cells the effect of a single sexual process is distributed over the parts p;
these parts, when isolated, may be styled the spores, or, to distinguish th
other unicellular organs of propagation, they are designated by the spec
“ carpospores.” Further comparison of living forms leads to the conclusion th
followed upon the increasing size of the sporophyte a progressive sterilizatio
tissues, so that only a part of those tissues continued to be sporogenous; this:
most readily illustrated by reference to the Bryophyta (see below, p. 485, &e.),a
plants in which progressive sterilization of the tissues of the sporophyte app
have been closely connected with its increasing size and structural complexi
series is, however, characterized by the simple external form of the sporoph
by the further fact that the sporogenous tissue of each individual sporop
normally a continuous mass ; accordingly, the recognition of the progressive st
tion is in them comparatively easy.
Progressive sterilization seems also to have played an important part in the
tion of the Vascular Cryptogams; in these, as we see them at the prese
the proportion of sporogenous tissue to vegetative tissue is comparatively sm
sporogenous cells are commonly separated into small masses, or are distributed
in fact, the sterilization appears to have progressed much further in the Vi
Cryptogams than in the Bryophyta; the external form, also, is much more ¢
owing to the presence of appendicular organs. But though it may be more
to trace the steps of sterilization in the living Vascular Cryptogams, o
process having been more completely carried out, the experience gained from st
the Algee and Bryophyta should direct the line of observation into this chann
