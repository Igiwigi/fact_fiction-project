These experiments too oppose another statement relative to
a method prescribed for making fluoric acid gas free from silex,
by merely heating strong subsilicated fluoric acid in a retort,
and collecting the gas over mercury. It is asserted, in chemi-
cal works of some reputation, that this process is successful.
I have never found it s0, having always obtained results similar
to' those above stated. This, I suppose, is one of the many
errors that have secretly crept into repute, and has been be-
lieved, because never subjected to the test of experiment.

The action of concentrated sulphuric acid on subsilicated
fluoric acid, is similar to that of muriatic acid gas, occasioning
a disengagement of silicated fluoric acid. gas. Facts which
appear to prove, that water is absolutely essential to the exist-
ence of this acid.

Boracic acid decomposes it, in a very different way, not from
any predominant affinity for the water, but in consequence of
a stronger attraction for the fluoric acid itself. Silicated fluoric
acid of course is not produced ; but liquid fluoboracic acid and
the silex is precipitated in a gelatinous state, as when ammonia
is employed.

Thezse are the principal facts I have to notice respecting this
acid. Before I conclude, I shall briefly mention a few other
