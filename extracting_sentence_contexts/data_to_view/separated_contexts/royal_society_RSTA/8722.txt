Cass. is a
star of type B3, with a temperature, say, twice that of the sun. Consequently the
darkening in 24560 is to be expected to follow the same law as that for 19120 in the
sun; 29120 shows in the sun considerably less darkening than 14560, according to
Assor the limb-intensity in 14560 being about 0-25 of the central and that in 29120
about 0-55 of the central. It should be mentioned that the actual darkening found
by Sreseis is much less even than this; in fact, he found no evidence of darkening
at all. But this could equally well be interpreted to mean that the star had an
exceptionally high temperature. It does not appear to have been previously considered that there should be an
intimate relation between the law of darkening of a star and the distribution of energy
in its continuous spectrum.
