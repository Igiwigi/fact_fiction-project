stem at Autun having a similar triangular axis, and which he also had referred to
Sphenophyllum (* Comptes Rendus,” 1870), My attention was at once directed to the
discovery of true stems having a similar structure, and I s0on found a few examples in
the cabinets of Messrs. BuTrERwoRTH and WHrTAkER of Oldham. But these gave me
no such evidence as I required respecting the nature of the foliage with which these
stems had been clothed, neither did any of them afford proof even that the plant
had been a jointed one. I then turned to the coal-seam from which the fossil strobilus
was obtained, and was at length rewarded by the discovery of a cluster of stems, each
one of which was clothed with its peculiar bark, having the enlarged lenticular nodes
exquisitely preserved, and the yerticils of Asterophyllite-leaves radiating from the thin
margin of each nodal disk in precisely the same way as the bracts had.done from the
corresponding portions of the fruit already described. What had previously been an
inferred probability thus became an established fact; hence I have now no hesitation
whateyer in referring both the aboye fruit and the stems which I am about to describe
to the genus Asterophyllites. Amongst the other specimens sent to me from Burntis-

size than any I had met with in Lancashire; but, though exquisitely preserved, the
fragments were internodal ones, and not sufficiently long to exhibit the structure of
