If, indeed, the contact theory assume contact as the efficient
cause of yoltaic action, but admit that this can only be circulated by chemical action,
I xee little difference, save in the mere hypothetical expression, between the contact
and chemical theories; any conclusion which would flow from the one would like-
wise be deducible from the other; there is no observed sequence of time in the phe-
nomena, the contact or completion of the circuit and the electrolytical action are
synchronous. If this be the view of contact theorists, the rival theories are mere
disputes about terms. If, however, the contact theory connects with the term con-
tact an idea of force which does or may produce a voltaic current independently of
chemical action, a force without consumption, I cannot but regard it as inconsist-
ent with the whole tenor of voltaic facts and genera] experience.”

24, I $hall have occasion to revert to the gas battery, the action of which is fully
described in the paper from which I have taken the preceding quotation; but the
action we are now examining is not that arising from contact or completion of the
circuit, but that which is caused by contact in the arrangement of a progressive
