Today, owing to an extensive experimental and
theoretical effort, the state of affairs has reached a historically unique level of harmony,
although there still remains many things to sort out. Keywords: recombination; dissociation; Jahn—Teller; electron capture

1. Introduction

This 10 years retrospective on the dissociative recombination of Hy is of course
related to the fact that the first Royal Society Discussion Meeting (RSDM) on H}
was held in the year 2000, i.e. just over 10 years ago. At that time, which is very
clear from a reading of my summary of the situation concerning experimental
and, to some extent, theoretical studies of the dissociative recombination of
Hy [1], the situation was bewildering. The reaction itself appears, naively,

to be very simple:
H} +e >H+H+Hor Hy) +H. (1.1)

Only three protons and three electrons, of which one electron is free before
the reaction and all electrons are bound after the reaction, at the expense of
a complete or partial break-up of a stable molecular ion.
