Such a culture is depicted in Plate 16,
fig. 6. Owing to the fact that all the bronchi of adult lung (excepting, of course, the terminal
bronchioles) are ciliated, whereas in foetal lung only the largest bronchi are ciliated, the
degree of “ dedifferentiation ” of the bronchial and cicatricial epithelia in adult lung is
greater than in foetal lung. The ciliated columnar epithelial cell is obviously more
highly specialized, in structure and in function, than its non-ciliated rather cubical
