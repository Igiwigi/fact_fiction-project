In general, the experimental comparison of the three relations in the case of gases at
normal densities is not so easily made as it is in the case of liquids, although a consider-
able amount of research has been devoted to the subject owing to the ease with which
the density of a gas may be varied by alterations of temperature and pressure. ‘The
reason for this difficulty is that the refractivity of gases at normal densities is small,
and the first and third relations quoted above therefore reduce, as a first approxi-
mation, very closely to the same simple form as the second, as has been shown by
Lorentz (1936, 2, 88).

(d) Temperature-pressure relations affecting the refractivity and density of gases. A direct
consequence of the close proportionality between refractivity and density in the case of
gases, even at moderately high densities, is that variations of refractivity with tem-
perature and pressure should closely correspond with those of density under the same
influences. In fact, the departures of gases from the well-known laws of a perfect gas
may very well be investigated by refractivity measurements, as will be indicated later
in this paper.
