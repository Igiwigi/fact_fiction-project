(= 2424 lbs.). It is true that
when excessive amounts of farm-yard manure are applied there will probably be some
loss by the evolution of free nitrogen, but here the estimated losses amounted to much

crops. Indeed, M. Den√©ratn calls attention to the fact that, according to the
figures, one-fourth of the total nitrogen of the surface soil has been lost !_ We repeat
that such losses certainly do not occur in practical agriculture. But, if such loss could
