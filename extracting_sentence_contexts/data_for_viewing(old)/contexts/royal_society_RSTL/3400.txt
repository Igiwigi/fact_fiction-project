loss of the zincode exactly equal.

Hence it appears that the law of the electrolysis of the bi-salt is very different from
that of the neutral salt : the solution conducted very well, but as estimated by the
potassa transferred to the platinode, not more than one fifth of an equivalent was de-
composed for an equivalent of hydrogen evolved at the same electrode. This was
accompanied by the transfer of half an equiyalent of acid to the zincode, where a
whole equivalent of oxygen was also given off.

I think that we cannot hesitate to admit that, in this case, the current divided
itself between two electrolytes, and that a part was conducted by the neutral sulphate
of potassa, and a larger part by the sulphuric acid and water, after the manner of the
solutions upon which we have dwelt s0 long. It is a well known fact that the voltaic
current will divide itself between two or more metallic conductors in inverse propor-
tion to the resistance which each may offer to its course ; and that it does not in such
cases choose alone the path of least resistance ; and, in a former communication *
to you, I pointed out some curious instances of diverted currents in which liquid elec-
trolytes were concerned. I am not aware that such a division of a current between
two electrolytes in the same solution has ever before been pointed out, but analogy
would lead one to expect it.

With this new view let us now revert first to the experiments with the dilute sul-
phuric acid. If we regard this acid as a mixture of the two electrolytes, oxisulphion
