chlorate may for practical purposes be considered to have the same in view of the close
approximation in value of two of the principal susceptibilities. In Table II are collected
together the differences in susceptibility of these crystals, along, and perpendicular to,
their axes of symmetry. The last column in the table gives the differences between
the principal gram molecular refractivities (defined as usual by R= M (n?—1)/(n®+-2) ).

In striking contrast with these values are those for the sulphates which are given in
Table IIL.

The strong anisotropy of the nitrates and carbonates receives a natural explanation
in terms of the intrinsic anisotropy of the NO,~ and CO,~~ ions and the parallel orienta-
tions of all the ions in the crystal. (The contribution to the susceptibility of the crystal
from the metallic ions is presumably isotropic.) The fact that ~, — y, has the same
value for both the nitrates and nearly the same value for the four carbonates is then
readily understood. Indeed, it is possible, as has been shown in a recent paper,* to
calculate the actual magnetic anisotropy of the NO,~ion from the Cotton-Mouton
constant of nitric acid (or of aqueous solutions of nitrates) and this value is found to be
in satisfactory agreement with the observed value of x; — y for the crystal.

Why the nitrate and the carbonate ions are so strongly anisotropic is difficult to
understand. Presumably it is connected with their plane structure; graphite, benzene,
