A straightforward step of composition between an adjective
and a noun was enough to elicit a similarly timed increase
in MEG activity localizing to the vmPFC. In haemodynamic
research, it was also becoming clear that the vmPFC is part
of the general ‘semantic system’ of the brain, based on a
meta-analysis of a large set of neuroimaging studies [15,16]. Importantly, the simple composition of adjectives and
nouns also elicited another consistent effect, in fact more
consistent that the vmPFC effects, which we sometimes have
not replicated (e.g. [17]). The second effect localized in the left
anterior temporal lobe (LATL) and occurred earlier, at around
200-250 ms after the onset of a word in its combinatory context
(figure 1). It was already well-known that in haemodynamic
measures, a contrast between sentences and unstructured lists
elicits an increase in the LATL for the sentences (e.g. [19-22]),
and we had also observed this effect in MEG [23].
