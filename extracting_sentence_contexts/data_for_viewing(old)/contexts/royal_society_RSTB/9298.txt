microbial community structure (e.g. [17,43]) and community
function [44] in aquatic sediments. This is the first study of
which we are aware that investigates how the overall commu-
nity structure and function of sediment microbial communities
may be influenced by ALAN. We found evidence that seasonal
changes in community structure and function are less pro-
nounced in sediments exposed to ALAN, supporting our
third hypothesis. The field samples provide evidence because
the seasonal effect was reduced in the ALAN-treated commun-
ities after five months of exposure. After 1 year of artificial
illumination in the lit site, this trend continued with the pre-
treated sediment no longer showing a clear seasonal response
to temperature. In fact, results from the pre-treated sediment
community suggest that ALAN may be the sole trigger and
that it may override other seasonal triggers such as tempera-
ture. Consequently, this results in a loss of temporal structure
and may lead to a loss of diversity.

ALAN represents a sustained perturbation that may have
long-term cumulative effects. However, much of the available
knowledge is based on short-term experiments within one gen-
eration, typically over days to weeks. These do not allow the
consideration of response mechanisms, such as acclimation,
adaptation, physiological, behavioural or even evolutionary
compensatory mechanisms linked to environmental context
