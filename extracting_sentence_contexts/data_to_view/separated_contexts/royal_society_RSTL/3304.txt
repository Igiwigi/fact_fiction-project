These results established in my mind most satisfactorily, the possibility of giving
to paper all the properties of the silver plates. It is clearly shown, that a degree of
oxidation is required on the metallic surface. From this fact, the necessity is 8ug-
gested of examining the peculiarities of action manifested by iodine, on the oxides of
silver produced in different ways, and their relative states of sensibility to luminous
influence induced by iodidation. * See Philosophical Magazine, vol. xvi.
