284 MR. NEWPORT ON THE REPRODUCTION OF LOST PARTS

series on Lepidopterous insects, the results of which I have now the honour to com-
municate to the Royal Society.

Myriapoda.

The facts already ascertained respecting the periodical development of new 8egments
to the body in this class, led me to anticipate a favourable result in experimenting
on the reproduction of the antennz and legs. In the spring of 1841, I had placed
about thirty nearly full-grown individuals of Tulis terrestris and Tulis niger in a
closed vessel filled with clay and mould. Many of these individuals deposited ova,
some of which I succeeded in rearing.

During the time these Tuli were confined together, I found several of them deprived
of one of the antennz, and also of some of the legs, which I attributed to their
attacks on each other. This cireumstance led me further to believe that these organs
when lost are reproduced. In order to put this conclusion to the test, I cut off one
of the antennz and some of the legs of an individual that had not yet attained to
more than two-thirds of the adult size of the species, and confined it in company
