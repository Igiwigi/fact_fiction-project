always necessary to employ two dry exciters, that is, two
metals, or one metal and charcoal, in order to occasion con-
tractions. c
Gold and zinc, the first the most perfect of the metals, the
other an imperfect one, operate together very powerfully in pro-
ducing contractions; while gold, and the next most perfect me-
tal, silver, operate very feebly. It would seem. therefore, that
the more similar the metals are, which are thus used, the less is
the power arising from their combination. Two pieces of the
same metal, but with different portions of alloy, are still more
feeble than gold and silver ; and the power of such pieces be-
comes less and less, in proportion as they approach each other.

that they have never observed muscles to move from the em-
ployment of two such pieces of metal, or of one piece of metal
having the same fineness through its whole extent. Others,
