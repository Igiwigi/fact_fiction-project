But we have no right
to assume that -the energy of the system, so far as to include movements of the
conductors and mechanical ‘forces, can be completely expressed by this formula with
only the electric co-ordinates and the sensible co-ordinates of the matter involved in it ;
for the mechanism that links them together is too complicated to be treated other-
wise than statistically. We may however proceed as in the electrostatic problem ; a
