The advantage of using the non-dimensional J(n,m)* (u,v) integrals was
that for a given L value they were all of the same order of magnitude (every J value lay in
the range 1 to about 3/5), and this both expedited the matrix contractions (see equation (29))
and greatly reduced the chances of error. Since the matrix contractions constituted a
major part of the numerical work of the wave-function calculations this was a very important
factor. It is interesting to note that it was possible to keep the J tables much more compact
than would otherwise have been the case, by using the fact that it was found satisfactory
to work with sets of «’s (see equation (25)) and hence of the w’s and v’s, which were in the
ratio of small integers. The J values used thus corresponded to four small integral arguments

and were tabulated accordingly.
