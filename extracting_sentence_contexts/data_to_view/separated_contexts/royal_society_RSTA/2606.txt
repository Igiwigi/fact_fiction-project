In the lower crust, there are clusters of seismicity at depths of approximately 15 and 20 km
beneath the caldera, although they are located beneath the edge of the caldera rather than directly
under its centre. Small regions of lowered seismic velocity are associated with them, but the
anomalies are much smaller than in the shallower crust, which is probably why we are able
to detect seismicity within them. As discussed in an earlier section, the very fact that there is
seismicity here suggests that melt is moving within or through these regions. In addition to the evidence for melt beneath Askja volcano itself, there are also several locations
of persistent seismicity in the mid and lower crust along the neovolcanic zone associated with
Askja (orange dots, figure 6). These have been known to be active for over a decade, ever since
there have been seismometers in the area capable of recording them.
