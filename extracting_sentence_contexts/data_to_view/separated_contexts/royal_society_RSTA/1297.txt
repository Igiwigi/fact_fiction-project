Transition flaw size analysis: geometry and loading configuration of the numerical model. : >

consideration of a finite ¢ > 0+ introduces a critical stress proportional to 1/V€, which is absent in :
Griffith’s formulation and linear elastic fracture mechanics. Thus, ¢ becomes a material property. D8
The motivation for adopting a positive, constant ¢ stems from the fact that Griffith’s theory is tw
unable to capture some well-characterized size effects. One of these important size effects is the i
transition flaw size concept, which is the cornerstone of many engineering standards and fracture :8
mechanics-based engineering design; if a crack is smaller than the transition flaw size, then the a
crack will not grow and the specimen will fail at the material strength (or at the yield stress oy, :
if plastic design is considered). We shall show here that the transition flaw size paradigm is a
natural by-product of variational phase field fracture models that consider ¢ to be an internal
material length.
