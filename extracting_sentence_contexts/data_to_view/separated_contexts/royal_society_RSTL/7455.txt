INTRODUCTION,
AMoNGsT the physical properties which point out the general relationship and classifica-
tion of chemical substances, none has 80 deservedly obtained the confidence of chemists
as isomorphism. The vanadium compounds have, however, proved a remarkable and
unexplained exception to the conclusions which generally follow from well-ascertained
identity of crystalline form. RAMMELSBERGÂ®*, and afterwards, more completely, ScHapusF, pointed out the fact that
the mineral vanadinite from several localities (a compound of lead vanadate and lead
chloride) is isomorphous with apatite, pyromorphite, and mimetesite, minerals consisting
of calcium phosphato-fluoride, lead phosphato-chloride, and lead arsenato-chloride,
having the formulz 3(Ca, P, O,). Ca Fl, ; 3(Pb, P, Og).Pb Cl,, and 3(Pb, As, O,).Pb Cl,. The crystalline form of all these minerals is an hexagonal prism, terminated by 6-sided
pyramids.
