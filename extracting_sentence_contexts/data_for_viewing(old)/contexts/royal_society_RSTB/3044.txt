the same way; and that the light-conditions which induce a contraction ot
these pigments into their chromatophore-centres, induce also an expansion of the
blue. The blue (nocturnal) phase may be called forth either by darkness or by
exposing Hippolyte varians to scattered white light, e.g., in white porcelain dishes
(white background effect) ; or in clear glass dishes into which sea-water is poured with
sufficient violence to produce and maintain a foam.

In this section, we bring forward facts which enable us, as we think, to carry our
knowledge of the significance of these pigments and pigment-changes, a step further
forward.

When appropriate light-stimulation is provided, the red and yellow pigments flow
out from the chromatophore-centres along definite channels. In some Crustacea, e.g.,
Macromysis flecuosa, M. inermis, &c., these channels, the branches of the chromato-
phores, may be seen clearly in the living animal even when all pigment has withdrawn
from them into the chromatophore-centres. In JHippolyte varians and allied species
the branches of the chromatophores are much finer and are only easily visible when
they are naturally injected with their pigments.

The nocturnal (blue) pigment of Hippolyte only expands when the red and yellow
