£& The abnormal entry 29 for aneroid No. 3 is really due to the occurrence of
"appreciable permanent changes of zero in the course of 2 experiments over the
grange 30-21 inches. On one of these occasions, after a full day’s rest, the aneroid
Bead no less than ‘08 inch lower than before the experiment.
s The irregularity in the other results is due partly to the comparative fewness of
‘Ethe experiments, and partly to the fact that the pressure at the end of the experi-
Ament was in reality to some extent different from that at the start. It was usual, in
fact, to treat the atmospheric pressure at the time being as 30 inches, unless it
exceeded this value by several tenths of an inch.
§ 21. In the 24 experiments the aneroids were read at intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20,
60, 120, and 1440 minutes after the return to atmospheric pressure. The similarity
of the phenomena for the several aneroids and the several ranges is brought out
more clearly by tabulating D,/D, than D, itself. This is done in Table XVI.
Initially, of course, 7.c., when ¢ = 0, D,/D, is unity.
