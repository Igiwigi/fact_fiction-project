knowledge of the origin of the elements, beginning with statements that are best supported and
proceeding to statements of increasing uncertainty. For reference, astronomers will not bet against
statements rated ‘certain’ even at million-to-one odds, whereas statements with low confidence
will find more than half of all astronomers believing that alternatives are more likely. We highlight
the best evidence for our current understanding of nucleosynthesis rather than providing a
comprehensive view of this vast subject.

2. Stars fuse nuclei to make new elements

Confidence: Certain

A century ago, Eddington suggested that the Sun’s power arises in the nuclear fusion of hydrogen
into helium, based on two facts. First, four protons have more mass than a 4He nucleus, so
helium production liberates the lost rest mass energy Amc”. Second, the temperature in the centre
of the Sun must be enormous to provide thermal pressure to keep the Sun from collapsing
under its own weight [3,4]. The violent collisions of atomic nuclei at these temperatures and
densities are sufficient to sustain nuclear reactions. No other source of energy was known that
could produce the total amount of energy the Sun has emitted over the past 5 billion years. In
1925, Payne showed that the Sun has a large fraction of hydrogen, unlike the Earth, thereby
demonstrating that the necessary fuel for hydrogen fusion to power the Sun was there in
abundance [5].
