A point of special interest is the rise of the lower eyelids. This is due to an
elastic recoil of the lids when the depressor of the lower eyelids is paralysed. The
interest attached to this point lies in the fact that Cobra venom and another
Colubrine venom produce the same symptom, while it is invariably absent in the
course of Daboia poisoning. We have therefore concluded that the minimum lethal dose of our specimen of
dried Krait venom was, in the case of the frog, about 0°0005 grm. per kilo. ; in the
case of the rat, 0°001 grm. per kilo., and in the case of the rabbit as low as
0:00008 grm. per kilo. Our supply of the venom was too small to allow us to
determine the lethality in other animals.
