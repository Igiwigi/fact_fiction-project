Of the two levelling screws at the left end the back one is
bluntly pointed and rests in a conical depression in the intermediate carriage top,
and forms the pivot of the whole operation of this slight adjustment for azimuth,
The front left screw has a slightly spherical but almost flat termination, and merely
rides on the surface of the intermediate carriage during the operation. These three
levelling screws thus provide at the same time the means of levelling, slight raising
or lowering, and, with the aid of the milled-headed front screw, for slight azimuth
adjustment of the bars. They afford, in fact, all the adjustments required for insuring
parallelism of the defining marks on the standard bars and the micrometer spider-
lines, and for finely adjusting a defining line to the focus of the microscope, when it is
not desired to touch the microscope itself for fear of disturbing its adjustment as a
beam compass, in comparing a second bar with a standard bar. The ordinary table-top, for all experimental purposes, is simply a truly planed
surface on which bars, Grayson rulings, or other objects under observation can be
directly supported. The second of the three interchangeable table tops is the one
which is shown marked v, in figs. 3 and 4, It is specially constructed to support
a pair of standard bars independently, each on a pair of friction rollers at
the Airy positions, or at any positions officially required.
