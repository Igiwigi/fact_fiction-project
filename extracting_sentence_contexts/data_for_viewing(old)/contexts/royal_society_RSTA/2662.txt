of access, and achievable imaging performance.

There were only a few initial locations with a sufficiently low enough altitude to allow the
imaging of the bottom of the crater (albeit with a long data-taking period), and one of these was
Casina di Amelia (posizione Nord 600 m in figure 11). Although there is no electricity available,
in the end we chose this site for deployment because of the nice gated road leading to the site that
can only be accessed by the authorities of the Ente Parco Nazionale del Vesuvio, and also because
this site has the most favourable signal-to-background ratio. This background derives from low-
energy scattered muons [7] which have lost their original direction. They are scattered mainly in
the topmost soil and arrive in massive numbers on the detector.

The lead walls used in the MURAVES hodoscopes will act as ‘minimum muon energy’
selectors, with a turn-on point of ~1 GeV. In fact, our final deployment will consist of four (not
three) XY layers, with the fourth layer sitting behind a 60 cm thick lead wall (figure 12) used as an
antiveto counter. We plan to install three 1 m? muon hodoscopes inside the containers (figure 13).
A fourth slot (with its accompanying lead block) will be used for special calibration runs with the
hodoscopes pointing away from Vesuvius towards the open sky.

As there are no electrical mains available on site, we are installing solar panels on the container
roofs with back-up batteries to ensure 24h continuous operation.

The first engineering work finally started in June this year with the placing of the concrete
supports for the five ton lead walls. Once this work is finished, the containers will be placed in
