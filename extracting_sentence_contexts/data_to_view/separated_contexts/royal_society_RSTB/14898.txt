Marine environments are not exempt from this largely land-based pollutant. Both direct sources of light (e.g. from marine infrastructure, coastal lighting) and
skyglow (lighting emitted or reflected upwards, scattered in the atmosphere
and reflected back to the Earth’s surface; [4]) from urban centres contribute to
the artificial light that can disrupt marine life in coastal habitats. In fact, ALAN
from coastal developments reaches more than 22% of the world’s near-shore
environments [5]. An estimated 1.6 million km” of the world’s coastal seas are
