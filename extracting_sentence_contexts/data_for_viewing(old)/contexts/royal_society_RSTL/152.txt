merely upon its initial figure and motion. If it were supposed
that the chord, when inflected into right lines, resolved itself
necessarily into a number of secondary vibrations, according to
some curves which, when properly combined, would approxi-
mate to the figure given, the supposition would indeed in some
respects correspond with the phaznomenon related; as the coef-
ficients of all the curves supposed to end at the angle of inflec-
tion would vanish. But, whether we trace the constituent curves
of such a figure through the various stages of their vibrations,
or whether we follow the more compendious method of EULER

'S to the same purpose, the figures resulting from this series of
2 vibrations are in fact s0 simple, that it seems inconceivable how
B the ear should deduce the complicated idea of a number of
BH heterogeneous vibrations, from a motion of the particles of air
z which must be extremely regular, and almost uniform ; an uni-
3 formity which, when proper precautions are taken, is'not con-
S tradicted by examining the motion of the chord with the assist-
E ance of a powerful magnifier. This difficulty occurred very
Ez strongly to EuLER ; and DE LA GRANGE even suspects some
a fallacy in the experiment, and that a musical ear judges from

previous association. But, besides that these squnds are disco-
verable to an ear destitute of such associations, and, when the
sound is produced by two strings in imperfect unison, may be
