on in the tubes, appearing at a stage in the process which varies somewhat with the
temperature employed. But the great difficulty is that, as soon as formed, it shares
itself in the hydrolysis, and no adjustment of the conditions will prevent this. The
consequent smallness of the yield, and the obstinately close union with unaltered
urates, make any attempt to purify the yellow substance extremely difficult.

The substance, however, is one of very high tinctorial power, and solutions of
pigmented urate from the tubes are of fine yellow colour and strongly fluorescent.
â€˜The colour and fluorescence of such solutions are indeed identical with those of the
natural yellow pigment, and are affected in identical manner by reagents. So close
is this resemblance that, with the knowledge that both are related to uric acid, one
eannot but be impressed with the likelihood of the identity of the yellow substances.
More direct evidence of the identity thus suggested is found in the fact that the
artificial product under treatment similar to that which converts the natural pigment
into lepidoporphyrin yields a purple derivative, apparently identical with the latter
substance.

A yellow solution of pigmented urate, prepared according to the method of Htast-
wetz, will, if heated on the water-bath with 15 per cent. sulphuric acid, gradually
come to show the absorption bands of lepidoporphyrin, and will eventually yield a
purple precipitate of this substance. But the reaction is clogged by the close associa-
tion of the large proportion of uric acid with the yellow substance, and may be slow
to commence. A modified procedure, however, enables the artificial product to be
obtained with greater ease. This consists in adding to the original mixture of uric
acid and water, before heating, sufficient sulphuric acid to neutralize all the ammonium
