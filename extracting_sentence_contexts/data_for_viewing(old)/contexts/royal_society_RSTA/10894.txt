The following table illustrates the degree of closeness of these various formule as
applied to 17 selected heads of very different sizes. We observe that while the formule
give considerable differences in the absolute capacities, especially in the case of the
macrocephalic heads, the relative order of the heads as determined by all the formule
is the same with but two exceptions. In the first place (14), (15), (17) and (18)
give a relative order entirely the same, except for the slight displacement of Professor
Howes under (18). For the females (16) is also entirely in accord with (14), (15),
(17) and (18). The second displacement is that of Professor Wxtpon’s head under
(16), which alters its place by two. I can only account for this by the fact that
Professor Wetpon has a high cephalic index (82’7), and therefore the German
formula was likely to give a better result than one based on the average of the
German and of a less brachycephalic race like the Aino,
