E $ 1. Mechanical stimulation.—The only remark I have to make in this connexion is,
= that when the paralyzed swimming-organ of Aurelic aurita is stimulated by a single
S mechanical irritation, it often responds with two, and more rarely with three contractions,
- which are separated from one*another by an interval of about the same length as the
2 normal diastole of the unmutilated animal.
= d 2. Chenueal stimulation.—Dilute spirit, or other irritant, when dropped on the
<- paralyzed swimming-organ of Aurelia aurita, often gives rise to a whole series of
ie rhythmical pulsations, the systoles and diastoles following one another at about the
[= same rate as is obseryable in the normal swimming-motions of the unmutilated
-2 animal.
E d 3. Thermal 8timulation.—lIt is somewhat difficult, in the case of paralyzed swim-
> ming-organs, to prove the occurrence of a contraction in response to thermal stimula-
= tion, from the fact that while these tissnes are not nearly 80 sensitive to this mode of
= excitation as might be anticipated, they are, as observed in my former paper, extraor-
Z dinarily sensitive to mechanical excitation. It therefore becomes difficult to administer
Z the appropriate thermal stimulus without at the same time causing a sufficient mecha-
ke nical disturbance to render it doubtful to which of the stimuli the response is due.
Y 'This may be done, however, by allowing a few drops of heated sea-water to run over
= the excitable snrface while it is exposed to the air. In this and in other ways I have
5 stisfied myself that the paralyzed tissues of swimming-organs respond to sudden eleva-
A tions of temperature.
$ 4. Luminous 8timulation.—It is interesting to note that, in the case of 80me
of the naked-eyed Meduxe, the action of light as a stimulus is most marked and
unfailing. In the case of Sarsia, for instance, a flash of light let fall upon a living
specimen almost invariably causes it to respond with one or more contractions. If
