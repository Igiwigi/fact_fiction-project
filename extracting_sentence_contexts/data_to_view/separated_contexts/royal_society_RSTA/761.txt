The security of these protocols relies on the
computational complexity of the mutual underlying mathematical problem. While this problem
may be hard for a classical computer, it does not necessarily have to be hard for a quantum
computer. In fact, quantum algorithms are already known to solve some of these problems
efficiently. In general, one can say that security based on algorithmic complexity is always
endangered by a correspondingly large increase in computational power even of a classical
computer or by advances of classical algorithms. In the history of cryptography, the only information-theoretically secure way of encrypting
information is by way of the one-time pad.
