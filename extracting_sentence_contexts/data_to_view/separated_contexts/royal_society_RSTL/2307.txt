HARRIS ON SOME ELEMENTARY LAWS OF ELECTRICITY.

the least beyond the interior, as in fig. 21, becomes immediately electrified when the
sphere is charged with electricity.

61. We have yet to notice another seeming exception to the general law (16.) ob-
servable in accumulating variable quantities of electricity on insulated conductors,
and which is found to occur in that peculiar kind of accumulation induced in a body
by electrical influence. Many striking facts lead us to conclude, that excitation by induction, as above
stated (4. 5.), is the immediate effect of a tendency of accumulated electricity to a
given 5tate, or mode of existence : hence an electrified substance is obseryed to exert
a peculiar kind of influence upon surrounding bodies. The immediate result of this
influence, is a sort of temporary change, or displacement, of the electricity which
these bodies already possess; $0 that if they be insulated, a species of accumulation
is apparent in certain parts of them, depending upon a new disposition or state of
their own electricity. Now the attractive force thus induced in a neutral &nbstance,
by the immediate influence of a charged conductor, appears to be as the quantity of
the free electricity in operation directly, that is, as the intensity or exciting cause ;
and as the simple distance between the points of the opposed bodies inversely, which
may be gathered from the following experiments.

(s.) Two conductors, / |, fig. 15, terminating in plane surfaces, as in fig. 22, being
insulated on the stand fig. 15. above described (33.), one of them, hk, was connected
with the electrometer, fig. 2, and the other charged with a given quantity (14.),
whilst withdrawn from the influence of the former.
