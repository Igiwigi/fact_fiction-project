a column more than four times as long when the air was separated from the radiating
surface.

I made the foregoing experiment three times in succession, and after two minutes
found the needle pointing to precisely the same degree; the lowering of the source was
perfectly constant and regular, and in all cases showed a loss equivalent to an absorp-
tion of 50.

It will. be remembered that Professor Macxus obtained a greater absorption with
hydrogen than with either oxygen or air. This reult is perfectly explained by refer-
ence to the quicker convection of this gas. TI operated with hydrogen as I did with air,
first satisfying myself that a column of it 33 inches long exercised an absorption less
than unity. Tn fact it could not be measured. The same hydrogen introduced into the
first chamber, and allowed to remain there for two minutes, caused a withdrawal of heat
from the source equivalent to an absorption of

65.

Now the absorption of air in Professor Macxus's experiments is to that of hydrogen as
11:12 : 14:21,

or as 50 : 64,

while my results of convection are as 50 : 65.
