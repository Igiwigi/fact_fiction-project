A good typical curve
showing this variation is given by CRANZ.Â¢ Another example will be found in fig. 4. We have so far ignored the fact that the shell is actually spinning about its axis of symmetry. There
is no evidence to show that the drag, in the case of symmetry, is appreciably affected by the spin, and its
neglect is probably justified. A more important question is the legitimacy of assuming, as we have tacitly done in (1.001), that the
drag does not depend appreciably on the acceleration of the shell.
