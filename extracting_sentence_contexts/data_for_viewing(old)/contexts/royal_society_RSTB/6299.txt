forms seems to confirm its primitive nature.

Thus no feature of the development or adult anatomy of Ciona can with certainty
be said to be specialized, while there is some evidence that every such feature is a
primitive character.

From this standpoint the remainder of the ascidians will be discussed.

From a cionid-like ancestor ascidians have apparently evolved in two main
directions, one involving the descent of the viscera into the stalk, the other the
shifting of the viscera forwards along the branchial wall. The first of these
evolutionary trends gives rise to the order Aplousobranchiata (LAHILLE) or Kriko-
branchiata (SEELIGER) together with the family Diazonidae. In fact, HARTMEYER
(1923) saw such a close relationship between the diazonids and Ciona that he
included them within one family.

IVâ€”DEscenT OF THE VISCERA

Diazona, like Ciona, is an oviparous genus. It is the only genus with the faculty
for budding that is so. It produces tadpoles like those of Ciona, while the post-
larval ascidian can be distinguished from that of Ciona only by the relative larger
