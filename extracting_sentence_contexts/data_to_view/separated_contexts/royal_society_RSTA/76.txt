If the initial configuration satisfies dy < o_(Vo), then the corresponding solution (p, 1) will blow-up at
a finite time.

(c) Critical thresholds for the two-dimensional Cucker—Smale model
We extend our main result to two-space dimensions
pt + div(pu) =0 (2.5a)

and
wy fu- Vu =| lic = yDuly, 1) 6x, Doty, dy, xeR?, £20, (2.50)
R

where the critical threshold is captured in terms of Vo and its initial divergence do :=
infxesupp(oo) div u(x). The main difficulty here is to control the remaining terms in Vu, beyond
just div u itself. We measure the size of those additional terms, setting

Bo:= sup max{2|dx,Uo2|,2|4x,Uo1|, |x, 401 — Ax, M02\},
xesupp(o)
and we prove that if Bg is sufficiently small then, in fact, all terms of Vu, except for div u, remain
equally small. Theorem 2.10 (two-dimensional critical thresholds in a non-vacuum region). Consider the two-
dimensional CS system (2.5).
