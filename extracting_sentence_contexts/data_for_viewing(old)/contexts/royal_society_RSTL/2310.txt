alloy of lead and tin in equal parts, gives an effect equal to
one-half the effect on tin, added to. one-half the effect on lead,
and 80 on-;. the same may! be said of zinc and tin,

heated by an electrical explosion as much as iron. In accord-
ance with this fact, jt was found that wires drawn from some
foreign gold coins, said to be very pure, were much worse
conductors of electricity, than when drawn from the same
previously refined.

I did not find the conducting power to be influenced by
any new disposition or arrangement of the quantity of metal;
thus, whether the metallic wire was perfectly cylindrical,
flattened into a ribbon, or separated into four smaller wires,
the effect produced was in each case alike.

The influence of a small portion of alloy on the conducting
power renders it necessary to have the metals pure, and I
