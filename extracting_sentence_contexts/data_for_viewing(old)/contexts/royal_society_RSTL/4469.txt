expressions of the modes and conditions of their operation, 80 far as known to the
scientific investigator. That among all these forces there are very intimate mutual
relations, is a conviction which has been gradually increasing in strength in the minds
of philosophical inquirers during the whole of the present century; in consequenece, of
the extraordinary development which the sciences of Chemistry, Electricity, Mag-

netism, Optics, and Thermotics, have undergone during that period, and of theaccumn-
lation. of facts which. more or less distinctly indicate the existence of snch relations
to those who know how to read them aright.  Amongst those who have laboured
most successfully in this line of inquiry, Prof. Farapay stands pre-eminent ; but the
author is not aware, that any other attempt has been made to formularize the entire
series of these mutual relations, than that which has been put forth by Prof. Grove
in his sbort treatise © On the Correlation of Physical Forces;' in which he seeks to
establish © that the various imponderable agencies, or the affections of matter which
constitute the main objects of experimental physics, viz. heat, light, electricity, mag-
netism, chemical aſlinity, and motion, are all correlative or have a reciprocal depend-
ence :—that neither, taken abstractedly, can be said to be the essential or proximate
cause of the others, but that either may, as a force, produce or be convertible into
the other; thus heat may mediately or immediately produce electricity, electricity
may produce heat, and 80 of the rest” (p. 8).
