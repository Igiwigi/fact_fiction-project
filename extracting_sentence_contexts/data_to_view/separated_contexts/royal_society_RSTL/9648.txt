Tn seeking for an explanation, ib had to be borne in mind, that snch mineral
manures did also considerably increase the growth of leguminous crops grown on
arable land ; and, further, that when a leguminous crop is grown on arable land
it not only removes much more nitrogen from a given area than a gramineous one
grown under equal conditions as to soil and season, but it leaves the upper layers
of the oil 80 much richer in nitrogen, and in such condition that the increase may
be determined by the soda-lime method, and the growth of the sncceeding cereal is
considerably augmented. The question, therefore, suggested itselfâ€”how far the
increased growth of the grasses proper in the mixed herbage was due to an increased
accumulation of combined nitrogen available to them, in the upper layers of the oil,
the result of the increased growth of, and accumulation by, the Leguminose, induced
by the mineral manure? Whether, in fact, where the plants are thus growing in
association, there is a paralle] action to that which takes place when they are grown
in alternation ? This explanation obviously itself left unsolved the question of the 8ource of the
nitrogen of the Leguminosw, besides involving other difficulties. Still, ib seemed to
accord with other known facts, and to be at any rate the best that could be offered
in defect of more satisfactory or countervailing evidence.
