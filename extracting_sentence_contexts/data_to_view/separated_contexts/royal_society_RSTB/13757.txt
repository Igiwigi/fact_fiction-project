It is now evident that the sake cluster is poorly
suited to perform GWAS. First, the number of sequences com-
posing this dataset is too low and therefore does not provide
sufficient statistical power for trustworthy associations. Second, the strains composing this cluster are very close to
each other and all share large parts of the genome due to the
fact that the common ancestor is very recent compared to
other datasets. We initially thought that the European wine
subpopulation, being a clear lineage and composed of a high
number of strains (1 = 323), would constitute a good set to per-
form GWAS because the population is not stratified. The
number of false positives by run is very high for a Mendelian
and complex trait and the results obtained with this dataset
should therefore be taken with caution.
