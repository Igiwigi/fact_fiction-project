intensity of the photospheric radiation and the temperature and optical thickness of the
absorbing layer; his formula was thus in reality an interpolation formula. ScHwarzs-
CHILD in effect removed the empiricism from ScuusteR’s formula by balancing the
radiation from the layer against the loss of photospheric radiation. But in this treatment
the distinction between photosphere and absorbing layer disappears ; each shades con-
tinuously into the other; the absorption coefficient of the material no longer appears
explicitly, and the law of darkening of the integrated radiation is free from all
arbitrary constants whatever. Further, as has been shown, it is a straightforward
deduction from SchWARzSCHILD’s theory that for the darkening in the separate colours
a single quantity alone requires to be determined—the effective temperature.

Tt is remarkable that a theory so simple, so logical and showing such general
accordance with the facts should have sprung to birth with such completeness. Its
beauty is best realised when we contrast it with a paper such as that of Oprk (‘ Ast.
Nach.,’ 198, p. 49, 1914), which, clearly written in ignorance of ScHwARzSCHILD’s work,
gropes complicatedly in the same direction.

But the implications of ScuhwaRzscuiLp’s paper have not always been fully realised.
In some interesting ‘‘ remarks on the hypotheses used for explaining the distribution
of the radiating power of the solar disc,” Juttus* stated explicitly the objection to the
then existing theories. “ The fundamental idea that a considerable portion
of the photospheric radiation should be absorbed by a thin atmosphere encounters a
difficulty of greater importance still. This point, I think, has also first been raised by
Scummpr. What becomes of the absorbed energy accumulating in the atmosphere ¢
