and vol. 3, Plate 9, figs. 15-21 and 24-28 (see especially pp. 183-185 and 189, 190),
describes certain structures composed entirely of collar-cells, some of which bear the
closest possible resemblance to my “ pseudo-blastule.” He, in pursuance of his
theory as to the protozoan nature of sponges, interprets them as stages in the
development of the “ciliated gemmules” (free-swimming larve).

Every collar-cell, he supposes, runs through a definite cycle of development :
starting as a simple flagellate cell, it later develops a collar, and, finally, withdrawing
both collar and flagellum, becomes ameeboid. Following out this idea, he can bring
practically any observations on the structure of the larvee into line with his theory ;
for instance, in the amphiblastula he simply assumes that one half has advanced
further in this cycle than the other. He first describes (his fig. 28) a larva of
Grantia compressa entirely composed of flagellated cells (a parenchymula, in fact) ;
this he explains as a very early stage. In reality, it presumably belongs to some
other species which normally possesses a parenchymula larva. As a later modification
of this type he figures a hollow, oval body composed entirely of normal collar-cells
(his fig. 25), exactly like one of my spheres, except for being rather ellipsoid in shape.
There can be very little doubt that this body was accidentally produced from adult
collar-cells, (Its oval outline could be explained in various ways.)

Then he figures, besides normal amphiblastule, others in which the anterior half
looks perfectly normal, but the posterior half seems to be composed of a hemisphere
of adult collar-cells ; the outer ends of these cells protrude considerably beyond what
would be the normal outline of the non-flagellate half (his fig. 26). Here it is quite
possible that a small sheet of collar-cells, detached in teasing up the sponge, had
