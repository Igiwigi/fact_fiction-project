Owing to the dangerous nature of the experiments, and the precautions
necessary to be adopted in exploding such considerable charges of powder, it was not
generally possible to collect the gases more rapidly ; but a comparison of the analysis
of different tubes taken from the same experiment has shown that, at all events within
moderate limits, no change takes place in the composition of the gas by its continued
contact with the solid products,

6. Collection of Solid Products. The collection of the solid products presented much more difficulty than that of
the gaseous products, On opening the cylinder, the whole of the solid products were
found collected at the bottom, there being generally an exceedingly thin (in fact, with
large charges, quite an inappreciable) deposit on the sides. Upon the firing-plug there
was usually a button of deposit, which differed considerably both in appearance and
in chemical composition from the rest. In the button a erystalline structure was
quite apparent, ome of the crystals being large and transparent.
