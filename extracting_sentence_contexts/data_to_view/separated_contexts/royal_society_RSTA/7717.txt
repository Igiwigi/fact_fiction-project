Let A be the value of this product, then

AIL [«, +h—7]!=[3]!4,

where ¢ is an integral function of z. Let ¥ (z) be an integral function of z with integral coeflicients, then if

y (2) ra 0,
when z is any root of z*=1, 4 (z) has a factor z* — 1. Now ¢ is zero when
a,—r= a,—#, and a, —r, «,— 1 only appear as indices of z, thus ¢ is zero

whenever z7"~' = zt‘, i.e, ¢ has a factor

ji gar t-r

Thus ¢ is a function which contains all the factors of

Il fe, —«, +? —7],

rt
In view of the fact that %,, %, ....%, may be looked on at present as arbitrary

h
numbers, the only necessarily repeated factor in this is (1 — 2),
Now when z approaches the value 1, we may take 1 — z = ¢ a small quantity. Then when Z is small

[A] = AC; and

A 8 tp oh

\(a,—r-+s)! aoe


SUBSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS TO INVARIANTS 83

Thus A has no factor 1 — z. The number of factors 1 — z in II [a, + h —r] ! is

x (a, +h—r)=3+(4),

kh
hence ¢ has the factor (1 — 2%), and therefore the factor II [«, — x, —7r-+ ¢].
rt

No other factor is possible for this is of the same order as ¢, and the numerical
factor to be attached is easily seen to be unity.
