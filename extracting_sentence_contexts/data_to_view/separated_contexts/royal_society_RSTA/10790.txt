Thus, so far from the homotyposis being reduced by greater variability, it
actually appears to be slightly increased.

8 Lastly, we may notice (Table LI.) that the variation in the individual amounts
£ to upwards of 97 per cent. of that in the race, or we have another strong fact to aid
é in demolishing the theory that variability is a result of sexual reproduction. Note
