theta and SWR hippocampal brain states, which both have they are often preceded by neocortical activity, consistent with
their own characteristic oscillatory rhythms and behavioural the possibility that their content may be biased by information
correlates [16,19]. During awake, task-engaged behaviours, hip- held in long-term memory [44,45]. During SWRs, neuronal
pocampal activity is dominated by theta oscillations, promoting sequences can be recapitulated in the forwards or reverse
