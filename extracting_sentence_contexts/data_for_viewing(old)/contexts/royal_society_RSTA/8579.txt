throw for m-- is opposite to that for m—., if a happens to be increased by these oscillations
d will also be increased, and 6 and ¢ will be diminished ; om being thus the appropriate

fraction in the case of f.

In the same way, it is easy to see that, so far as permanent magnetism is concerned,
if the effect of a horizontal helix field is to increase a it will now increase b, while c and
d will be diminished. The corresponding fraction for ¢ will therefore be aot

To this it may be objected that the permanent magnetism is due mainly to the vertical
component of the earth’s field, and is therefore small in amount compared with the part
that reverses, whereas the variations of e and f are of the same order of magnitude ;
but it seems possible that this difficulty may be met by the fact that the action of the
helix current on the magnetism which reverses is the resultant of two opposing tendencies

magnetism that succeeds it ; while in the case of the permanent magnetism the action
is all in the same direction.

As already explained, the process of taking the means of the four values of 0, corre-
