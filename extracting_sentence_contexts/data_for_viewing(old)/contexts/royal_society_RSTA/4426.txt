almost always (0.978 probability) observes that the symbol following e is opposite the one that
preceded the e:

Sxr > Sre > Sel OF

Sx] > Sle > Ser.

In other words, an e is almost always sandwiched between two unlike symbols drawn from / and
r. There is then a 0.494 probability that the process will return to the central states Syj and Sy; on
emission of either an / or an r. If not, then another e is observed. Thus, even though pairs of e’s
(ee) are unlikely (and, in fact, prohibited in this e-machine) the probability of observing two e’s
separated by a single r or / is surprisingly large. It appears that they ‘clump’ into small regions.
Often one examines the causal architecture for hints of what kinds of faults might be present. :
But since the most visited states (S,j and Sy;) do not represent a cycle, there is no parent crystal [=
here. Instead, one might take the view that the underlying process is random between | and : 3
r and only occasionally interrupted by e, such that e plays the role of a fault. If so, we think LB
of this as an extrinsic fault, as e is not a part of the structure on either side. In any event, the :
causal architecture of the stacking of TBHB presents an interesting inversion of usual crystal-fault Da
structure dichotomy. It is the core states S,; and Sy, that give rise to the disordered stacking, and Dw
the less visited peripheral states, especially Sj, and Sj, that serve to constrain the probabilities :
of stacking sequences and, hence, impose a sort of ‘structure’. In this view, it is perhaps not too a
extreme to think of TBHB as a kind of ‘anti-crystal’. [83
