If now we suppose the polygon lifted up from the plane, and
these corresponding ares pieced together, we obtain a simple closed surface, without
multiple connectivity. Therefore the genus (genre, Geschlecht) of the group (as defined by Porncars) is
zero. The group however may have, and will in fact be proved to have, sub-
groups whose genus is greater than- zero.
