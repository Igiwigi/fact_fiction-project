In fact, on his return
to England Odling became one of the strongest advocates of Cannizaro’s approach to chemistry. Perhaps he regarded himself in more of a hand-maiden role than as somebody at the forefront of
major discoveries concerning the elements. The fact remains that Odling’s work also failed to have
much impact on the scientific community of the day and that Odling did not pursue the discovery
further. Another possible cause for Odling’s failure to develop his periodic system might be that
he was more interested in the fundamental science rather than in developing what at the time
must have seemed like mere classification.?

7. Gustavus Hinrichs

This author is beyond a doubt the most enigmatic and an unconventional among the
co-discoverers of the periodic system.
