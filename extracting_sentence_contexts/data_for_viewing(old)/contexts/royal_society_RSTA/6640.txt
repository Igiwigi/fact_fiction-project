if the instrument be used at high temperatures.

We haye said a great deal about the air thermometer, because the chief experi-
mental difficulties arose from it ; the other essential part of the apparatus is the
platinum spiral, which we will now proceed to consider.

The Platinum Spiral.

The spirals used in this investigation were all made from the same reel of pu e
platinum wire supplied by Messrs. Jounson, Marrury, and Co. Its purity is attested
by the following facts : (1) the high temperature coefficient of its resistance, 00346,
instead of about ‘0030, as with ordinary platinum ; (2) it was very infusible and
unalterable : after being kept for about two hours at a temperature of about 1200°C., |
its resistance had not altered by 1 in 5000 at 0° C. 3 (3) no impurities could
detected by chemical analysis. 3 3

Details of the wire.—Diameter, about :017 centim. ; resistance, about 5 ohms
metre ; mass, ‘00488 gramme per centim. About 1 metre of the wire is measured
and its ends fused on to tails of thicker platinum wire (diameter, ‘073 centim.) in
oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. (It is less trouble to solder with copper, but the spi
cannot then be boiled with acids in the bulb of the air thermometer.) The wire is
then annealed by passing it slowly through the solid Bunsen flame of a eTCHER
