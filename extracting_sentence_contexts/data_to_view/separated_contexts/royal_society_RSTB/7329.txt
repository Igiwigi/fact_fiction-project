He accounted for the nuclei of his
‘endodermal’ cells by supposing that they arose de novo in the non-nucleated cytoplasmic
spheres, so giving the nucleated large vacuolated cells which he correctly observed forming ‘a
ring-like mass applied all round the edge of the ectodermal patch’ (1886). Although Sedg-
wick gives a long description and discussion of the development of ‘endoderm’ from the
cytoplasmic spheres, he says (1887) of segmentation that, apart from the superficial blasto-
meres, ‘the breaking up of the rest of the ovum into irregular masses cannot be regarded as
a process in any way related to cleavage, inasmuch as the nucleus takes no part in it’, and
in a footnote, ‘This process is probably identical with the formation of the non-nucleate
yolk spheres found in many arthropoda.’ The former conclusion is correct, but applies
more forcibly to the facts of development here described than to the version arrived at by
Sedgwick. Whether the cytoplasmic spheres represent yolk spheres is uncertain. They are
clearly depleted of food material, and it has been suggested above (p. 529) that they may be
homologous with the ‘pseudo-blastomeres’ of yolky forms such as Nebalia.
