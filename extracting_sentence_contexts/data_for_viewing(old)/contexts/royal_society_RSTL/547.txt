Let AB=z, BD =y and y = yz be the equation of the

curve, then BC = 2,

and DC = y* + (2 - . and by the condition of the Problem .
we have

Cha + ne [v{z+ " P _)
This is apparently a very difficult functional equation, and I
am not acquainted with any direct method of solving other
similar ones. It is in fact only from a peculiar condition which
this equation involves that any Solutions have been obtained,
=; Ks

hence

the condition to which I allude is, that the Ld

not change, when for x we substitute z TY
