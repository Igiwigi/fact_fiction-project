However, the results in figure 9a show the limits of the linear shunt, which was tuned in
order to approximate an equal-peak configuration at low forcing amplitude. In accordance with
figure 1b, increasing forcing amplitudes generate a strong detuning of the absorber. In fact, the
detuning is even more significant in the present case because of a slight increase of both the
piezoelectric capacitance and the inductance value. For the inductance, recall that our passive
component is made of magnetic material that does not behave purely linearly, as shown in
equation (3.2). Concerning the piezoelectric capacitance, it was experimentally noticed that it is
