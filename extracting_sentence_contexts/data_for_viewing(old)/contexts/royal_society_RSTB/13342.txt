1. Introduction

In comparison to other species, human societies are characterized by the fact
that they create rules about what individuals are supposed to do in different
situations. These rules and the social processes that generate and shape them
make up what are known as ‘institutions’, which affect different aspects of
our lives and fundamentally regulate and structure social interactions [1-5]. It
is argued that this ability to create institutions helps bond societies together
and underpins the fact that humans are able to cooperate, work together and
perform collective behaviours with genetically unrelated individuals on a
scale not seen in other species [2,6]. As well as acknowledging our species’
capacity for cooperative behaviour, it is also important to recognize that
across time and space there has been a great deal of variation in the scale at
which human societies have been able to act collectively [7,8]. Here we argue
that the ability of humans to construct systems involving culturally inherited
