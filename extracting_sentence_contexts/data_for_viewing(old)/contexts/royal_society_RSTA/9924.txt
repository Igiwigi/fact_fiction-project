For the last, the measurements of S give v = 84°5 or 13 too small, i.e., a wave-
length difference 5°2 A.U. too small. If the second line is correct, showing good
agreement with the formula, the first would therefore be —2 wrong instead of —7°15.
As is seen, the second formula gives extremely good agreement. If the limit is
higher than 16810 the series becomes a D type. In these inexact measurements,
however, it is probably best to use Rypprre’s form without the « Even now the
limit is not that calculated for VD (2); there may be a small error in the latter, but
hardly to the extent of 200. We may feel as certain, however, that the limit and
VD (2) are the same as for the corresponding case of P() and VS(1), in which the
“error” is also considerable. The strongest evidence is in the striking fact that the
Dy and D,, series generate the doublet separation, For m = 2, 4 = 22920, which
would be far outside BerGMANN’s region of observation.

The only lines now left unaccounted for in Cs are 13711 B, and 5209 R. The wave-

number of 13711 is 7291°4. VD, (2) = 17040* roughly, VP, (2) = 31400—21764°7
= 9635°3, so that VD, (2)—VP.(2) = 7405. There is just a possibility, therefore,
that 13711 may be the latter; but, if so, it is curious that the P, should come in and
not P,, which we should expect to give a stronger line.
