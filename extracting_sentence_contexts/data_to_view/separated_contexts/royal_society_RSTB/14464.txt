In comparison, auditory spatial tuning is broad,
within both the primary auditory cortex and PT [9,10], and
neural tuning to sound-source locations seem to be rep-
resented by an opponent process, based on differences in the
activity of two broadly tuned channels formed by contra-
and ipsilaterally preferring neurons [9,11,12]. By contrast to the robust retinotopic organization observed
in all early visual areas [13,14], no map exists for auditory
location (or for proxy cues, such as interaural level or phase
differences) in mammalian auditory cortex [15]. The reason
for this is not clear, but it may be related to the fact that that reti-
notopic location and auditory frequency are directly encoded
within the retina and the cochlea. Early visual area maps do
not represent spatial position [16], which must be computed
by combining retinal signals, head position and eye position. Similarly, early visual area maps do not reflect depth, which
is inferred using a combination of cues such as stereopsis and
motion parallax.
