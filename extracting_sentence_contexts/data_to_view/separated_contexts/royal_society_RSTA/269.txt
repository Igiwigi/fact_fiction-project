Now reflect Sig, through B to A. This gives Ajgg- Inspection of (1) shows that
the only points of 4,4, which are in line with points of D and of ยง are those where
0,, U, are non-zero, but #, = 0, = 4, = 0. This means that reflexion of A,,, through

D to S produces the space $5573, obtained in fact by retaining those parameters whose
suffixes are 0 or 1 only. Thus

When such alternate reflexion in B and D is continued as before, we obtain the following
result: Dye = Si6g> Aros S12678 > A 12678 > 5123678 >
