The figures followed by E are estimated from the others which are the direct results
of experiment. It will be seen (Table I.) that the value for specific heat increases
with rise of temperature in every case except silver telluride, where the mean specific
heats found between 15° and 309° and 390° GC, respectively are less than at lower
temperatures. This irregularity is attributed to the fact that during the later
experiments the mass cracked and it was found necessary to re-melt it several times. This was done in hydrogen gas, and though no change in appearance was observed,
some slight change in composition or structure may have been produced. These
figures have, therefore, not been used in the subsequent calculations.
