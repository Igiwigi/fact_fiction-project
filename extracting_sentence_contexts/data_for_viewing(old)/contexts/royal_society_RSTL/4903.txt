"The action of methylamine, of amylamine, and of aniline upon cyanate of allyl, has
given us analogous results. We have not submitted these products to analysis; but
their resemblance to the preceding compounds, and especially their mode of formation,
leave no doubt respecting their composition. These products, as is obvious, belong to
that numerous class of compound ureas which have been studied with such remarkable
results by M. WuRTz.

Diallyl-urea (Sinapoline).

When cyanate of allyl is heated with water, it assumes a buttery consistence and ulti-
mately solidifies entirely. The product obtained under these cireumstances possesses all
the properties of sinapoline, which, as is known, is formed by the action of hydrated
protoxide of lead upon mustard oil, and is in fact diallyl-urea. The properties of this
substance presenting complete identity with those of sinapoline, and its mode of for-
mation being perfectly similar to that of dimethyl- and diethyl-urea, we have not
thought it necessary to submit it to analysis. This body is likewise formed when
cyanate of allyl is boiled with an aqueous solution of potassa, with the view of trans
forming it, after the manner of ordinary cyanic ether, into an alkaline carbonate and an
ammonia-base. In this case it is necessary to arrest the action at a certain point, for
if the ebullition be continued, the sinapoline is destroyed in its turn, producing car-
bonate of potassium and ammonia-bases. ;

"The formation of sinapoline, by the reciprocal action of cyanate of allyl and water, 1s
represented by the following equation:â€”
