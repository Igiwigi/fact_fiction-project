2144 h. 3276. Place approximate, by equatoreal zone review.

2189 h. 745=V. 52. Not seen by Lord Rosse when once looked for (see note on
No. 132, &e.).

2192 h. 3294. The minute in R.A. doubtful.

2197 h. 3295. The great nebula about 7 Argus. According to a letter from Mr. Eyre
B. Powell of Madras, a most extraordinary change has taken place in this nebula
since my figure of it was delineated. He states that the southern end of the
curious oval yacuity close to the great star, which was decidedly closed when I
depicted it, is now decidedly open. Should this be established, it will be the
most extraordinary fact that has yet appeared in the history of a nebula.

2201 h. T54=1I. 99. M. D'Arrest found this nebula in the Leipzig refractor, bright
enough to be ranked in the first class. And it is marked as * very bright ‚Äù in
this Catalogue by a mean of 5 observations. It must have been ill seen in the
earlier observation when classed as II.

5 6=LIL. 131 and h. 777=IIL 88. I adopt, on due consideration, the opinion

2234) of Auwwers, that III. 88 and IL. 181 are not the s&ame. Their having been
successtyely observed in the same sweep is decisive. Also, that IV. 6 is not
IL. 88, but in reality identical with II. 131. The descriptions are made out
in conformity with this.
