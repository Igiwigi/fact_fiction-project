ture indicated by the thermometer; this again would cause the emissivity to be
under-estimated. Taking the maximum values of the temperature and pressure, we
find that in air at 160 atmospheres and 1200° C. the emissivity is 0°01259, and the
heat dissipated = E97.d = 5:249 C.G.S. units per second, per unit length, The inside

per unit length. Taking the conductivity of steel as 0°11, this would correspond to
a fall of temperature of 7°°3 C.

Thus the temperature interval we estimated at 1200, really was 1193. This cause
of error would be very serious were it not for the fact that it decreases not only with
the square of the temperature but also with the pressure. At 160 atmospheres and
500° C. the flow of heat is 1612 C.G.S. units, making the error 2°°3 C.; at 100 atmo-
spheres and 500° C. the error is 1°°6 C., and for 30 atmospheres and 500° C, = 1°-0C.

Over the greater part of the range of observation the error due to this cause is
therefore below one-third per cent., but it rises to about two-thirds per cent. at the
highest temperatures and pressures

Results obtained.

In all cases the heat dissipated by a hot body surrounded by gas is the sum of
three distinct quantities, all three being functions of the temperature, and one
