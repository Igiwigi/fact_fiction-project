In particular, the paper contains versions of Theorem 3.5 for unbounded semigroups; see
e.g. [96, Section 4].

4. Applications to second-order Cauchy problems

Since this survey emphasizes abstract aspects we found it instructive, in passing to descriptions
of illustrative applications of our techniques, to begin with a discussion of an abstract model and
then to illustrate briefly, in the concluding remarks, how it relates to damped wave equations. This subsection is based on the presentation in a very nice paper by Anantharaman & LÃ©autaud
[97, Part II], which in fact considers a slightly more general set-up than ours. Note that similar
arguments can be found in a number of papers and books dealing with asymptotic behaviour of
hyperbolic equations and operator matrices, but we refrain from mentioning all of them here. For the remainder of this section, let A and B be self-adjoint positive semi-definite operators on
a Hilbert space X.
