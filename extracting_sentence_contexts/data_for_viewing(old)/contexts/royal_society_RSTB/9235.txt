one context is utterly incomprehensible, and even offensive,
to observers comfortable in another: consider, for example,
the riot that followed the premiére of Stravinsky’s The Rite of
Spring in the 1920s. Thus, the value relation is between not
just the observer and the artefact, but between the observer
and the artefact in a given context. Finally, value is also a func-
tion of the creator. Expectations are based on past experience.
We are disappointed when our favourite author, admired
musician or best-loved car company turns out a product that
underperforms.

In summary, we treat value as a relation between an arte-
fact, its creator and its observers and the context in which
creation and observation takes place.

(b) Exploration, transformation and the paradigm shift
Boden [3] also introduces an important philosophical distinc-
tion, between exploratory creativity, where the conceptual space

being explored is fixed (though possibly not all visible, and
possibly infinite) and exploration occurs within that space
(for example, different songs in a particular style), and transfor-
mational creativity in which the space itself is subject to change
(developing from one style to another). Coupled with suc-
cessful persuasion, transformational creativity is what leads
