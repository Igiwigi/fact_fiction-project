Electric charges (not included in the above action) have a higher-dimensional interpretation as
the endpoints of fundamental IIB strings, and magnetic charges have a similar interpretation as
endpoints of IIB D-strings (i.e. D1-branes). Leaving aside many issues to focus on the fact that we now have an interpretation of
electromagnetic waves as disturbances of an aether consistent with SR, let us consider whether
the tension of this D3-brane aether can be identified with the cosmological constant; i.e. can we
have Tp3 = A? The answer is no because in BI electrodynamics there is a maximum value of
the electric field (this was its motivating feature) and the BI parameter T is the corresponding
maximum energy density, but atomic physics experiments put a lower bound on any hypothetical
maximum value of the electric field [23], and this is equivalent to the bound T 2 10° Jm-3. By
contrast, cosmological observations yield A ~ 10~1°J m~%, a discrepancy of more than 40 orders
