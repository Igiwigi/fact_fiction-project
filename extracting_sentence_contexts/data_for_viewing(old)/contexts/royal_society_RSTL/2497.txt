with fringes of silvecy gru. At the head of the pool, where the velocity acquired by
the water in the rapid immediately above it was not yet greatly diminished, an ap-
pearance of a different kind presented itself. There are here seyeral large stones in
the bed of the stream, but none of them projecting above the water. On the faces of
these opposed to the stream there were seen quantities of gru of a different aspect
from that further down. It was not arranged in the same cauliflower shapes, but in
angular masses, like wreaths of snow blown by the wind. It wanted, too, the silvery
glance of the other, and had more the appearance of a pale ash-coloured mud. On

reaching it with the end of a pole, its consistency was found to be less firm ; in fact,
it was only a heap of detached uncemented spicult pressed against the Stones, and
retained there mechanically by the action of the water, in a certain modified state
of its velocity. The source of these heaps of uncemented spiculz will s0on be no-
ticed. This pool, as indeed was the case with all the pools in the river, had at its
edges and in its little bays narrow pieces of surface-ice, extending a foot or two from
the banks.

The rapid immediately above this, not unlike that at the bridge, was covered at
the bottom with silvery gru, with one exception. The river was low at the time from
long-continued deficiency of rain, and the water had deserted the south side of the
channel, leaving many little pools among the stones, communicating more or less
freely by irregular little currents with the main stream. The pools were coyered over
