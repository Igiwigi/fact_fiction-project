A small vertical deformation therefore
does not produce a large extension in the horizontal links. Also, as the anisotropy parameter
a increases, figure 7 shows that the magnitude of @ increases. This result is due to the fact that
increasing a corresponds to a softening of the lateral links in the medium, enabling the horizontal
links to undergo greater axial deformations. It can also be clearly seen from figure 7 that for all admissible speeds of bridge crack failure the
parameter a is less than 1. As a consequence, if the horizontal links inside the chain are assumed
to have the same strength as the vertical links, all admissible bridge crack regimes are realizable
in the structures considered.
