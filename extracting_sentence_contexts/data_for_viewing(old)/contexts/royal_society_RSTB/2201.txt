In the experiment just recorded only comparatively few pauses of the heart occur
but they may return periodically for at least two hours.

The pause terminates spontaneously, and is in fact not promoted by palpation,
either of the chest wall or of the heart itself. Death has not been seen to occur
during this pause; it results usually after the phase of intermission has passed.

The character of the arrest and resumption of action has been observed directly by
removing a portion of the chest wall while the record from the carotid was being
taken.

The following figures are taken from an experiment (c) (Mar. 3, 1898).
