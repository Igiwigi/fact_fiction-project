But it is evident that all idea
D of symmetry caused by rotation on an axis must be relinquished, when we
E consider that the elliptic form of the inner subdivided portion indicates with
S extreme probability an elevation of that portion above the plane of the rest, s0
5 that the real form must be that of a ring split through half its circumference,
E and having the split portions set asunder at an angle of about 45® each to the
H plane of the other.

S into protuberances, s0 as to render the general outline of the whole nebula, a

form, under which it was imperfectly seen by Mzssttr. To this axis the com-
plete figure is symmetrical, and if we are disposed to regard it as a mass in
rotation, it is about this axis that we must suppose it to revolve. In that case
its real form must be that of an ohlate spheroid; and as it does not. follow that
the brightest portions must of necessity be the densest, this snpposition would
