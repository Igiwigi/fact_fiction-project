the iodine, the division of the element which takes place at the formation of the
bydriodic and iodic acids, is the correlative fact, to explain which we must assume
the same polar difference between its particles (see page 765).

2. In the course of his researches on the hypophosphites, Wurz discovered a very
singular substance, the bydruret of copper*, This substance is formed by the action
of hypophosphorons acid upon copper salts. It readily decomposes, $0 that it is not
easy to determine its constitution, but his analyses very closely corresponded with
the formula Cu, IH. That this is truly the formula of the substance, may be inferred
with yet more certainty than from the analyses, from the following curious reaction.

* Bunzerivs attempted to throw gome doubt upon the existence of this body, but the correctness of the
facts, as stated by Wurz, is guaranteed, not only by the well-known 8kill and ability of this chemist, but also

by the fact that Poacxxporey had succeeded in procuring a hydruret of copper by the electrolysis of the
sulphate of this metal.


768 MR. BRODIE ON THE CONDITION OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS

In contact with strong hydrochloric acid hydrogen is evolved, and the protochloride
of copper, Cuy Cl, formed. Both substances are decomposed, and Wurz satisfied
himself, and gives the experiments, which show that the yolume of the hydrogen
evolved was the double of that due to the simple decomposition of the substance. - I
will add the remark which he makes on this experiment :â€”* On sait que Vacide
