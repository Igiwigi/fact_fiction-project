starlings. Some, except perhaps for a short period when the feathered young filled the
nest-hole, remained every night in their nests, and this type of bird, which never visited
a communal roost at all, appeared to be commoner in the towns than in the country. All
other starlings, however, and these were greatly in the majority, roosted communally every
night from about the middle of May throughout the summer and autumn. In January,
when the gonads reached a certain stage in their growth and the attachment to the nesting
sites became even stronger, the great majority of British birds forsook the communal roosts
and once more spent the nights, often in pairs, in their old nests. This fact was first noticed
by Morley (1939). As the birds retired into the dark holes in the evening when it was still
broad daylight and did not emerge again until, in the morning, it was once more broad
daylight, they were exposed to as much as an hour and a half less light per day than the
birds which continued to roost communally. They also had far less exercise as the flights
to and from the roosting place, which together were often as much as 40 or 50 miles a day,
were eliminated. The very few British starlings which continued to use the communal
roosts throughout February and March appeared to be mainly unpaired adult males and
first-year birds, but occasionally an adult female was also found to be continuing this habit.
By the end of March few adult birds and few first-year females remained to roost com-
munally, but it was found that many pairs of birds living in the immediate neighbourhood
of the roosting place continued to do so (figure 87, plate 21).
