The multi-attractor nature of nonlinear dynamical systems suggests
that the instabilities identified above could lead to new attractors that will constitute a more global
view of the system behaviour than has previously been available.

6. Description of rotor model

It is apparent that the rotor behaviour is very nonlinear and that analysing such a system
numerically necessitates the use of nonlinear analysis methods with a numerical model that
can capture the fold bifurcation seen in the wind tunnel tests. What makes this type of
investigation even more difficult is the fact that the number of parameters involved together
with the different flight manoeuvres and rotor types that need to be considered is large. From an
engineering perspective, it is important to be able to perform numerous quick analyses in order
to minimize the problem dimension to a manageable level. For this reason, it was necessary in
this investigation to create a low-order nonlinear rotor model that nevertheless retains acceptable
fidelity in the aerodynamic and dynamic representations.
