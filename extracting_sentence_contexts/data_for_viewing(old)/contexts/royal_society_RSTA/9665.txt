all days of the 11 years. To avoid decimals the unit employed is 0°001 of the
“ character” unit, as in Table 1V. The associated disturbed day had a “ character”
figure in excess of the normal, except in the one case in which a negative sign appears
in the table. The representative disturbed day is described as day 0, as in Table LV.
The maximum for each pulse is in heavy type.

at times corresponding to the several groups of subsequent days, naturally become
less the longer the period of years dealt with. The fact that the commencing months
of both 1890 and 1901 were all very quiet is also to the advantage of the 11-year
group, as compared with the 6-year group. Still, I should have preferred, but for
considerations of time, to have included quiet as well as disturbed day data for the
11 years, employing the Astronomer Royal’s quiet days for the former.

The data for the previous associated pulse, and the first, second, and third
subsequent associated pulses in Table V. are very fairly smooth; but those for the
fourth associated subsequent pulse seem unduly affected by “ accidental” phenomena,
which depress the entry for day 108 and raise that for day 110. The eleven years
were dealt with in four groups—
