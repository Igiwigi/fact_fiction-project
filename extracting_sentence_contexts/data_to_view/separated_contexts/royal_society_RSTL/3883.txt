When heated with hydrate of baryta the salts of the acid yield marsh-gas, together
with sulphate and snIphite of barium. A method is thus indicated by which pro-
bably all the hydrocarbons, C,,_, H,z, may be prepared from the corresponding
sulpho-acids *,

The simplicity of relation which exists between snIphacetic and disulphometholic
acid, left no doubt in our mind regarding the convertibility of the former into the
latter. We have established this fact moreover experimentally. Sulphacetic acid,
prepared by the action of anhydrous sulphuric acid upon glacial acetic acid, furnished
without difficulty disulphometholic acid, when again treated with sulphuric acid. A
Similar observation had in fact been made already by M. MeLssNs, This chemist, in
his researches upon the sulphacetates, appears in s0me sort to have anticipated the
existence of the disulphometholates.
