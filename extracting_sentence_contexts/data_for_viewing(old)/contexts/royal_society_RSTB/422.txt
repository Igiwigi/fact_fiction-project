Man.

In 1880, 1881 and 1883+ it had been shown by one of us (F. 8.) that these same
muscles (the abductors) were more liable to degenerative changes in cases of organic
disease of the motor nerves of the larynx from the medulla oblongata downwards, and at
the same time that functional disorders of the laryngeal motor apparatus almost exclu-
sively affected their antagonists, the adductors. The explanation of all these different
phenomena presented great difficulties, and, although light was thrown upon them in
very various and unlooked-for ways, it soon became evident that neither clinical and
pathological observations in Man alone, nor experiments upon the peripheral nerve-
mechanism of animals, would suffice to solve all the questions here involved.

Now, the fact just mentioned—viz., that in functional disorders (¢.g., hysterical
aphonia) those motor laryngeal nerve-fibres only which subserve the volitionary func-
tion of the larynx (i.e., phonation) ordinarily suffer, whilst, on the other hand, in
