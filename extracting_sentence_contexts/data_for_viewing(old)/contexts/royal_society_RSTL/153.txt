Some additional Remarks, on the Mode of Hearing in Cases where
the Membrana: Tympant: has been destroyed, By EVERARD
Home, Esq.

After having communicated to this learned Society, the very
curious facts contained in Mr. CooPtR's paper, which prove that
the organ of hearing is capable of receiving all the different im-
pressions of sound, when the membrana tympani has been
destroyed, it may not be improper to explain, from the obser-
vations contained in a former paper on this subject, in what
manner this may take place.

It is there $tated, that any vibrations communicated directly
to the bones of the skull, are as accurately impressed upon
the organ, as through the medium of the membrana tympani.
The office of that membrane is therefore to afford an extended
surface, capable of receiving impressions from the external air,
and of communicating them to the small bones of the ear;
