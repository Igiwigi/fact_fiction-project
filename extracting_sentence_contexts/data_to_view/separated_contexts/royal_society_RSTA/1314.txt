Since weather forecasters have available vastly more
weather information than does the energy system manager, we expect that G represents a strictly
richer ‘information set’ than FY £0(W;:j <k). Consequently, we require G; to be strictly larger
than FY . In fact, if Ge = Fi , the availability of forecasts will offer no advantage over the optimal
control (4; :0 <j <#) computed in §2, since that policy is already guaranteed to be optimal over

all FI -adapted policies. We note that Frjn = Wn and that the tower property of conditional expectation implies that

ELF yea 1Ge] = E [E[Wal G4 11lG]
= E[WilG«]
=F ijk, (3.1)

so that (F;,x:k <n) is a martingale (in k) adapted to the G's for each fixed n € Z. For k <n, let
Dyk = Fijk — Fnye—1 (3.2)

be the k’th martingale difference associated with the martingale (Fy :k<n).
