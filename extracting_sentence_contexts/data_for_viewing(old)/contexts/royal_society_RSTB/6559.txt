422 S. M. MANTON ON STUDIES ON THE ONYCHOPHORA

cuticle is dry, it is impossible for the spermatozoa to reach the external genital opening
directly from the spermatophores, and the problem remains as to “‘how these little
packets of spermatozoa get into the vagina, and then up the uteri, which are always
full of embryos” (SEDGWicK 1885). WitLEy (1898) states that spermatozoa in P.
capensis are “‘probably injected into the body-cavity through the body-wall by the
process described by Whitman as hypodermic injection. In the case of leeches...this has
been satisfactorily observed.” This suggestion has been accepted as a fact by some later
writers, and ZACHER (1933) remarks ‘Der Mechanismus der Begattung ist noch nicht
aufgeklart...bei Peripatopsis capensis...die Spermatophoren sollen die Kérperwand
durchdringen und in die Leibeshéhle gelangen”, but no facts support these speculations.

SEDGWICK (1909) discusses the problem more fully. “It has been suggested that the
spermatozoa make their way from the adherent spermatophore through the body wall
into the body, and so by traversing the tissues reach the ovary; but having regard to
the thickness and toughness of the skin and the absence of any cutaneous secretion
capable of dissolving the coat of the spermatophore, it seems unlikely that this should
occur. We therefore venture to make the suggestion, though we cannot offer any facts
in support of it, except the swallowing of the cuticle..., that the creatures lick the
spermatophores off their bodies or otherwise devour them, and that the sperma-
tozoa are set free in the stomach, and make their way through its soft walls and through
the body cavity to the ovary or receptaculum seminis,”
