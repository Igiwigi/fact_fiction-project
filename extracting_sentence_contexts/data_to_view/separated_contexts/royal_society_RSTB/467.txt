This paper anticipates my own in the following particulars :â€”

In the description of the air-sac. In the description of the branching of the tubes and the way in which the tubes
end. In the fact that the blood is arterial in the heart. In the statement that blood does not circulate between the individual trachee. In the fact that each respiratory arrangement may be considered as a single
organ, and that this organ is intermediate between the tracheal lungs of
Spiders and the true trachee of Spiders.
