16(d’) and (e’) is a reproduction of the
cells shown in fig. 16(d) and (e), turned through 180° about the axis of the cell so that
the walls previously at the back are now visible. The transverse walls are now seen
not to be parallel to the micellar rows ; in fact, in a cylindrical cell, the cross wall
and the micellar direction could only be parallel at one point, and in a cell of
square cross-section only one tangential wall can have micelles oriented parallel to
the cross wall. It seems fairly certain that no exact correlation can exist between
the micellar spiral and the transverse wall. This work of Jaccarp and Frey does, however, impose two conditions on the
mechanism of the development of the micellar spiral.
