tion, however, to the ice 80 formed, observations of late years have Shown that a very
considerable formation of ice takes place along the beds of certain rivers, especially
when those beds are stony and gravelly, In these climates we rarely have the opportunity
of observing this phenomenon on a large scale, although, from a few facts noticed, it
appears even here to be far more common than has been supposed. That this agent is one of considerable power in producing changes of the character
we are referring to, is evident from the facts recorded by ARAGo®, and the experiments
made by M. LrcLercef at Li6ge, and by Colonel Jacks0N in Russia. These observyers
show that most running streams give rise, under certain conditions, on the setting in of

= winter, to the formation of ground-ice, In the first, place the whole body of water be-
S comes reduced, by intermixture caused by the flow of the river, to a uniform temperature
© of 32, Any pointed surfaces in the bed of the river then determine, as is the case with
E a saturated galine s0lution, a sort of crystallization, needles of ice being formed, which
E gradually extend from point to point and envelope the substances with which they are
Sin contact, By this means the whole surface of a gravelly river-bed may become coated
5 2 with i ice, which on a change of temperature, or of atmospheric pressure, or on acquiring
E Zcertain dimensions, rises to the surface, bringing with it all the loose materials to
£ Z which it adhered. A According to M. LrcLERcq, whose observations were made in the winters of 1840 and
= 1841, when the mean temperature of the end of December was 12* Fahr., ground-ice is
S > formed i in a current of 3:60 feet per second on the fifth day; and with a current of 9:52
Z S feet to 11-58 feet, on the ninth to the eleventh day, The greatest depth at which he
2 observed the formation of ground-ice was not quite 4 feet, and the greatest thickness the
Z ice attained was 2:63 feet.
