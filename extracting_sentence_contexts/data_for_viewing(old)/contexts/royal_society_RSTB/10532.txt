towards smaller sizes at maturity with increasing urbanization
is likely important to the success of D. magna in urban ponds, as
the countergradient evolution enables this species to deal with
the higher temperatures in settings that support a phenotypic
shift to larger individuals. Our integrated analysis revealed
striking patterns of body size turnover along urbanization gra-
dients in response to the urban heat island effect, mediated by
evolutionary and non-evolutionary ITV as well as by changes
in the relative abundances of species. Moreover, we detected
a number of surprises and complexities such as the differences
in responses between communities dominated by small versus
large species, the cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics, and the
fact that ITV likely associated with ontogenetic shifts in one
species has a stronger impact on community trait turnover
than shifts in species composition. These complexities need

predictions of trait shifts in the face of environmental change.

Our extended partitioning approach allows combining field
data with detailed quantitative genetic analyses obtained from
common garden experiments. It can be applied to any trait and
provides a highly valuable tool to study eco-evolutionary
