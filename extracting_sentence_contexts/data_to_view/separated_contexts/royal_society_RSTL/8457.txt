This force drives the vessel round in the opposite direction, that is, in the direction
in which the mill is moving. As the velocity diminishes this force diminishes until it
vanishes with the velocity. The fact that, on suddenly removing the light, the deflection of the yessel was never
found as large as when the light was turned on, is easily explained. The mill acquires
the maximum speed in a shorter time than that required to reduce the velocity to zero
when the light is removed. The force acting up to the time of the first elongation is
smaller when the light is remoyed than when it is turned on, and hence the smaller
elongation.
