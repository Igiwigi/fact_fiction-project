Thus I shall suppose = FD INE
then, as above remarked, Z(k, k, k,. k,, k,.)=0 forall values of 9, q, 9.459; and therefore
=k, KERR kk) =03

also Ek, k,k, k, k, k, becomes
ky tg ey (key ee te + 2k ule eg bes Treg + Thy Ty);
and C(z, 7,,7,,7,,) vanishes, except for the cases where 9, 9, qz 9, represent respectively,
9: the index 1 or 4, q, the index 2 or 5, q, the index 3 or 6, and gq, the index 7. Hence Ek, k,,k, kk, kk, k,) =, ks bs ke:C(k bes bes hy),
and consequently 7, becomes
+8C(k, kykes kg) > {hs beg eg + 24r; (fs ee bes eg + beg Beg) }
Hence we are able to predict that the general expression for our - in the case before
us will be

For in the first place, the fact that the 7 vanishes when more than three relations
of equality exist between the K's, proves that we may assume 7, of the form
S{C(k, kk, k,)X6{k, kk ky; ky, ky},
the semicolon (;) separating the Fs into two groups, in respect of each of which
severally @ is a symmetrical form. But if in the expression last aboye written for 7,
we make kh, =kke=hk,* kr=kss
it becomes

Thus, then, wheneyer k, k, k, are respectiyely equal to any three of the quantities
k, ky kh, which, may take place i in twenty-four different ways {twenty-four being the
number of per mutations of four things}, our 7, will haye been correctly assumed ; but
Ek, k,k, k,,) being replaceable by C(h, h, h,,h,), the 7, may be treated as a cubic
function in k,, k,, k,, and arranged according to the powers of k, k, k, will contain
only twenty terms} hence; Since the as8umed form' is\verified/for more than twenty,
7. e. for twenty-four values of /,,,, þ,, it follows that the assumed form is universally

identical with the form of 7, which was to be determined:
