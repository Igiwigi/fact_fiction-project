In particular if a,=0, we have a semi-infinite plate bounded by a straight edge
and containing a circular hole. Suppose that such a plate is in equilibrium under
given normal and tangential forces applied over the boundaries « = a, a, 80 that we
are given over a = a,

If the tractions applied over the circle a = «, are statically equivalent to forces *

Substituting these and the expansions for aa, ap in the expressions for X, Y, L, and

The corresponding components of the resultant of the forces applied over a = a,
can be obtained in a similar way. We must, however, remember that in this case

the forces act from that side of the boundary for which «<«,, whereas in the case
