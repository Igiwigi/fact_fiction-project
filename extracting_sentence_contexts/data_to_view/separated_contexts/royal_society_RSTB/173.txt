But even in these last cases
there was no recovery from the paralysis, although the animals learned to get about
and even to climb the wires of the cage quite readily with the use of their arms, the
legs being always used merely passively as props. The results which follow unilateral removal of the gyrus marginalis are perfectly
well marked, but far less striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able
to assume and maintain a nearly normal attitude; a result due, no doubt, to the action
of the muscles upon the one side of the spine being sufficient for this purpose. Rotation of the trunk to the side opposite to the cerebral lesion appears, however,
to be deficient, and paralysis of the opposite leg is always very distinct; the
foot and leg hanging down when the animal is seated upon a perch, and remaining
passive when the animal is taken up by the shoulders and somewhat rapidly lowered
to the ground. Under these circumstances a normal Monkey will always extend
the hip and put down the foot to meet the ground, but in cases with a unilateral
lesion of this description it is only the foot which is upon the same side as the
cerebral lesion which is thus lowered.
