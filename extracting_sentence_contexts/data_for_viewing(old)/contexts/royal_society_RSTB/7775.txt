Introduction

intelligence and the identification of structure or redundancy in a set of messages (Barlow 1983). This is
shown by considering what is required to do well in an intelligence test: for one type of problem one must
identify a pattern or structure in a series of items, and the solution is obtained by continuing that pattern;
the solution to other problems results from having applied this paradigm in one’s everyday experience.
The second insight is that structure or redundancy (in the information theory sense) constitutes knowl-
edge (Barlow 1996). This follows directly from the fact that both of them define some way in which a set of
messages deviates from complete randomness.

These insights from information theory tell one that intelligence is the process of identifying redun-
dancy, and that knowledge is the store of identified redundancy that this process builds up. This resolves
the paradox, pointed to by Gregory (1987), that one thinks of knowledgeable people as being intelligent,
yet the more knowledge one has, the less intelligence is likely to be needed for solving a problem; he
names these ‘kinetic intelligence’ and ‘potential intelligence’ by analogy with creating and storing
energy, though information is actually related to entropy, not energy. These issues are highly relevant to
the considerable fraction of papers in this volume that use statistical methods to supply some of the knowl-
edge used in vision.

The papers are published in the order in which they were given at the meeting. Richard Gregory first
