74 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

assume this, being convinced that the observations of Professor Rexavir at Autun
are accurate ; that able observer is much too cautious to speak 80 decisively as he has
done respecting the stems of Sphenophyllum for his evidence to be doubted. He has
kindly sent me examples of his stems, and they agree cloely with my own; 80 that
the near affinity of Asterophyllites and Sphenophyllum must now be accepted, not
as a probable hypothesis, but as a determined fact*, It is equally clear that these
stems have no relationship to Calamites. M. Graxp'Eury some time ago arrived
at this conclusion at St. Etienne (se * Comptes Rendus,” tome Ixviii., © Observations
sur les Calamites et les Asterophyllites”) from the 8tudy of their external forms;
Dr. Dawsox has insisted upon the 8ame distinction in the case of his Canadian
specimens. Professor RENAULT writes to me respecting the stems of Sphenophyllum —
< Il serait difficile de yous donner la description des d6tails de structure de ces tiges
curieuses, gui nont jamars rien eu de commun avec les Calamites.” IT am convinced that,
the same conclusion is true in the case of Asterophyllites. To continue to affirm that
these plants were the branches and foliage of Calamites in the face of this combined
testimony of independent obseryers, whose poxsitions have given them opportunities for
forming a judgment on the question, will surely be to stultify all scientific testimony.
But, unfortunately, determining what these plants are not does not tell us what they
