In fact it is now proved that the
Belemnoteuthis (as was originally suggested by Mr. CranxinG Pearce and Mr, Cun-
NINGTON) possessed an osselet of a radiated structure containing a chambered siphun-
culated cone, but without an extended rostrum or guard ; thus forming an interesting
transition to the Belemnite, from which it is generically distinetf. From the facts
before us, our knowledge of the organization of the genus Belemnites comprises the
following structures :â€”

1. The investing periostricum or capsule, which enveloped the osselet, and extend-
ing upwards, constituted the external parietes of the receptacle.

2. 'The Osselet, characterized by its radiated structure, composed of trihedral pris-
matic fibres, which terminated distally in a solid rostrum having an alveolus or conical
hollow to receive the lower portion of the chambered phragmocone, and proximally
in a thin cup-like expansion, which became confluent with the capsule, and formed
the receptacle for the viscera.

3. The Phragmocone, or conical siphunculated chambered internal shell, the apex
of which occupied the alveolus of the rostrum, and the upper part expanded into a
capacious chamber, from the basilar margin of which proceeded two elongated testa-
Cceous Processes.
