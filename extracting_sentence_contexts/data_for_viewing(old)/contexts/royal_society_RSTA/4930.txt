Chromospheric observations of late-type stars also reveal evidence of a ‘basal’ emission
component that appears unrelated to the stellar magnetic activity, covering the entire surface
of magnetically inactive stars (e.g. [41,42]). This basal activity has been interpreted as being
due to acoustic heating (see [42]); however, Bercik et al. [43] indicate that a turbulent dynamo,
from non-rotating plasma, represents a viable alternative to acoustic heating models, and can
reproduce the observed basal coronal (X-ray) and chromospheric (Mg II) flux. Cuntz et al. [44]
have demonstrated that MHD wave heating models using direct stellar magnetic measurements
can successfully heat the chromospheres over a wide range of activity.

The close similarity of the phenomenology of solar and stellar activity constitutes the basis
of the ‘solar-stellar connection’ (e.g. [45,46]). The challenge of the solar-stellar connection is to
investigate the limitations of the solar analogy. In fact, several significant differences in solar and
stellar activity phenomena are also observed, especially going towards the extreme of activity.
Active stars, for example, tend to have large polar spots (e.g. [47-49]), at odds with less active
stars like the Sun. Also, the high level of X-ray emission of active coronae, several orders of
magnitude larger than that of the Sun, cannot be simply reproduced by scaling up the solar
corona, i.e. covering the entire stellar surface with solar active regions (e.g. [50]). We now know
that active stellar coronae differ in at least some aspects from the solar corona, including, for
instance, significantly higher degrees of flaring activity and higher coronal plasma densities
(see §2c).

Since observations of stars ca 1980 with the X-ray observatory EINSTEIN [51], it became clear that
