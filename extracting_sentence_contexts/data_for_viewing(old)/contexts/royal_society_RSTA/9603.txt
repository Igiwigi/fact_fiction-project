itself. That this is chiefly ultra-violet is shown by the fact that when a Jena G.G, 3
filter was introduced the image for 1/20th sec. exposure was too weak for reproduction,
and showed only the carbon tips. This filter has a fairly sharp cut-off about
425 my, transmitting freely above 450 my, and scarcely at all below 400 mu.

Fig. 2 shows the result of a 1-second exposure through the G.G. 3 filter. This
caused over-exposure of the carbons, so that the relative importance of the arc is

exaggerated. To the eye the image of the arc is scarcely visible compared with
those of the carbons. The photographs illustrate the well-known fact that almost
all the visible light comes from the carbons, but most of the ultra-violet from the
cyanogen bands in the arc itself.

It will be seen that the arc length was about 2-7 mm in fig. 1, and 3-2 mm in
fig. 2. The former length is slightly above the minimum (2-5 mm) necessary to
ensure absence of shading, and is almost an ideal length for working ; the latter
is slightly too long, as a long are increases the curvature of the positive carbon end,
and increases also the importance of the ultra-violet radiation from the arc, which
is probably more affected by slight variations in the purity of the carbons than is
the light from the carbon tip.

The photographs show that the positive tip was about 3-5 mm in diameter.
