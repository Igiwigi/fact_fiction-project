interval between the bands seen in the spectrum is equal to the interval between the
bands formed by the interference of two streams of light, of the colour censidered,
coming from a luminous line seen in focus, and entering the object-glass through
two very narrow slits parallel to the axis of y, and situated in the middle of the two
interfering streams respectively. 'This affords a ready mode of remembering and
calculating the best thickness of plate for a given aperture, or the best aperture for a
given thickness of plate.

17. According to the preceding explanation, no bands would be formed in Sir Dayip
BrewszeR's experiment when the plate was held on the side of the spectrum on
which the red was seen. Mr. Airy has endeavoured to explain the existence of bands
under such cireumstances*. Mr. Airy appears to speak doubtfully of his explanation,
and in fact to offer it as little more than a conjecture to account for an observed
phenomenon. In the experiments of Mr. TaiBor and Mr. Airy, bands appear to have
been seen when the retarding plate was held at the red side of the spectrum ; whereas
Sir Davip BrewsrTER has stated that he has repeatedly looked for the bands under
these circeumstances and has never been able to find the least trace of them ; and he
considers the bands seen by Mr. TaLBor and Mr. Airy in this case to be of the
nature of Newrox's rings. While 80 much uncertainty exists as to the experimental
cireumstances under which the bands are seen when the retarding plate is held at the
red side of the spectrum, if indeed they are seen at all, it does not seem to be de-
sirable to enter into speculations as to the cause of their existence.
