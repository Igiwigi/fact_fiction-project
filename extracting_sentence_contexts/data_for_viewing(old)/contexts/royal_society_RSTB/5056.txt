colony, from which the piece was taken, was

probably from the Maldives, well preserved, 0
consisting of a continuous, though comparatively â€œo,
small, polystomodeeal polyp. .The second piece Oy
(115 y I, 22 mm. in diameter) was taken from a

colony, from Rotuma, consisting of a median
region and two pairs of lateral lobes.

The invariable presence of one or two
mesenterial strands connecting neighbouring
stomodea is a highly significant fact which
suggests that intra-tentacular budding in
Symphyllia takes place in some such manner
as is represented in the figs. 244, B and c.
Fig. 24 is a monostomodal polyp in which
an intra-tentacular diverticulum is being formed
between mesenteries 1, and 2,, stomodeum I
being the stomodzeum of the polyp. In fig. 248
stomodeeum IT has been formed in the diverti-
culum which has thus become a bud, and the
two principal mesenteries 1, and 2, have been
bent towards it in such a manner that they
have joined stomodsum II at their bents; the
