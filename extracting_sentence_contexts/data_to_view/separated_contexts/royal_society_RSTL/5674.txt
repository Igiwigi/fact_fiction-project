The accumula-

D a purely functional phenomenon, and, like a blush upon the cheek, becomes obliterated
[= after death by the post-mortem contractions of the vessels: inflammatory congestion, on
'5 the contrary, is the first evidence of organic lesion, and declares itself as distinctly in
2 the dead as in the living, being the most important if not the only sign of the early

Z Pient meningitis mentioned in the Introduction to this paper.
ij Although determination of blood, as met with in the frog, is thus entirely inde-

g pendent of inflammatory congestion, yet it is of great interest with reference to human
& inflammation. Dilatation of the arteries is now generally admitted to be the result of
© the relaxation of their muscular fibres; and that it is a purely passive phenomenon,
S seems to be absolutely demonstrated by the fact which I have pointed out elsxewheref,
S that after the vessels have been liberated from the control of the neryous system by
@ rTemoryal of the spinal cord, they dilate fully if the heart continues to act sufficiently
