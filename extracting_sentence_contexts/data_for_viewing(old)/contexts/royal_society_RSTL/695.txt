The Royal Society did me the honour to insert, in the last
volume of their Transactions, a paper of mine, in which I gave
a new method of solving all functional equations of the first
order, and of a certain class by means of elimination, and I
there stated that all solutions so obtained were only par-
ticular cases of the general solutions, and that they did not
contain any arbitrary function,

Now it may be observed, that there are certain forms which
may be assigned to the coefficients which render those solu-
tions apparently infinite, yet that on farther consideration it
appears, that the solution is in fact a vanishing fraction : in all
such cases the. process I have just pointed out will give the
real s0lution which will contain an arbitrary function, so that
it is in fact a general solution. Thus in the equation vw + fiv.
