A similar effect can be brought about
in a shorter time by keeping sections of the chlorogogenous tissue in absolute alcohol
or in a mixture of absolute alcohol and ether maintained at 55Â°C. After three days
of such treatment with warm absolute alcohol the granules are paler in colour than
when fresh ; many are still yellow, but others are colourless or almost so. On the
fourth day the granules exhibit a tendency to break up; some of them are, in fact,
