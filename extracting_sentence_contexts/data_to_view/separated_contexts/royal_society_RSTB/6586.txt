SUMMARY

A description is given of the features of forty-four brains of Australian aborigines,
which was undertaken in the attempt to discover the existence of racial features. The different regions are classified in a more or less arbitrary manner to facilitate
comparison with the brains of other races. Many interesting and suggestive facts
emerge. In the lateral occipital region the general pattern of the sulci, together
with other features, shows two distinct methods of folding of the striate cortex, one
horizontal and one vertical. In the horizontal foldings various forms of sulcus
lunatus are revealed, whereas in the vertical foldings this sulcus is not so commonly
found, but the intrastriate sulci are disposed in an almost stereotyped manner.
