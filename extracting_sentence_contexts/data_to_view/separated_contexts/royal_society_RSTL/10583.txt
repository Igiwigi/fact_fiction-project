In Experiment IX. the surface tension of the black film, also balanced
against another, which showed the blue of the second order, was in excess by 1'5 per
cent. r

In all cases where the same experiment has furnished two results they make dT of
opposite 8igns, thereby indicating that the difference between the two films is not due
to the fact that one is thicker than the other. "The results are summed up in the following table â€”
