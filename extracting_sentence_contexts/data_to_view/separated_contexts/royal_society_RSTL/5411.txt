MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 435
We find as the equation of the locus,
(1-10) (+4 +2Y*+61(1—30P—167)(a*+5* +2) xyz
+6P(1—104P— 320)a%*2?
—2(1+8ÞY(yo+22%+2%)=0,

where the function on the left-hand side is the octicovariant ©,U of my Third Memoir.
the covariant having been in fact defined 80 as to satisfy the condition in question. And I have given in the memoir the following expression for ©, U, viz.

Joe we have

CROTEE I EA en I
It will be convenient to represent the equation of the cubic by the abbreviated notation
$1, 1, 1, !Xs, y, 2Y=0; we have the two equations

= (1, LL; IX2,.9,.2Y=0,

E Er+ny + =O

Znd if to these we join a linear equation with arbitrary coefficients,
V er+PBy+y2=0,

Zhen the second and third equations give

- substituting these values in the first equation, we obtain the resultant of the system.
