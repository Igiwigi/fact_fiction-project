From the above it is evident that the cartilaginous rings consisting in their waist
portions of vertebral rings and in their end portions of pro- and opistho-spondylous zones,
represent formations homologous with the primary vertebral bodies of Struthio.

It is of interest to notice that the ventral and ventro-lateral portions of the opistho-
spondylous zone are slightly stronger than the corresponding portions of the prospon-
dylous zone. The dorsal and lateral regions of the pro- and opistho-spondylous rings
show equal strength (fig. 19, ps.z., 08.2.).

The dorsal and ventral walls of the vertebral body in sagittal section show equal
longitudinal extension, but their respective thickness is different, the ventral wall being
slightly thicker than the dorsal. ‘This is a consequence of the fact that the dorsal portion
of a vertebral centrum persists in the condition of a primary vertebral body, while
the ventral and ventro-lateral portions, being fused with portions of the caudal and
cranial sclerotomites (respectively dorsal and ventral arcualia), represent those of a typical
secondary vertebral body.*

* The “primary” vertebral body thus consists of the bare centrum, a section of the continuous
perichordal tube ; the secondary vertebral body of this centrum with the fused arcualia added to it.
