The Associated Transformation.—We represent the %* quadrics of ® on the primes

* The homaloidal system of quadrics in question seems to have been first noticed by Brancur in con-
nection with his work on elliptic integrals of the first kind [‘ Math. Ann.,’ Bd. 17 (1880)] ; and it is one of
those obtained by Deu Pxzzo in his paper already quoted. Also since writing the following account of the
associated transformation, I have learned of the existence of a recent paper by Dorr. ANronto GENNARO
on this very transformation. I have thought best, however, not to alter anything in my account of the
matter. The reference in question, for which I have to thank Mr. F. P. Wurre, is ‘Ann. Seuola Norm.
Pisa,’ 15 (1927), last article. .

+See G. Marverra, ‘ Rend. Palermo,’ vol. 19, p. 101 (1905). More generally, it is true that a rational
CULVE C241 of order 2m + 1, in [2m], has one (m + 1)-secant [m — 1]. This follows from the fact that
 Com+1 of [2m + 1] has one (m +- 1)-secant [m] passing through an arbitrary point not on the curve.

} That is, we assume for quadries, and r = 4, k = 1, the theorem that if r — k primis of the same order

U, =0, ..., Ur-~ = 0 intersect in a locus of dimension & without multiple points, then every primal of

this order through the locus has an equation of the form
AU, +... + Ape Up = 0.
