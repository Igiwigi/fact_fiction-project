Certainly in my
experience, even in the case of markedly bacterial-eating Protozoa, like Bodo,
Monas, or the Amoebee, however great their multiplication is, it has little or no
practical influence upon the numbers of the Bacteria present. Conditions that
favour the Protozoan development invariably favour the bacterial development ;
3 but the converse does not by any means always hold. For instance, especially in
& old cultures, I have not infrequently failed to get any Protozoan activity worth
s mentioning on again sub-culturing, although the bacterial development has been
qa as usual,
iB} One very important biological fact which does not appear to me to have been
é taken sufficiently into account in the discussion of this subject is that the Protozoa
a (at all events, the Flagellates and Amcebee) are themselves markedly affected by the
(a) Bacteria. (The soil-Bacteria being the special object of solicitude, the question has

always been as to what action the Protozoa have upon them.) Now, as Croprrr
and Drew showed in the case of Amcebee, and as Lapace and I have indicated
in the case of Helkesimastix, the Bacteria on their side exert, either directly or
indirectly, an important, indeed a vital, influence upon the life-history of these and,
doubtless, other coprozoie Protozoa.

Starting with the commencement of the cycle of activity, what is the first thing
that happens in a freshly made culture (or sub-culture), or, to put the matter in other
words, when the environment in which are the encysted Protozoa and the spores of
the Bacteria (or their quiescent stages) is altered—diluted and purified—by the
