COLLAPSE OF FLUID COLUMNS 295

We have already explained in § 2 that if the radius vector to the interface R is expanded
in terms of only the even harmonics, then for any finite expansion, the interface must meet
the ground vertically. On the other hand, it is not necessary in the numerical work to
expand R only in even harmonics, and then the interface will not in general be vertical at
the point where it meets the ground. Arguments can in fact be advanced to show that the
interface must ultimately make an angle of }7 with the ground. We are indebted to Professor
Harold Jeffreys for demonstrating this result and for permission to quote his argument. A similar proof has already been given independently by von Karman (1940) in connexion
with ‘gravity currents’.
