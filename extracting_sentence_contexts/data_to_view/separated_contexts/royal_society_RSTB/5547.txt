But apart from these examples,
freshwater fishes manage to keep their places without sucking-discs.” Kyte has
used this as an argument to prove that structures do not arise and develop on account
of their utility. In the following summary I shall indicate that all the hill-stream fishes
that live on rocks in rushing waters are provided with adhesive discs, and the obvious
utility of these devices is clearly indicated by the fact that the degree of development
of an adhesive apparatus is directly correlated with the rate of flow of the current. Indeed, it seems impossible that any animal should be able to keep its place in
tempestuous waters without an adequate means of fixation. KYLE (p. 269) has observed that “In the rapid streams of the Himalayas the
Anabantoids use their movable spine to anchor themselves to stones.”
