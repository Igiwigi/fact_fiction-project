semantic memory, of a novel episodic representation—is itself an instance of
a statistical, in fact associative, process. The article concludes that the same pro-

of representations that correspond to individual tokens, and of novel episodic
facts about those tokens. Statistical learning is a window onto these deeper
processes that underpin cognition. This article is part of the themed issue ‘New frontiers for statistical learning
