It will be noticed that every time the film was disturbed the value of r fell, i.
the specific conductivity of the film was reduced more nearly to that of the liquid i
mass, nor was this merely due to the fact that the first effect of the currents was 1
every case to thicken the film, the value of 7 corresponding to a given thickness
always less in a more recently disturbed film. This is proved by comparing th
values of 7 corresponding to 320 .n. in groups (3) and (2), and those correspondit
to 388 p.m. in groups (5) and (2).
