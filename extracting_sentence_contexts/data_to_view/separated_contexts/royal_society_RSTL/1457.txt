It may
possibly be thought, that this supposed action of the auxiliary
spring which retards the balance while it describes the arc from
N to O, cannot take place, because by the peculiar construction
of Mr. Munce's invention, when the balance vibrates from B
towards E, the retarding force of the auxiliary spring is re-
moved from acting on the balance while it describes the arc
Nk=@27* (fig. z.), including the said are NO; but it is to be
considered, that this removal of the retarding force from

acting on the balance while it describes the arc from N to þ, is
merely a mechanical expedient for supplying the power which
is lost by friction, and as it is thus wholly employed and coun-
teracted, it appears requisite, in making calculations of the
times in which the balance vibrates, that the entire forces of
the springs are to be taken into the calculation in the same
manner as if friction did not exist, and no mechanical contri-
vance was necessary-for compensating the loss of motion in
consequence of it. But since, in point of fact, no retarding
force acts on the balance while it describes the arc N O, ac-
cording to the conditions under consideration, it may be satis-
factory to calculate the time of a semivibration in the arc
B O on this ground also, that is, on a supposition that the
entire semiarc B O is described by the joint accelerative forces
of the balance spring, and the auxiliary spring u only; it will
appear that this slight variation of the conditions does not
at all affect the conclusions deduced from the preceding calcula-
tions, and very little alters the results themselves. The time of describing the semiarc BO, on these conditions,
will be determined by referring to the theorem (page 141),
and making the following notations. a = 1.570796g = an arc of go* to radius = 1
b—2.3361945 = an arc of 195?

c= 2.37364,78 = an arc of 136?

d= 0.0174533 = an arc of 1*.
