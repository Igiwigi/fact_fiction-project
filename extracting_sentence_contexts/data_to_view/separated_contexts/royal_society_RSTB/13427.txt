When we first conducted this
analysis in March 2020, we calculated the population-level
reproduction number as the unweighted mean of the individ-
ual reproduction numbers, which led to smaller attributable
fractions to groups. Ideally, we would have constructed a
who-infected-whom matrix, but the SCS did not contain the
age of contacts. Instead, to capture the fact that highly con-
nected individuals contribute more to the reproduction
number than less well-connected individuals, we used the indi-
vidual reproduction numbers as a weight with which to
calculate a weighted mean of reproduction numbers. This analysis was conducted before genomic sequencing
could be used to quantify the role of superspreading and
large events. In a phylogenetic analysis of cases in the
Boston area, USA [19], 29% of cases were reported to be
responsible for 85% of secondary infections.
