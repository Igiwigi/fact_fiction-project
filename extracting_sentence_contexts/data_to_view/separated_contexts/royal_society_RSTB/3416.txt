The steles of the Sphenophyllums were almost invariably triarch, and it
is now evident that the same was the case in some Calamites. The latter often had
tetrarch steles, however, and this observation is in accord with the frequent observa-
tion of three and four vascular bundles in the cones of Calamostachys Binneyana by
Mr. Hicxuine.ยง Though in none of the young twigs has any centripetal wood been
observed (and in the specimen figured on Plate 3, fig. 6, there appears to be no room
for any), yet the fact that the xylem forms a solid mass at the nodes, while a solid
pith is often present in the internodes, may be taken as further indications of the
former existence of centripetal xylem. Both the above are, however, very slender
bases for a Sphenophyllum affinity. When we consider the leaves, we see at once that in type and structure they are
typically microphyllous.
