the giant fibre is probably correlated with the semi-fluid and yielding character of the
axis cylinder (see p. 445).

The structure of the contents of the giant fibres of Halla is very similar to that of
the axis cylinder of a medullated nerve fibre of a, Vertebrate as described by
Moncxperc and Berue (1899), except that in the former there is nothing comparable
to the Ranvier's nodes of the latter. The original view of Leypre thus receives full
and striking confirmation, namely, “dass diese mittlere Substanz dem Achsencylinder
entspricht . . . kann nicht in Zweifel gezogen werden ” (1864, p. 155).

The branches of the giant fibre, the arrangement and general structure of which are
described on pp. 472, 473, are extremely difficult to investigate with regard to their
fibrillar contents, owing to the fact that their course is so seldom straight, but is
curved or sinuous, so that only rarely is a good view of a branch obtainable for a
sufficient length to permit the very critical observations required. Consequently all
that I am able to state is that in several cases (but in Gomparatively very few
considering the thousands of sections examined) one or a few (generally the latter)

extremely slender fibrils were seen in the protoplasmic axis of these branches (fig. 29).
As already explained (p. 473), this protoplasmic axis is traceable to the ventral or
ventro-lateral region of the fibrous part of the cord, where it becomes lost to view.
