In the case of celestial mechanics, that is (in units where
the gravitational constant equals one), V;;(q) = —mjmj;/|\lq\|, there are collisions for n> 2, and : =
non-collision singularities for n > 4, see [5-7] and §2. Moreover, as shown in [8] for d=1 and 3
n=4 there are initial conditions which (after regularization of binary collisions) do not lead to :
singularities but for which limy—. +00 ||q(t, Xo) ||/t = 00, so that asymptotic velocity (1.3) does not nee)
exist (see also [9]). :

Conversely, for n < 4 celestial bodies asymptotic velocities exist for all initial conditions. This [4
follows from von Zeipel’s theorem and the fact that j*(x) < 00 for n < 3, see theorem 2.6. DN
