than do the yolk spheres proper (vide infra).

Similar spherules, presenting the appearance of having been recently discharged
from the nucleolus, are also occasionally, though much more rarely, to be found in the
growing oocyte. Fig. 24 shows a stage prior to the commencement of yolk formation,
in which a group of deeply basophile spherules, almost as large as those seen in the
adult egg, stand in direct relation to the peripheral and slightly projecting de-stained
area of the nucleolus. F ig. 18 is taken from material in which the nucleolus, as
also the chromatin, shows a much stronger basophile affinity ; it represents a still
younger egg, in which a stream of spherules is in the act of being discharged
from the nucleolus, though the latter is so intensely basophile that extraction has
not sufficed to differentiate a less intensely basophile internal region. The special
interest of this section lies in the fact that, owing to the eccentric position of the
nucleolus and the outward direction of the discharge, the stream of spherules already
lies well in the cytoplasm, while still retaining its obvious spatial relation to the
nucleolus.

The fact that this appearance of a discharge of spherules from the nucleolus should
be so rarely seen in the growing oocyte admits of very simple explanation. In the
growing egg the intermittent discharges must be separated from one another by a
considerable interval,* while the time occupied by the actual discharge must be very
brief. The chances, therefore, against the moment of discharge coinciding with that
of fixation are very great. In the adult egg, on the other hand, the great frequency
with which the discharge is seen cannot be explained as due to its more frequent
occurrence, for this would indicate a degree of activity on the part of the nucleolus at
