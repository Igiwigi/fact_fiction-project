For instance:

Figure 1. Droodle—what is it?

‘output’ as indicative of the general power of human con-
sciousness, rather than merely a semi-reliable marker of its
instantaneous imbalance, would be myopic. We know, anecdotally, that people’s volatility of experi-
ence is a fact of life. Any attempt to measure this volatility
experimentally is all but impossible, and so, the goal of
explaining it scientifically is postponed or, more often, utterly
ignored. Another reason why the hard question is seldom asked is
related to Richard Power’s point about our lack of access to
the properties of the medium of conscious experience.
