expectation has not been fulfilled. There were two theories to account for these storms—one, due to FrrReEn, that a
cyclone consisted of a current of warm ascending air at the centre, which current
drew in the air from neighbouring districts and, aided by the directive force of the
earth’s rotation, produced the characteristic whirl; the other, due I think to
Dr. Hann, was that they were eddies in the general circulation, just as small water
eddies are formed in a swiftly flowing stream. The facts brought to light by
registering balloons do not, so far as Europe is concerned, favour either hypothesis. The cyclone is cold, not warm, and the strong upper westerly current in which the
