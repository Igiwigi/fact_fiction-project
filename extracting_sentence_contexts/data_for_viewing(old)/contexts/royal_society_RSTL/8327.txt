are leaflets of a Pecopteris of the type of P. Serlii, none of the pinnules of fronds of
which type are constructed on the plan of figs. 13 & 14. I am therefore now inclined
to conclude that Rachiopteris aspera (as T propose provisionally to designate the petioles
just described) is a Sphenopteris. It is an important fact in reference to this question,
that we haye in the Coal-measures a Sphenopteris with a tuberculated rachis, and which
has a wide geographical range. This. is the S. Zoeninghaus! already referred to. The


pinnules of this plant exhibit aspects which resemble those of figs. 13 & 14 in the
closest manner, rendering the conclusion that our Oldham fossil is generically, if not
specifically, identical with the above plant, an exceedingly probable one.

The acceptance of this conclusion demonstrates two facts connected with the Carbo-
niferous ferns :—first, that their vascular bundles are not necessarily, like those of
living ferns, surrounded by a definite investing cylinder of prosenchyma; and, secondly,
that the prosenchymatous fibres of their snbepidermal tissues (the sclerenchyma of
authors) do not, as in recent ferns, constitnte an uninterrupted investing layer, but
that it is broken up into a network of fibrous bands arranged longitudinally, and
through the long narrow meshes of which some of the parenchymatous cells of the
S middle bark reach the epidermal surface. We shall find these two facts of importance,
© throwing light upon some other examples awaiting examination.
