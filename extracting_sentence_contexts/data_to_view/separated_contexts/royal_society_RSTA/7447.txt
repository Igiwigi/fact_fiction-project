The beginning of the Lower Carboniferous
period was marked by a gradual marine transgression. However, most of Wales and the
Midlands remained a land area until well on into the Lower Carboniferous, and it seems
possible that the land-mass stretched north as far as Derbyshire, since the oldest Lower
Carboniferous deposits there do not seem to be much earlier than the zone of S, (Cope 1949). In North Wales the deposits are of the epi-continental sea type, the shoreline lying not far
to the south, as evinced by the fact that the basement beds occupy only the hollows in the
Lower Palaeozoic synclines. In the early part of the Lower Carboniferous the sea was bounded
to the north by the rigid Lower Palaeozoic block of north-west Yorkshire, the shoreline
lying along the Craven Fault. South of the shoreline lay the deepest part of the sea in which
