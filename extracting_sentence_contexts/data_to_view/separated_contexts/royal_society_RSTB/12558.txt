Kinet ( r) =

where r:= | x(t) — x(t)|. The constants of integration C;, Co,
C3, Cy € R have then to be estimated in order to guarantee
(i) the continuity of the potential Ki"(r) and (ii) the fact that
it is essentially negligible for large enough interparticle
distances (ie. lim K(r) = 0). Both conditions are in fact
necessary hypotheses for Theorem 4.1, as clearly stated in
[48]. By simple algebraic calculations, we have that C4 can
be taken equal to 0 and the other constants result
