tubes (fig. 9, 7) alternating with murally disposed masses of cells, n, constituting the
primary or secondary-phloem rays. The tubes have a mean diameter y3'g9 = 00031
of an inch. Of course it is to be presumed that these tubes may be regarded as
representatives of the sieve-tubes of the higher Phanerogams, but I can detect in
them no traces of transverse septa, or of any structural peculiarities justifying my
affirming that they are actually sieve-tubes. It must be remembered that we are
equally unable to verify the identity of the similar tubes in the phloem of the
Selaginellee with the true sieve-tubes of Ferns and of the Phanerogams.*

Plate 21, fig. 10, represents a tangential section of the phloem of our plant. We
here see that the tubes, /, just described, display a tendency towards an undulating
arrangement, the spaces between the curves of which enclose horizontally disposed
lines of cells. I have already called attention to the fact that transverse sections

like Plate 21, fig. 4, C, seem to indicate some disposition on the part of these phloem
tubes to arrange themselves in radial lines,

Radial sections of the inner cortex (Plate 23, fig. 9, p) exhibit no peculiarities in
the form and arrangement of its parenchymatous cells requiring special notice, except
