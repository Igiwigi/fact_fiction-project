Harriry,* discussing the fluted flame
spectrum of silver, puts an idea of ScHusrer’s (‘ Brit. Assoc. Report,’ 1880) into the
following words :—‘ Thus we see that there is really no essential difference between
the constitutions of the matter which enters into vapours of metals and metalloids ;
there is, in fact, something in their constitution common to both which is apparently
dependent upon their vapour pressures, and probably due to the actions of the
molecules upon one another when their mean path is so extended that their motions
become rhythmical. Reduce the freedom of their motions and the result is a
continuous spectrum.” The results of the present experiments bear out this conclusion, and the develop-
ment of the banded into a continuous spectrum is regarded as the outcome of the
widening of the individual bands.
