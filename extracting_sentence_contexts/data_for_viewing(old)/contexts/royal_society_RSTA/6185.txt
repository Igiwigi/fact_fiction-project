In equation (3.5), the hydrodynamic stress tensor, i.e. T#) takes its usual form, i.e. Vvj+ (Vvj)
and the dimensional form of the Maxwell stress tensor, i.e.T, (compared with [22]), is given
by T = ceyEE— 3€€0E - EL, where E = —V yz is the electric field, € is the relative permittivity of
the fluid and €9 is the permittivity of free space. The normal component of the Maxwell stress in

2This is the implication mentioned earlier. As the critical amplitude and wavelength are determined by knowing the
properties, it follows that a comparison of experimental critical amplitude with the predicted critical amplitude will yield the
interfacial tension, provided the critical amplitude is, in fact, sensitive to the interfacial tension. This implies that the natural
frequency needs to be sensitive to the interfacial tension. We believe that this can be achieved in the case of electrostatic
forcing by suitably adjusting the DC voltage, whereas it is difficult to do so in the mechanical Faraday forcing without going
to microgravity.


dimensionless form can be written as follows:

(TM +n) n= S102 mY — (Vn YL, (3.7)

where D = €eyA?/H)1U. For the case of a perfect conductor-dielectric model, there are no
tangential components of the Maxwell stress tensor that make a contribution (compared with
(22).
