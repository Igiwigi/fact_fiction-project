revealed the presence of weighable quantities of gold after a lapse of the first
hours, while a sample withdrawn at the end of a second period of three hours did n
indicate the presence of a commensurate amount of the precious metal. This
either pointed to defects in the method, to the transmission of gold by convecti
curreuts, or to the very rapid diffusion of gold when minute quantities of this

are present in lead. I believe that the latter will ultimately prove to afford the
explanation of the facts observed. The vertical tubes were then replaced by U-tubes of wrought iron, each limb
which was 230 millims. long and 10 millims.
