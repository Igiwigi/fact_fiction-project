0:4 millim., or even less. All alike show the characteristic structure of the cortex,
which distinguishes these petioles from that of any other known plant, with the
exception of Lyginodendron, from which they can be separated by the characters
mentioned in the last paragraph. In some of the specimens the branching of the
petioles is shown. Plate 26, fig. 23, represents a small portion of one of the prepara-
stions in question, but gives only an imperfect idea of the complexity of the mass of
foliage which it contains. Sections of leaflets are found among the petioles, and are
sometimes in connection with their finer branches. The structure of the leaflets is
never well preserved, but the form of the sections indicates a decided resemblance to
the leaflets of Lyginodendron,
8 Although the evidence available does not admit of our attempting any detailed
reconstruction of the form of the Heterangiwm leaf, yet one conclusion of great
importance follows with certainty from the facts observed. The leaf of H, Grievii
emust have been a highly compound one, with a much branched rachis, bearing
*8 numerous small leaflets. In other words, the foliage of our plant was certainly of a
4 Fern-like character, and was totally different from any leaves known among the

3 Our knowledge of the Sette of the leaf is practically limited to that of the
£ petiole and its branches. It is true that in some of the preparations from the
Dulesyate specimens beautiful sections of leaflets are shown.t Unfortunately,
however, these preparations contain specimens of Lyginodendron, as well as of
3 Heterangium, so it is impossible to decide for certain to which plant the leaflets
6 belong.

The sections of the petiole are not equal to those of Lyginodendron, but the chief
