plant as it is.

At the opening of the first Memoir,} it was assumed for the purposes of the
discussion that “ whatever may have been the circumstances which led to it, antithetic
alternation was brought about by elaboration of the zygote, so as to form a new
generation, the sporophyte, interpolated between successive gametophytes, and that
the neutral generation is not in any sense the result of modification or metamorphosis
of the sexual, but a new product, having a distinct phylogenetic history of its own.”
Though not actually proved, that mode of origin seemed to me in 1893 to be highly
probable, and I now see no reason to change that view. But as the question has
since been raised afresh, whether this alternation did not arise by modification of
homologous generations,§ it has been found necessary to deal once more with alternation
in the light of the many new facts which have been acquired bearing on the question ;
this was done in an Address to Section K of the British Association in 1898.|| The
most notable paper published on the subject since 1893 is that by SrraspurceR,T

who, following on the suggestion of OvErron,** as to the importance of reduction of
number of the chromosomes in the dividing nucleus as a differentiating character of
the alternating generations, has drawn together many isolated observations of the
