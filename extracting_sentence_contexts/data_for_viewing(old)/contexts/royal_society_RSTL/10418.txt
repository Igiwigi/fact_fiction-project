such a form of digestion in the sponges has Jong been a familiar fact, and the more recent
researches of MeTSCHNIK OFF, CLAUS, GEGENBAUR, PARKER and Ray LANKESTER have
shown that an essentially similar mode of digestion occurs in the adults of many

Colenterata belonging to the higher groups, namely : in Zydra, Hydroid polyps,
Hydromeduse, Acalephs, Actinize, Ctenophora and Siphonophora. MerscaxIKorr
showed in 1878 that the same remarkable process takes place in a number of fresh
water Turbellaria, and he has ascribed to it an important phylogenetic significance. He

points out the fact that intra-cellular or amoboid digestion is confined, 80 far as known,
to the most primitive groups of the Metazoa and in the Cotenterates seems to be
the normal and most frequent if not the only process. The digestive functions of an
entoderm cell in these cases are identical with those of a unicellular Protozoa, and
MErsCHNIKOFF is inclined to consider the former as an actual survival of the latter—a
physiological character which was originally present in all Metazoa then existing, and
has only been lost in higher forms. LANKEsTER even 8uggests that the absorption of
unsaponified fats in the highest Metazoa may possibly be a las relic of the primitive
mode of digestion.
