3 These lead to the numerical results :

S ty == 8259, Tg = — 0572.

Fg The conclusions to be drawn from these results are all of some interest. In the first
&-place we may ask: How does M, agree with its value found from other and more
“= complete series? For 4677 mares—my complete series without mares with alternative
¢ sires—the average fecundity was ‘6373. A better agreement could not have been
Bhoped for. In a group of 1509 mares dealt with for variation only and entered as
3 “ daughters” on the cards—so that they had not been selected by the fact that their

daughters must have recorded offspring, as is the case with “dam” entries—I found
& the following results :—
