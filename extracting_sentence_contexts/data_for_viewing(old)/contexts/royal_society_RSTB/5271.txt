parents, or, in other words, a modification of the original types. These for the most
part afterwards breed true, and they are also stable in the sense that crosses between
them immediately segregate into the same two types that crossed.

As regards the inheritance of the dominant red bud colour of Oe. rubricalyx, it has
already been pointed out that both the reciprocal triple hybrids here described as well
as all of their descendants had red buds. This must mean that they are homozygous
for the red factor, which differentiates rubricalyx from rubrinervis, and which arose as
a dominant gene mutation in 1907 (see Gares 1915a). Now, as has already been stated,
the particular F; family of Oc. biennis x rubricalyx which was used in making these
crosses contained 12 R plants: 1 7. This approximates to the 15 : 1 ratio for two
duplicate factors and suggests that the plant of this F; family was heterozygous for two
factors for red. This is borne out by the fact that in earlier experiments with
rubricalyx (GATES, 1915b), different families gave 15 : 1, 3.: 1, and also in some cases
unexplained 5: 1 ratios. The evidence indicates that a two-factor hypothesis rather
than a differential rate of pollen tube growth is necessary to explain the results. Now

if the plant in question were heterozygous for two factors for red, then some of the
plants in its offspring would be homozygous for two such factors.
