In this scenario, the sex chromo-
chromosomes, it is important to compare syntenic maps of some-autosome fusions could become especially favourable,
different species which have experienced sex chromosome-â€” because sex chromosomes are characterized by decreased
autosome fusions in the evolution of their karyotypes. It is recombination rates. Besides the fact that parts of Y and W
known that in therian mammals and birds, the vertebrate chromosomes do not recombine at all, X and Z chromosomes
groups with most extensively studied chromosomal diversity, also have decreased recombination rates at the population level,
such fusions are rare and the sex chromosomes are among the because they recombine in only half the generations. It might

because sex chromosome-autosome fusions are generally less global crossover rates, would also act to decrease recombination
frequent in ZZ/ZW systems than in XX/XY systems [14].
