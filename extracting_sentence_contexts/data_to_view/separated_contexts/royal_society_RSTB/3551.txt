Owing to the lack of absolute proof of continuity with the vegetative parts,
Yezostrobus must be named and considered separately. Its salient features were
described on p. 33. Its chief interest lies in the fact that it bore seeds in a cone,
which seeds were massive and organised like those of Cycads, and at the same time
had a nucellus.free from the integument right down to the base. The seed itself,
indeed, was like that of the Paleozoic 7rigonocaipus, while it was borne on what
seems to have been a simple scale, with only one seed on it. It will be remembered
that the supposed vegetative parts have no likeness to Araucaria, a genus with
which the single-seeded scale might suggest comparison.
