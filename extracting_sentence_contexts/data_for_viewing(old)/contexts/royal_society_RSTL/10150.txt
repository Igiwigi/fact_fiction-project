records differences considerably in excess of those observed by W1Ls0n and by WELLs. Keeping the
action of aqueous yapour in view, the elaborate paper of Mr. G1ai8HER might repay further discnssion,

Werrs, * appeared on the two nights of the greatest cold I have ever observed on
surface of the earth, relatively to the temperature of the air, both of them ha;
occurred after a long tract of dry weather.”* This evidence is specially valuable j
view of the fact that WeLLs knew nothing of the action of water vapour on radia;
heat. On another occasion he observed a difference of 94 degrees between the '
perature of the air and that of wool placed upon the earth, without any depoxition of |
dew whatever upon the chilled wool.+ He snpplements these obseryations by one
equally important in the opposite direction, © On the night,” he writes, © which
afforded the most copious dew ever observed by me, the cold possessed by the gras.
beyond that of the air was for the most part only 3? and 49.” The smallness of the.
refrigeration in this instance, and the copiousness of the dew, I refer to one and the.
same cause ; namely, the abundance of vapour. Heavy dew implies this abundance ;
abundant vapour, if not too local, implies checked radiation, and checked radiation
tends to abolish the difference of temperature between air and soll.

WeErrs had a theory of his own to account for the association of moderate refri-
