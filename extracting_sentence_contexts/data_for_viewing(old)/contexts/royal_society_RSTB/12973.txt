particularly important for human children. Children are
especially sensitive to information they obtain from others,
both in their everyday observation and imitation of actions
and in learning from testimony (for reviews, see [59,60]).

Moreover, children do all this learning in spite of the fact
that they lack many of the kinds of intelligence that are
characteristic of adults. Young children are noisy, variable,
unfocused, unpredictable and impulsive. They lack ‘executive
function’ abilities and capacities for focused and directed
attention and are notoriously bad at long-term planning
and deferred gratification [61,62]. In fact, almost by defi-
nition, young children cannot even take care of themselves
(this is what immaturity means).

In addition to being effective learners in general, human
children are especially good at exploratory ‘active learning’
that involves the pursuit of information about the world.
A new wave of empirical research shows that toddlers and
preschoolers explore the world and collect new information
in spontaneous, systematic and rational ways ([63-68]; see


[69] for a review). Even infants systematically explore surpris- [78], and the empirical literature, for the most part, seems | 5 |
