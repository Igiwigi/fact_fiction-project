where Q is the discrete symmetry operator associated with W (ie. either the time reversal or the
parity inversion operator), and Gx. is the generator of translations along W in the -w directions,
respectively. The right-hand side of equation (2.4) is called a ‘quantum virtual path’ (QVP) over
W; it expresses the ket |)(wo,0))w in terms of a mathematical construction that is regarded in
the theory as being fundamental.

QVPs extend Feynman’s sum-over-paths formalism [16] in two different ways. The first is
that, whereas each of Feynman’s paths are, in general, possible trajectories in space and time,
here each path represents a sequence of virtual displacements in either space or time. Virtual

2This makes use of the fact that a physical constraint limits the states that a system may occupy but it does not limit the
basis states that may be used to give expanded representations of any physically realizable state. In particular, the constraint
of bounded momentum restricts spatial distributions to having a minimum width, but allows a position eigenstate basis
expansion.


displacements arise in analytical mechanics when discussing constraints on motion [17]. A QVP
is the superposition of all possible paths of this kind (where the adjective ‘quantum’ is used in
the same sense as in the label ‘quantum walks’ [18]). The second is that, whereas Feynman used
sums over paths as a means for calculating the transition amplitude for a process with respect to
an initial and a final state, here a QVP is associated with the quantum state of a system itself.

The final observation that we need to construct the new theory is that there are expected to
