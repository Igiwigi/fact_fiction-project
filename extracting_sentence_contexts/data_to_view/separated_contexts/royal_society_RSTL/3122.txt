YouxG's suppositions, of the resistance
being as the angular flexure and the power of the radius, of which the index is
&, are equally erroneous, as is evinced by the foregoing experiments. In conelusion, it is evident that the subject of friction admits of an immense
variety of applications. To determine the measure of the resistances expe-
rienced by vessels and floating bodies in their motion through fluids ; the law
of the retardations of rivers, and the cause of the obstructions presented to the
waves of the ocean in the slopes assumed by its shores ; the equilibrium of
earths, and their connection with solids and fluids,â€”all of them are questions of
the utmost importance in the economy of nature, and their solution can only
be attained by an accumulation of facts. N.B. Since the foregoing paper was presented to the Royal Society, an abs-
tract of an extensive series of experiments on the expenditure of water through
rectangular orifices of large dimensions, has been submitted to the French
Academy by Messrs.
