Subglacial Lake Ellsworth lies at the bottom of a deep trough, 3 km beneath the ice surface at
the centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet about 70 km west of the Ellsworth Mountains. Seismic
studies reveal that this long narrow lake is approximately 150 m deep and covers an area of 29 km?

[14,16]. In 2012, an experiment was conducted to explore this lake using a purpose built clean
deep-ice hot water drill [14].

Lake Ellsworth, as all other Antarctic environments, is not only located in the most remote
continent on the Earth, but has been physically separated from other continents since the
detachment of Antarctica from the Gondwana supercontinent approximately 100 Ma ago. This
region is isolated from the rest of the world by the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic circumpolar
current and the circumpolar vortex. The configuration of the Southern Ocean, in fact, presents a
major barrier to potential colonizers of Antarctica by introduced species [17] and the absence of
industry and relatively low human impact have often earmarked the Antarctic as a region where
we can study the global effects of human activity. Nonetheless, diverse microbial communities
