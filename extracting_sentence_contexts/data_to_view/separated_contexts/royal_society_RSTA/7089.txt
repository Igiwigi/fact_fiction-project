bp (a) In all cases the fluids minimize the action jof grit, though the proportionate effect

-¢  ismarkedly less for Service azide than for the other two initiators investigated. This difference
‘g_-may be associated with the fact that lead azide is not easily wetted by the aqueous solutions
& tried.

2 (4) Mechanism of sensitiveness to grit friction. The fact that no large temperature coefficient
% has been observed for grit friction is most simply accounted for by assuming that the action
§ of friction in giving rise to detonation is mechanical, rather than thermal. It has been
= shown (cf. Bowden & Tabor 1942) that no large temperature coefficient is associated with
é mechanical friction.

= Further support for this assumption is derived from the experiments on Service azide
g around 300° C.
