The
network was trained to activate the correct set of output units corresponding to each item-context pair. For example, for robin can the network was trained to
activate grow, move, fly. (b) An explicit hierarchical tree representing the taxonomic hierarchy or the items used and the set of facts included in the training examples. Facts true of a node higher up the tree (e.g. animal) propagate down to the specific items at the bottom of the tree (e.g. can grow, can move, and can fly propagate
down to robin from the living thing, animal, and bird nodes respectively). Adapted with permission from fig. 2 [18, p. 1194] American Psychological Association.

that were true for that item and relation. For example, when Likewise, the neural network learned a schema—in this case,
given ‘robin CAN’ as input, the network’s task was to activate a taxonomic hierarchy—in which each learned item also had
the ‘grow’, ‘move’ and ‘fly’ output units.
