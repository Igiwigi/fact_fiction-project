Dutone and Perrr was 240° C., while in some of ours ¢ exceeded 300° C. We
are, however, inclined to attribute the inability of the formule of MM. Dutone and
Perir to give even the general shape of the curves which we have obtained to the
fact that the convection which occurs with thermometer bulbs hardly suggests the
very great convective cooling that experiments show to occur with very fine wires at
high temperatures.—May 31, 1892.] V. Calculation of the Distribution of Temperature along a Platinum Wire Heated
