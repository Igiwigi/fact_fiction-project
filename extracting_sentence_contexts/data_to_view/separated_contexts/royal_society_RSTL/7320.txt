For this reason
te proper course seems to be, first to determine to what extent the increased activity
& the heart which follows each inspiration may be accounted for as a mechanical effect
o&the expansion of the chest. Then, even if it be found that the whole of the obseryed
pEenomena may be thus explained, it will still be open to question how far the chemical
&n8equences of each respiration may be also concerned in their production. =The effect of the respiratory moyements on the arterial pressure stands in relation to
the fact, demonstrated by DoxbRs, that all the organs contained in the chest are kept
when its walls are at rest (as e. 9. after death) in a state of distension, s0 that the mass of
fEe thoracic viscera has constantly a tendency to shrink to a 8maller volume than that of
t&e cavity in which they are contained. As all of these organs possess elasticity, they must
ngcessarily all participate in any expansion of the whole mass, but inasmuch as they resist,
pansion mn very different degrees, their participation is unequal.
