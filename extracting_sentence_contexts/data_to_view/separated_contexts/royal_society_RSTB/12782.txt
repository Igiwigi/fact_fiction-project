Round embryos
have different constraints to contraction resulting in cells having a different cytoarchitecture. Images are embryos stained for eve expression, from [45]. The self-organization of this system arises from the fact a directional bias. Modelling actomyosin contraction has

organization of the machine that is trying to contract. Changing cient to orient force generation by the cytoskeleton along
the mechanical constraints from anisotropic resistance to the least compliant axis [45].
