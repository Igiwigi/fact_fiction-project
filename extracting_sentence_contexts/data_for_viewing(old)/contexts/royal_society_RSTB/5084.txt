be compared generally with other species from the same and the closely allied genera.
At the metaphase of the heterotype division there are, in Haworthia tesselata parva


NESTA FERGUSON: THE ALOIN A. 247

(Kew) eight large bivalent chromosomes and six smaller bivalent chromosomes (Plate 19,
fig. 18) compared with four large and three small bivalent chromosoines in the majority
of the observed species.

Reference to Tables V, VI and VII show that in length and width the chromosomes of
this tetraploid species are of the same order of magnitude as those of the majority of the
diploid species, while in Table LX the fact is abundantly clear that there is in the nuclei of
this species twice the volume of chromosome material found in the nuclei of any of
the diploid species. Hence, measurements show that in this instance the tetraploid
condition has, in all probability, been derived, not by a transverse division of the
chromosomes, but by a duplication of the entire chromatin complex of the nucleus.

Probably both methods have frequently occurred in the origin of tetraploid plants,
although hitherto few figures giving the comparative sizes of the chromosomes in diploid
and tetraploid forms have been available.

In (@nothera gigas the implication appears to be that the chromosome set of
(Z. Lamarckiana has been completely duplicated in the tetraploid mutant (10), (11).
