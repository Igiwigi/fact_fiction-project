The same integral is finite when taken along any parallel to the imaginary axis in
the finite part of the plane, which does not pass through finite singularities of the
subject of integration.

* With this theorem the reader may compare the method used by the author to obtain the asymptotic
expansion of the multiple gamma function, ‘Cambridge Philosophical ‘Transactions,’ vol, 19, §§ 55-57,

The second part of the theorem is true, since when s = ~+w and |v| is very large,
|r (—s)| behaves like exp{-3 |v] } ;

The first part follows from this fact in combination with the asymptotic expansion
of I (—s) for complex values of s.
§ 10. If L, be a contour parallel to the imaginary axis and cutting the real axis

between s = 0 and s = —1, the contour, if necessary, having a loop to ensure that
—@ is to its left as in the figure, then

For by the lemma we may bend the contour round until it becomes the contour
3 L, of the figure.
