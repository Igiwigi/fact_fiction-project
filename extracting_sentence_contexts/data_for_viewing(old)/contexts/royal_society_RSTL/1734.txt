Some curious facts respecting the walrus and seal, &c. 239

The resemblance of the bones of the hind flipper of a
walrus to those of the human hand, which I believe is like
nothing else in nature, is curiously exact; the bones of the
wrist are the same in number and shape ; s0 are those of
the metacarpus ; s0 also the phalanges of the thumb and
fingers. The tendons of the perforantes muscles pass through
those of the perforati in the palm upon the metacarpal
bones, while in the human hand this takes place upon the
first phalanges of the fingers ; and there are no lumbricales
muscles whatever. On the back of this gigantic hand I was
astonished to find the tendon of the indicator muscle.
