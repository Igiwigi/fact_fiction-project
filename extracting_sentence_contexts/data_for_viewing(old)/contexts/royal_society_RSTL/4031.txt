blastodermal cells, that is, of the progeny of the primary blastodermal cells, or nutri-
tive centres, is employed by the nutrient matter of the remaining secondary or
proper blastodermal cells. In this way * pabulum‚Äù is afforded for two purposes, the
growth of the blastoderma, and the growth of the embryo itself.

During the early period of the existence of the blastoderma, before the circulation
has been established, the product of solution of the elder is at once absorbed by the
younger cells. During the later periods, the product of solution drops into the inci-
pient loops of the blood-yessels, and s0 circulates for purposes of nutrition. This is
an instance of primary lymphatic absorption, and differs in no- essential particular
from the same process in the animal further advanced. We may consider the blas-
toderma in fact, during the first period of its circulation, as containing very numerous
lymphatic ducts, instead of a few, as in the-more perfect animal.

In the blastoderma, the process by which nutrient matter passes into the circnla-
tion, or the act of absorption, as it is usually called, is reduced to its most simple
form, being contemporaneous and also identical with the formation of the imperfect
capillary network. In the more advanced animal, when the capillary network is
consolidated, the product of 8olution of the textures passes or drops into the inter-
cellular or textural lacunz, which appear to be the radicles of the lymphatic system;
a system which in the adult, communicates with the blood-vessels only at a few places
in- the neighbourhood of the trunks of the original blastodermal veins.

The blastoderma may be considered therefore not only as the first form which the
