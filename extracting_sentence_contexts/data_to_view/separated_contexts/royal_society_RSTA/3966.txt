But in this case E, = 382-062
E, = 806°425, and this gives the correlation ‘2994. On the other hand, the actual
ratio of variabilities is 1°12, while (lxix.) makes it 2°76! This arises from the fact
that the errors in E, and E,, due to the mean being off the 45° line, tend to cancel in
EK, + E,, but tend in directly opposite directions in the ratio of the cosines. Similarly
the correlation between father and son works out ‘5666, which may be compared with
the values given in Illustration V. below, ranging from ‘5198 to °5939. Again,
correlation in eye-colour between husband and wife came out by the excess process
‘0986, and by the process given earlier in the present Memoir ‘1002.
