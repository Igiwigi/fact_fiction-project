Panel (d) exhibits the linear relationship of the transitivity (equation (2.4)) with inverse
temperature, basic to our derivation of the d-Arrhenius formula. Sub-Arrhenius behaviour, discussed as a manifestation of
quantum mechanical tunnelling through a potential energy barrier as exemplified in the panel. (Online version in colour.)


(i) Transition state theory

The Eyring formulation [4,6] of chemical reaction rates provided chemists with the basic
ingredients for understanding and even predicting both parameters A and E of the Arrhenius
equation (equation (2.9)) [1] and is assumed as a paradigm for describing the temperature
dependence of the rate coefficient of chemical reactions:

kT Q*

KT _Q? es
h QiQ>

(for simplicity, we consider a bimolecular process), where h is the Planck constant, Q; and Qo

are the (translational, vibrational and rotational) partition functions of the two reactants, and Q#
is the partition function of the activated complex, from which the translational contribution along

krsr(B) = (4.5)

the reaction coordinate is excluded. A recent paper [20] exploits the fact that the parameters of : =
equation (4.5) can be explicitly obtained from features of barriers on PESs, as generated from 3
current codes for quantum chemistry calculations. The factor (kT /h) Q%/QiQo has sometimes : a
been called the collision number, but a more satisfactory term used is frequency factor. The : =
quantity E is the energy of activation of the reaction, encountered before as representing the : a
energy that the molecule in the initial state of the process must acquire before it can take part [4
in the reaction. al

Early concerns on possible deviations from Arrhenius behaviour because of quantum :3
mechanical tunnelling (swb-Arrhenius behaviour) were circumvented ad hoc, e.g. by a : 3

multiplicative transmission coefficient x evaluated according to recipes, such as those due to
Eckart [106], Pelzer & Wigner [3] and Bell [107].
