for the present to form a much simpler theory of the physiological action of the elec-
tric current than that we have at present, if it be true that we have any at all.

All are aware that a spark is emitted on the instant the circuit of a pile is closed,
and again on breaking the circuit. It is also well known that the spark emitted on
breaking the circuit increases if the circuit is composed of an electro-magnetic-spiral
with its cylinder of iron. Let it be remembered that there is no sign of the current |
passing when the circuit continues closed ; to produce contraction the circuit must |
be broken or closed anew. The simplest idea then which we can admit, and which
is demonstrated by experiment, is that muscular contraction is excited in every |
case by the electric park. That which might perbaps have appeared to be in oppo-
sition to the admission of this idea, is the fact of the frog contracting from very
feeble currents. It is very easy to overthrow this difficulty. In fact, I may dis-
pense with any further repetition of experiments by recalling Voura's opinion in
support. Immediately after Garvanr's first discovery, VoLra applied himself to the
study of the action of the discharge of the jar upon the nerves of frogs and other
animals; and in his very first memoir upon Animal Electricity, he declares that the
prepared frog is without comparison the most sensitive electrometer we POSSESS. In
one of his experiments he found that a charge at all times sufficient to excite con-
tractions could not be estimated at the 5th of a degree of his straw electrometer.

Indeed it is very easy to verify these assertions of Voura. My plan is as follows :â€”I
take a small Leyden jar having about thirty square centimetres of coating, and after
baving charged it to saturation, I discharge it four times successively with a metallic
rod, 80 as at last to produce no perceptible spark. In the same manner, at this
