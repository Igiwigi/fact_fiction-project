appear rounded, smooth, and, under a magnifying-glass, exactly like the surrounding
mrface; but the appearance of antiquity which would thence attach to the indentation,
were it really an incision, may, as it seems to. me, be readily explained on the prezump-
tion of its being merely an accidental impression.
- Several other instances might be cited, but one or two more will suffice, to show that.
kmilar: assemblages of bones were formed probably at the remotest periods of the history
the cavern. In one case between thirty and forty bones and teeth of a young Bear,
ether with a gnawed fragment of the scapula, seyeral portions of the ribs, an
+-——_l s0me metacarpal bones, a bone of the sternum, and teeth belonging to a
"Sture animal, were found at a depth of 5 feet in the third bed, and at a distance of
7; feet from the entrance of the Flint-knife Gallery, intermixed with a tooth of Felis
Won and bones and teeth of Hyzna, Rhinoceros, and Reindeer. The ursine bones and
ogth are all dark-coloured and dense, and, in fact, in precisely the same condition as those
xSthe other animals.
A second instance of the kind was afforded about 8 feet further from the entrance
the Gallery and at the same depth of 5 feet, where between thirty and forty bones,
& fragments of bones, of a still younger Bear were found lying altogether, but, as,
iSroula seem, without mixture with those of any other animal. These bones present,
tly the same ancient character, and they would seem to have been those of a sucking

Fry respect with those of a skeleton of a young Norwegian Bear in the collection
he British Museum, in which the middle permanent incisors of the upper jaw are in
pace though quite unworn, and the second and third milk-incisors still retained, together
"2h the much-worn milk-canines. In the same jaw the first and third milk-molars,
Bl behind these the first permanent molar, or 4 pm, is nearly protruded ; and behind
