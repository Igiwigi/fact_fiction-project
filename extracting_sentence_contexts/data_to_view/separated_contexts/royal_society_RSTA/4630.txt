of tin) is shown. The eutectic can be definitely traced in this micrograph, and the structure of this
alloy is not affected in this respect by prolonged heating at 175°C. This fact,
» together with the cooling-curves already described, leads to the conclusion that the
eutectic extends very nearly to the tin end of the series, and that the solubility of
lead in tin is zero or very nearly zero, For the purpose of determining the limiting solubility of tin in lead, the alloys in
the neighbourhood of a tin content of 15 per cent. were carefully examined after six
weeks’ exposure to heat at a temperature of 175°C.
