(10-15 ms), associated with 40 Hz oscillations of
neurons and their network dynamics, is considered to
be responsible for recognizing external events and
generating the concept of simultaneity (Joliot et al. 1994).
Essentially, this dynamic geometry helps us under-
stand the nature of sensory-motor transformation. The
stochastic metric tensor in dynamic geometry can be
written as function of four space-time coordinates
(i.e. three space and one time of Minkowski space) and
a fifth dimension (Roy 1998). This fifth dimension is a
probability space as well as a metric space. This extra SV 1X, OFX | DFO),
dimension is an embedded degree of freedom and is where Y is the (set of) observed data; 0 is a set of model
random in nature. In fact, the dynamic geometry parameters; and X is an unobserved (latent) stationary
framework makes it possible to distinguish one individual stochastic process. This stochastic process is induced by
from another. The uniqueness of individuals must the first-order transition model
operate in detail not in principle, i.e. general solutions = f(X( + 1) | X(0), 0),
must operate on the basis of a generalized solution field.
Considering the stochastic nature of specific brain
function among individuals, they will have both ana-
tomical and functional variances, similar to the f(X(t + 1) | Xd, A)
differences in their facial characteristics. The variances
must be such that they modulate, rather than destroy, the is known, but the distribution of the stochastic process in
general solution. However, the variances may be so equilibrium, i.e. f (X|@), is generally unknown. Here, it is
extreme that they negate the function or may even be important to note that the data Yhas been assumed to be
lethal. Within this framework, social variance enriches the observed when the underlying process is in equilibrium.
