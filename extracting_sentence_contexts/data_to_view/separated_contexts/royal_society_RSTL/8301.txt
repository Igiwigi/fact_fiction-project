: In the Reindeer Gallery the stalagmitic floor dipped southwards, at an angle of 25%,
from its northern end to a few feet beyond the Steep Slide Hole; thence to the eastern
end of the Flint-knife Gallery its dip was reversed in direction and greatly diminished |
in amount; and from the latter point to the Crystal Gorge it again dipped sonthward,
but still at a small angle. The exceptionally large inclination at the northern end was
dne to the fact that there the stalagmite covered the talus formed by the first bed,
beneath which the second and third beds lay. Deposits in the less important parts of the Cavern.—The description just given of
the * Third” and © Fourth” Beds applies only to the West Chamber, the Flint-knife
Gallery, and the northern branch of the Reindeer Gallery. South of the Crystal Gorge the deposit was a mixture of loam, fine sand, and finely
comminuted shale in variable proportions, occasionally cemented and stained with
ferruginous matter.
