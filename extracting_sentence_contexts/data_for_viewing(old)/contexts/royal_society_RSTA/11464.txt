AT KEW OBSERVATORY AND THEIR DISCUSSION, 479

The ratios would seem to be somewhat above their average near the centre of the
range, and below it at both extremities; but there are hardly sufficient experiments
to justify any too positive conclusion. That the mean ratio is less than unity is
absolutely clear; and there can be but little doubt that this is due to the fact that
the stoppage at the lowest point in the case of the slower experiments was not
doubled along with the other time intervals.

I likewise compared experiments Nos. 27 and 28 over the longest range, 30-15
inches, at the slower rate, 1 inch in 10 minutes, with earlier experiments, Nos. 10,
11, 14, 15, over the same range at the normal rate. Only one aneroid, No. 4, was

x available for calculation, owing to erratic behaviour in No. 1. It will thus suffice to
& mention that the results obtained were analogous to those in Table XX XIV., and
& that for the ratio of the sums of the differences of the descending and ieee
' readings at the two different rates I found
