On the other hand, the increase of average energy for evolution with small initial energy is
characteristic for dissipative systems. The dynamics of the particle resembles the dynamics of
conservative systems [22], though the particle energy is not conserved after collisions. This could
be explained by the fact that this energy can both increase and decrease due to collisions, and the
energy is conserved at the average over the period of wall position modulation. For non-elastic
collisions, we have asymptotic stability of periodic regimes, but chaotic dynamics takes place
again for large deviations of the initial values from the steady-state values.

3. Asingle quantum particle in a dynamical trap

For quantum particles in a trap, essential are their wave nature and their energy spectrum
discreteness.
