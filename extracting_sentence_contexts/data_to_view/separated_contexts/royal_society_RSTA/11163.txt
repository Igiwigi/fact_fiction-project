Results are deduced relating to the possibility of
uniformising any algebraic functions by automorphic functions of such groups, and
the analytical connexion of the uniformising variable with the variables of the form. In § 2, certain properties of substitutions of period two are found, which are of use
later. These substitutions are for brevity termed “ self-inverse ” substitutions, owing
to the fact that they ave the same as their inverse substitutions. In § 3,a method is given for carrying out the division of the plane into polygons,
corresponding to a group generated by a given set of self-inverse substitutions. It is
proved that the genus of the group is zero, although the group has sub-groups whose
genus is greater than zero.
