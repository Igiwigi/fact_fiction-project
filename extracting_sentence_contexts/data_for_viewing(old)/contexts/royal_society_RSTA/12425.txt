where P = m/4ap,r and p = 2 o/477, the potentials of matter m/p, and o, where 7
is the distance from m or from o to the point where P and p are reckoned.
The value of the second part in (205), depending upon o, comes to

and its rate of decrease with respect to a expresses the repulsion between the pole
and the p, region. This gives (203) again.

A fourth way is by means of the quasi-electromagnetic force on fictitious interfacial
electric current, instead of matter, the current being circular about the axis of
symmetry AB, The formula for the attraction is
