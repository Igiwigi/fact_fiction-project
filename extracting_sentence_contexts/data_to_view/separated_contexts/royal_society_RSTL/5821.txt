WILLIAMS'S RESEARCHES ON THE STRUCTURE AND HOMOLOGY

The first impression is, that they must be connected with the reproductive masses ; but _
in what way and what physiological sense? Tt has already been demonstrated that the
ovaria and testes respectively, in their several segments, are anatomically developed from
the ciliated tubes. But this fact throws no light upon the use of the tubes themselyes. Ts
it possible that they can act as the conduits by which the generative products are con-
veyed into the perigastric cavity? No, it is not possible, for the cilia by which the tubes
are lined act in the reverse direction, tending rather to carry outwards, and that with
great force,. any body that may perchance be thrown into the channels of the tubes.
