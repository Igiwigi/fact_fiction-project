which the velocity is greatest, with a range in all of from 20 to 45 fathoms. We

and the average flux of energy across a parallel of latitude is found to be
1°06 x 10" ergs/sec.

The northward flux on the Chinese side is more difficult to determine, as the
direction of the currents is variable. Two phenomena are intermingled here. The
issuing tide from the Yellow Sea comes down this coast, but there is also a definite
tidal wave that travels into and out of the large bend in the coast whose extremities
are Shan-tung promontory and Shanghai. This is shown by the fact that along the
northern part of this bend, on which Tsing-tao stands, the current flows northwards
while the tide is ebbing both along this coast and in the northern part of the
Yellow Sea. Thus in this bay the main tide is the local tide of the bay itself and
not the general tide of the Yellow Sea. The currents produced by these tides are
rotary, probably an effect of the earth’s rotation ; and it seems that the northward
component of the velocity is small. Further, it is probably nearly in a phase at
right angles to the tide, as great divergences from this relation can be produced only
by great dissipations and accordingly by great velocities in the vicinity. Hence for
both reasons we infer that the northward flux of energy along the Chinese coast is
small in comparison with that on the Korean side.

We also need to know the work done on the water by the moon. If 7 is the
