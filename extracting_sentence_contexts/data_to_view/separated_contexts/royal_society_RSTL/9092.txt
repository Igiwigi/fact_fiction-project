the mean sphere—or more strictly the mean spheroid of revolution which represents
the average shape of the earth. The spheroid was endued with the power of gravi-
tation, and it was shown that the action of the spheroid on its own tides might be
found approximately by considering the state of flow in the mean sphere caused by
tho attraction of the protuberances, and also by supposing the action of the protu-
berances on the sphere to be normal thereto, and to consist, in fact, merely of the
weight (either positive or negative) of the protuberances. Thus if @ be the mean radius of the sphere, w its density, 9 mean gravity at the

interior of the sphere (now free of gravitation) to be under the action of a potential

This expression therefore gave the effective potential when the sphere was treated
as devoid of gravitational power.
