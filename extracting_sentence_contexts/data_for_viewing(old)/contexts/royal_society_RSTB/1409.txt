across a branch at some little distance from its actual base, we often find
culiar structure, already described and figured in former memoirs.* The
section of the branch shows no well-defined pith and no clear traces of
y groups of xylem. It consists of a parenchymatous mass, into which

tracheides describe strange curves, and extend as far as the middle of the

the normal Calamitean stem, becomes more and more anomalous. Such a
