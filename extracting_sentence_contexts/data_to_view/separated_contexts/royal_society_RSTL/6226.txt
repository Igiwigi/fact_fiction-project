The more I am acquainted with eledricity, the
more 1 admire a wonderful fimplicity which ſeems
to prevail in nature, at leaſt in this part which abounds
with phznomena of a very curious kind; whereof. .
many that haye paſſed under my examination of late
are ſo extremely nice, that I ayoid venturing to relate
them, becauſe 1 would not willingly ſubje&t myſelf.

F cannot enter into this particular ſubje&, without
firſt ſettling a diſpute amongſt eleQricians, which ſub-
iſts at this day, concerning the two eleQtricities; be-
cauſe ſome conſequences, drawn from the ſeveral ex-
periments I have to produce, greatly depend upon it. Poliſhed glaſs, upon being rubbed properly, has
been ſuppoſed to give an elefricity to bodies, and
thoſe bodies that receive it from the glaſs, are ſaid to
be electrified plus. Whereas wax, amber, &c, upon
being rubbed in the ſame manner, have on the con-

trary been ſuppoſed to receive an eleCtricity from:

bodies, and thoſe bodies which part with it are ſaid
to be electrified minus, But no experiment, that I
know of, has yet appeared to determine which of
theſe eleQricities does really eledrify plus, and which
of them does really ele&rify minus; though it hap-
pens that the faCt turns out juſt as they have all along
ſuppoſed. In a ſecond treatiſe upon the ſubject of eleQricity,
that I publiſhed in the year 1748, ſeveral experi-
ments were produced, to ſhew that all bodies are ſur-
rounded with a medium, which is of an exceeding
elaſtic nature, and extends but to a very ſmall di/-
tance from the body when it is not diſturbed by heat,
or other cauſes. Since that, other experiments of the
like kind have been publiſhed in a- work, wherein
