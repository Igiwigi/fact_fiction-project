RADIATION OF HEAT BY GASEOUS MATTER. 69

absorption of ammonia is over 8even thousand times, the absorption of olefiant gas 8even
thousand nine hundred and fifty times, while the action of slphurous acid is eight
thousand eight hundred times that of air.

It is impossible not to be struck by the position of chlorine and bromine in this
Table. They are elements, and notwithstanding their colour and density, they take rank
after the transparent elementary gases. The perfectly transparent olefiant gas absorbs
more than one hundred and thirty times the amount absorbed by the untransparent
chlorine, and nearly fifty times the quantity absorbed by the intensely brown vapour of
bromine. TI cannot think this fact insignificant. Hitherto chemists have spoken to us
of elements, and we have helped ourselves to conceptions regarding them and their
compounds in the only way possible to our mental constitution. But our conceptions
remained purely subjective, nor were we acquainted with any physical trait which would
in any degree justify these conceptions. Here, however, we seem to touch the ultimate
particles of matter. Starting from the idea that a gas absorbs such vibrations as are i80-
chronic with its own, in all cases the compound gas reveals itself to the mind's eye with
its molecules on the whole swinging more slowly than the uncombined atoms of which
it is composed. Their absorption of the longer undulations proves their general coinci-
dence in period with those undulations. We load the atom by the act of chemical union,
and thereby render its vibrations more sluggish, that is to say, more fit to synchronise
with the slowly recurrent waves of obscure heat.
