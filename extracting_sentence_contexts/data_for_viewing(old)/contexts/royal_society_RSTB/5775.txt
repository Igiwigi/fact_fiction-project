“This is very certain, there are at least three species in the Gray Bull beds
of the Bighorn Wasatch.” It follows, therefore, that such species as H. leporinum
and H. vulpiceps (if indeed they are separable as species) and such forms as
Propachynolophus maldani, etc., might easily be co-zeval, and to base stratigraphic
conclusions on their occurrence is unsafe.

3. Is there always an increase in size from lower to higher levels ¢

The answer is in the negative. Hohippus resartus, for instance, the largest
species of Eocene horse in America, comes from the Grey Bull beds and also
from the New Mexican Wasatch. In the succeeding Wind River, Bridger and
Uinta there is nothing larger than this form and, in fact, most species from these
later horizons are smaller. It is not until the Oligocene (Mesohippus) that there
is a decided increase in size. This sounds a note of warning against using an
increase in size as a sure sign of a later level (e.g., Propachynolophus gaudryi),
although in general the increase in size from Hyracotherium to Equus is obviously
true. -

Summary.

1. The British specimens of Eocene horses so far discovered belong to a single genus
Hyracotherium and can be divided into three species, H. cuniculus, H. leporimum and
H., vulpiceps. The last two being very close together.
