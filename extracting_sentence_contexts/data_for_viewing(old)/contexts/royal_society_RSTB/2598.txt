broad, the granulations rounded, whereas in Galaxea the strive are knife-edged and
the granulations sharply pointed.

A transverse section of the septum Luphyllia has been published by Bourne.* Tt
is described by him as composed of parallel fibres arranged on the opposite sides of
one continuous median axis (“centre”) of calcification. Actually, however, this
“centre of calcification ” is made up of a number of centres, very closely placed, and
elliptical in outline. The fibres emerging from those small elliptical axes are
practically parallel, each group corresponding to the broad-shaped stria on the surface.
The fibres are not obliquely placed with reference to the axes of the striz, but. are
almost horizontally oriented. In other words, the deposit is laid down from the first
by the lateral flaps of the septal invagination, and not at the upper edge where the
flaps meet. The absolutely smooth edge of the septum finds in this fact a simple
explanation,

The septa of Huphyllia, therefore, although finely striated on their surfaces, show
two important features of distinction from the septa of types hitherto discussed :—

(1.) Smooth upper edge.

(2.) The fibres are directed almost horizontally outwards from the median plane of
calcification to the opposite surfaces.

These correlated features suggest that the septal invagination is not frilled along
