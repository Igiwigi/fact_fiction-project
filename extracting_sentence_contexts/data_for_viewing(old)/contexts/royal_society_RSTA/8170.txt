A small quantity of wax spheres placed in a circular tube gave a beautiful series of
ridges, as shown in fig. 39, Plate 25. The shadows to be seen to the right of each ridge
show how clearly separated the particles in the ridge are. The particles in this case
are ones graded by sieving only, and were about 0-6 mm. in diameter. It is to be
noted that there is no tendency to form intermediate ridges; thisis to be expected, since
this phenomenon has been shown to depend upon the presence of particles of widely
different sizes. Electrification of the particles being suspected, the tube was silvered
and polished inside, and the silver coating earthed. It is doubtful whether real
clectrification effects were present in the unsilvered tube, the irregularities being
afterwards traced to other causes.

Since the spacing in the cylindrical tube is clearly influenced by the fact that there
are very few particles in the extreme ridges, experiments were then carried out with
wax spheres in a square tube. Very uniform particles graded with the slit, of diameter
about 0-29 mm., were used in these experiments. Ridges are formed across the
tube, but with the wax spheres they are not quite so straight as they are with the cork
particles. The wax spheres move with great ease on the smooth surface of the glass,
so that the slightest disturbance will impair the straightness of a ridge. The great
straightness of the cork ridges may be due to the friction, which undoubtedly exists
in the case of cork particles, having a stabilising influence, or it may be that the
irregularly shaped particles in the ridge become partly entangled, and so form a flexible
strip which tends to behave as a whole. Be that as it may, the extreme mobility of
the wax spheres has as a result that the ridges react to the slightest irregularity in
the motion, and present the appearance shown in fig. 40, Plate 25. (It is to be
