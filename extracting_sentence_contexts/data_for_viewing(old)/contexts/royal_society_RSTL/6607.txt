a formula which is generally deduced as the result of s0mewhat long analytical work.

72. Secondly, in order to give a striking example of the manner in which the theory
of the determinants of lines explains and shortens analytical processes, T will give the
following direct proof of EuLgR's equations.

Take the principal axes at the fixed point as the axes of coordinates. Let v,, v,, v, be
the components of the yelocity V, and f., f,, f. those of the acceleration P of a particle
(z, y, 2) of mass m.

We have seen that the fact of the acceleration being the complete differential coeffi-
cient of the yelocity leads at once to the three following equations :—
