occasions with regard to different parts of the spectrum. A bright line was observed in
the solar spectrum itself, a little less refrangible than the line C.

On the Spectrum, of the Prominences.

The existence of three lines in the spectrum of the prominences and their approximate
poitions were determined and communicated to the Royal Society on the 20th of
October. See Plate XXXVII. figs. 1, 2, 3.

"The coincidence of one of the lines with the solar line C was at once determined.

The coincidence of another line with F at a certain distance from the sun's surface was
finally determined on the 5th of November, when the fact of the widening out of the
lines towards the sun was discovered.

The exact position of the line near D is shown in Plate XXXVII. fig. 2, in which it

is laid down from the mean of three careful micrometrical measurements made under far
from good atmospheric conditions on the 15th of November. In Kincnnoyy's map the
new line falls in a region where no line was measured by him. TI may also add that, by
the kindness of Mr. Gasstor, I have been enabled to inspect the very elaborate maps
of the spectrum constructed at Kew Observatory. 'The measures aboye given make the
