theory that non-vibrational movements of the Â«ther are involved. The ether not
being matter, it need not obey the laws of the dynamics of matter, provided it obey
another scheme of dynamical laws consistent among themselves ; these laws must
however be such that we can construct in the ether an atomic system of matter
which itself obeys the actual material laws, The sole spacial relations of the cether
itself, on which its dynamies depend, those namely of incompressibility and rotational
elasticity, are thus to be classed along with the existing Euciipean relations of
measurements in space (which also might a priori be different from what they are)
as part of the ultimate scheme of mental representation of the actual physical world.
The elastic and other characteristics of ordinary matter, including its viscous rela-
tions, are on the other hand a direct consequence of its molecular constitution, in
combination with the law of material energy which is itself a consequence of the
fact that the energies of the atoms are wholly located in the surrounding simple
continuous ether and are thus functions of their mutual configurations. In this way
we come round again to an order of procedure similar to that by which Cavcny
and Poisson originally based the elastic relations of material bodies on the mutual
actions of their constituent molecules.

Consider any two portions of matter which have a potential-energy function
depending, as above explained, on their mutual configuration alone, the material
movements being thus comparatively slow compared with the velocity of radiation ;
any displacement of them as a single rigid system, whether translational or rota-
tional, can involve no expenditure of work ; hence the resultant forcive exerted by
the first system on the second must statically equilibrate that exerted by the second
system on the first, these forcives must in fact be equal and opposite wrenches on a
