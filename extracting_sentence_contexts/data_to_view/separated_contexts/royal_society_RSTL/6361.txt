Something, however, will perhaps be accomplished in that direc-
tion in our future observations, by employing silver for the second reflexion ; but if ever
telescopes of equal power are erected in climates more fayourable than this, perhaps
more will be effected than would be possible here by pushing increase of aperture to
the largest practicable limits. In making a election from observations 80 numerous, there has been considerable
difficulty. It was not always easy to decide how much it would be practicable tg omit
without the danger of conveying an erroneous impressionâ€”without, on the one hand,
Perhaps unduly weakening the evidence of the fact recorded, or, on the other, unduly
strengthening it. For instance: if, in the observations of a particular object, we find it
recorded on six different nights that a minute star was seen inyolyed, and that on six

years, two cases might arise requiring very different treatment.
