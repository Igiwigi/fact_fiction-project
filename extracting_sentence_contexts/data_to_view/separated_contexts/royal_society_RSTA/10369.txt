Besides the monthly data, the tables give the values of the c’s for the three
seasonal inequalities, expressed in percentages of their mean, and likewise the absolute
values of the c’s in the mean inequalities for the year.—(See pp. 408-411.)

There are of course irregularities in the monthly values, but there is an unmistakable
general tendency for the percentage values to rise in winter and fall in summer as we
pass from sun-spot minimum years through average years to sun-spot maximum years
at Kew. Tn the case of D the Greenwich data stand on the far side, so to speak, of the Kew
sun-spot maximum data, The same is true for c, in H, but in the case of the other
three coefficients in H the Greenwich data approach most closely to the average year
results for Kew. It would be of interest to know how much of the differences between
Kew and Greenwich is due to difference in geographical position, and how much is due


ON “QUIET” DAYS DURING THE ELEVEN YEARS 1890 TO 1900, ETC 407

to the fact that the Kew data are from quiet days only, while the Greenwich data are
from all days. Tables XXXVIT. and XXXVIIL. are derived from the same data as Tables XXXV.
and XXXVI., but they are intended to show the influence of sun-spot frequency on
the relative importance of the different Fourier terms. Table XXXVIT. deals only with the mean diurnal inequality for the whole year
but gives data for W and N as well as for D and H.
