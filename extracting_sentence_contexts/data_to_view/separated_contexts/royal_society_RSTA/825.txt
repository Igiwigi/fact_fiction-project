If in fact m — 25, we shall need well over 2000 observations to detect it; but in 650

observations there will ordinarily be some beyond the range where the series gives

a satisfactory approximation. It will be only at such large values of m that the number
of observations needed to show that m is not infinite will be 10,000 or more that the
approximation by series will be of any use. The trouble is that it is biased in dealing
with the outlying observations, which are precisely the ones of most use in finding m.

We can illustrate this from the above series.
