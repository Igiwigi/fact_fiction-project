The greatest interest comes from the fields of clinical chemistry [1,2], toxicology [3] and : z
forensics [4]. This interest can be—in part—attributed to the success of mass spectrometry (MS). In : ey
fact, MS is a versatile technique of chemical analysis—often used in molecular characterization of :S
biological matrices [5]. Development of very sensitive analytical methods, based on MS, enables —
detection of various substances at very low concentrations [6]. Thus, it is often possible to detect :=
trace quantities of a drug after the administration of a single dose.
