C Lamm 1. From shared activations to shared representations

e-mail: claus.lamm@univie.ac.at The seminal discovery of Singer et al. [1] that empathy for pain results in brain
activations overlapping with those engaged when being in pain oneself has
triggered a persistent debate regarding what these overlapping or shared acti-
vations imply in terms of the underlying neural functions and psychological
mechanisms. Initially, the majority of scholars have welcomed the fact that simi-
lar parts of the brain are active during first-hand and empathic experiences as
support for claims grounded in simulation theory and embodied social cogni-
tion that we ‘reactivate’ or use our own emotion systems in order to sense
and feel what another person is sensing and feeling. A major drawback of neuroimaging methods is, however, that the relationship
between neural activations and mental representations—and_ the cognitive and
affective processes supposedly engaged in an experimental condition—is not
always straightforward ([2], for in-depth discussion). In the light of the method’s
limitations, it is mainly the existence of shared activations (‘the language of the
brain’) but not necessarily of shared representations (‘the language of the mind /cog-
nition’), that could be derived by previous social neuroscience research on empathy.
