Therefore, in the presence of heat conduction, the energy-momentum tensor T/? = Z”,,/,/=8 is : gS

where the term J,,4j, can be called the thermal stress.

(iv) Entropy

In this section, we introduce an entropy of our theory and rewrite the conservation law (2.25)1,
which is, in fact, the entropy conservation law, in a conventional form. For brevity, we shall not
consider the dependence of the energy potential on &“, in this section.

First, we introduce the spatial projection w,, of the thermal impulse J,

y= Mf, = Jy — Tey. (2.27)

Let us also define total energy potentials (at the moment we use symbol E, while symbol &
will appear later on, after a Legendre transform in (2.30))

EUu) =E(T, J) =E(T, w), (2.28)
where E = £L/,/=g, T= —u"Ju, J = Jus“, w= wy,w" =] + T?, and, in particular,
