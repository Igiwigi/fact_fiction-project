To this end, they had
to persuade people that certain facts about electricity generation and its costs were not what
technical experts claimed they were, and that their own ideological claims, by contrast, rested on
factual foundations. Uncertainty created opportunities for such persuasion to occur. To use the term ‘factual foundations’ is not to invoke a positivist conception of those
foundations nor a realist conception of scientific theories, much less to endorse an absolutist
vision of scientific truth. (David Bloor, in his recent book, The Enigma of the Aerofoil, is eloquent on
these distinctions [36].) It is rather to point out that it is in the character of propaganda to create
arguments that one knows are untrue, or at least misleading. But what defines a technical claim as
misleading? The answer necessarily involves a comparison with the conclusions of independent
experts.
