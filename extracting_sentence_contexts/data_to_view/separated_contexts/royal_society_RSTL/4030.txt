the decomposition of the iodide of silver
by the action of light. It is true that light decomposes iodide of silver, forming a
subiodide, but this seems to require a longer time than that during which the sur-
face is endowed with the property of attracting the vapours of mercury. In fact, the
last property is communicated nearly instantaneously, which is not the case for the
decomposition of the iodide by the action of light.
