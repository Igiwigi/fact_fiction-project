fig. 51, the almost exact correspondence, allowing for the necessary errors of measure-
ment, of the depth of the conjoined 4th and 5th layers is well shown, as is also the
extreme atrophy of the line of GeNNaRi in the blind cases, and the considerable
decrease of thickness of layer 3a. In Case 6, owing to the almost complete
invisibility of the latter layer, layers 3a and 3b were measured together. On
examination of layers 1 and 2 another important fact appears, viz, that there
is an almost exact correspondence between the thickness of the conjoined Ist and
2nd layers of the cortex, and the degree of amentia or dementia existing in the
patient. Case 1 is normal, Case 4 which showed a relatively slight degree of
dementia approaches most nearly to the normal. Cases 5 and 6 of infants aged
respectively three months and one month come next in order, and Cases 3 and 4
of pronounced chronic insanity with dementia, occupy the last place on the list.
This is a point of considerable importance in view of the facts that the 4th and 5th
layers show no constant variation, and that layer 3 as a whole is of the same thick-
ness respectively in the three patients with normal vision, and in the three cases of
blindness. In Table IV. (fig. 52), a similar relation is seen in the respective depth of
the conjoined 1st and 2nd layers of the cortex in the different cases. Here, however,
in the infants, and especially in the younger of the two, this layer is much thinner
than in the cases of pronounced chronic insanity, on the other hand, in the first four
cases on the list, the same relation exists as that shown in Table III. (fig. 51). This is
probably to be explained by the non-development of the purely psychic regions of the
cortex in infants as, owing to the fact that the afferent tracts develop before the
efferent, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the psychic portion of the visuo-:
