both observations were made in the shade, or both in the
sun, and likewise less than that deduced from the deviation
due to torsion ; and this, from the observations, appears to
have been decidedly the case. Probably, however, the acce-
lerations in the times of vibration are only consequences of
the diminution of the arcs, both in the case of the copper
disc and of the needle vibrating in the sun : till this accele-
ration will account for these differences in the decrements of
intensity.

Although we should not at present be able to point out
the manner in which the rays of the sun tend to bring the
needle to rest, the discovery of a fact proving magnetic influ-
ence in the solar rays must, I think, ultimately lead to impor-
tant conclusions respecting the phenomena of terrestrial
magnetism. On this account it is desirable that the mode of
observing should be varied, and that observations should be
made in climates more favourable for the purpose than our
own. [I regret that, in consequence of my absence from
home, I could not repeat the experiments during the ex-
tremely hot and clear weather of the past summer, as it is
probable that the effects might have been even more decided
than those which I have detailed. Possibly the effect might
