Fig. 9
illustrates a crystal showing faces of ¢ {001} and g {011} very like those of a
potassium salt of the series. In all four salts of the iron group there is a marked
tendency for a larger development of the faces of 7’{201} than in the other groups of
double selenates studied. A similar fact was observed with respect to the ferrous
iron group of double sulphates. Crystal Elements and Angles.—The axial angles and axial ratios are compared in
the following table. Comparison of the Axial Angles and Axial Ratios.

| Axial angle. | Axial ratios.

| B. / Git Disinied
Potassium ferrous selenate . . | 103° 50’ | 0°7490:1:0°5044
Rubidium _—s,, % imei! 104° 57’ | 0-7424:1:0°5000

The differences between the morphological axial angles of the three alkali metallic
salts are 1° 7’ between the potassium and rubidium salts, 1° 5’ between the rubidium
and cesium salts, and 2° 12’ between the potassium and cesium salts.
