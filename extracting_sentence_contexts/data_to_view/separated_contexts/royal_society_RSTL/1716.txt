BxssEL is certainly correct. But if we suppose that the specific gravity of the
moving mass is not restored to the specific gravity of the metal by suffering
the tube to be filled with water; and that the pendulum can be considered in
no other light than as consisting of a cylinder filled with water, instead of a
cylinder filled with air; (the specific gravity of which, instead of being 8:3, will
probably not be 80 much as 2:8 ;) the yalue of the result will be materially
altered. In fact, if the specific gravity were only 25, the value of 2 would be
only 1-85 : which differs yery little from the value deduced by M. BxsstL from
the experiments with the c/osed cylinder. Now, I find (from the data furnished
by M.
