Wacumr (1927,
p. 316) states that the moving up of this tubercle towards the endite portion of the
limb gives a false impression of a biramous constitution. There is no evidence, however,
that the duct is moving towards the middle line, but rather the reverse, as in the
Anostraca it opens on the limb itself. Its position so far removed from the middle line
and â€˜pointing outwards is probably correlated with the fact that in the Notostraca
there is little, if any, forward current along the mid-ventral line, certainly in the region
behind the mouth. Hence there will be no continuous stream of water to sweep away
the excretion as it leaves the duct, and so the opening of the duct is placed at a distance
from the mouth. Similarly, in Limnetis which, like the Notostraca, is a mud-eater,
the opening of the maxillary duct is on a tubercle situated immediately outside the
maxillules, the remainder of the maxilla having disappeared.
