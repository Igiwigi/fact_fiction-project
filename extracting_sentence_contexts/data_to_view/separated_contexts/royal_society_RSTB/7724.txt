All 36 B. mallet in the current B. pseudomallei MLST
website, recovered from worldwide sources over a
period of 40 years, are identical by MLST (excepting
one isolate that differs at only a single nucleotide site in
one of the seven loci). This ‘species’ can therefore be
considered to be a strain (or clone) of B. pseudomallei
that has been historically given a separate species name 5. SPECIES WITHIN SPECIES
