It is sharply marked off from the atria by a well-developed coronary
sulcus. Its apex is very bluntly rounded, and in one of the specimens examined
bore short processes resembling the gubernaculum cordis that Bepparp has stated
to be present generally in the Lacertilia(3). The base of the ventricle is not quite
at right angles to the long axis of the heart owing to the fact that the right
shoulder is far more rounded off than the left. On the other hand, however, the
left auricle overhangs the ventricle more than the right. The dorsal wall of the
ventricle is more flattened than the ventral.
