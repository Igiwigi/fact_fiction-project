Those of the earliest age presented also scarcely any change in size or in the appear-
ance of the yelk. With all imaginable care and pains I sought in all for the germinal
vesicle, but in vain. The disappearance of this structure therefore in mammals also
(where hitherto it has been admitted only hypothetically), I believe myself enabled
to pronounce as a decided fact. In an impregnated bitch, which I examined 19
hours after the first coitus, and where I found the ova still in the ovary, the germinal
vesicle was present. It thus probably disappears just on the exit of the oyur from
the ovary.
