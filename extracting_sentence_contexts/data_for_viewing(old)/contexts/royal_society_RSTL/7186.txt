Bf the surface sends its superfluous water to the Atlantic. This greater quantity of
Iresh water from the land, and the greater quantity of salts in the corresponding sea,
Seem to contradict each other, but can be explained by a higher temperature, and, as the
Zesult of this higher temperature, a greater evaporation.

D Some of the large bays of the ocean have in the tropical or subtropical zone a greater
Mean than the Atlantic: such are the Mediterranean, with 37-936 per 1000 salt (mean
Zf eleven observations); the Caribbean Sea, with 36-104 per 1000 (one observation) ;
Fe Red Sea, 43-067 per 1000 (mean of two but little differing observations), which is

e greatest salinity of the sea I know of.

2 In approaching the shores the sea-water becomes less rich in salts, a fact which finds
FR explanation in the more or less great quantity of fresh water which runs into the
Fea. On such shores where only small rivers flow out, the effect produced is but very
Irifling, as, for instance, on the western shores of South America. The effect of large
Sivers i in diluting the sea-water is much greater than is generally supposed ; thus the
"affect of the La Plata river, whose mouth lies in about 35Â® of S. latitude, was still
Sbservable in a sample of sea-water taken at 50* 3L' 8. lat., at a distance of 15* of lati-
Zude, or 900 English miles from the mouth of the river; at about the same distance,
he water of the North-Atlantic Sea suffered a considerable depression in salinity, pro-
Sably owing to the water of the St. Lawrence. This influence is of a double kind,
Fartly in diluting the sea-water, partly in mixing it up with organic substances that
will occasion its decomposition by putrefaction.
