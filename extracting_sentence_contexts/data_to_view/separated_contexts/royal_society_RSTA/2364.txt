This exponential decay assumption was
supported by a good correlation between the AE activity (defined as Amax cumulated over the
AE events population) and the global strain during creep tests on ice single crystals [55], as well
as by a T ~ In(Amax) scaling [33]. However, the last relation might also result from the scattering
of acoustic waves throughout the material and their reflection at the sample surfaces, generating
an exponentially decaying coda (e.g. [59]). This stresses the fact that (i) the interpretation of the
AE event duration T as the genuine dislocation avalanche duration and (ii) the proportionality
between Amax and the incremental strain Ep, have to be taken with caution. Whatever it may be,
Amax remains a useful proxy of the ‘size’ of the dislocation avalanche. However, in other systems exhibiting intermittent slip avalanches, such as sheared granular
media [60] or faults [61], the radiated acoustic/seismic energy E is considered as being
proportional to the dissipated energy at the source, hence to well characterize the corresponding
avalanche.
