which had not yet forked. It is of importance to note that continuous strands of
brown sclerenchyma often occur in the pith of sporelings of this species, and that like
the internal phloeoterma, which is equally characteristically present, they have no
communication with the similar tissues of the cortex outside. In sporelings of
O. regalis there is commonly differentiated a distinct layer of parenchyma on the
inside of the stelar tube, although I have never observed it to be separated from
the pith by a differentiated endodermis.

It is now in order to make suggestions as to the significance of the various
anatomical facts recorded for the Osmundacew in the foregoing paragraphs. In this
connection O. cinnamomea is the most interesting. According to the anatomical
conceptions put forward by Van TreaHem and Srraspurcer, the cauline central
cylinder of the Osmundacew is to be regarded as medullated monostelic, i.e¢., as
derived from a single concentric strand by dilatation and the formation of an intra-
stelar pith and medullary rays from the conjunctive parenchyma of the stele. The
pith, according to this conception, has no morphological affinity with the cortical
tissue outside. This idea answers quite well for O. claytoniana, and fairly well for
O. regalis. The case of O. cinnamomea, however, appears to be quite irreconcilable
with the hypothesis of medullated monostely of VAN TrecHeM and STRASBURGER.

In the first place we find in quite two-thirds of the example of this species
a very obvious communication and histological identity between the pith and
