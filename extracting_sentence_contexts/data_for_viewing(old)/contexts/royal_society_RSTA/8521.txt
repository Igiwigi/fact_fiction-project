We must now consider the types of solution which this equation yields, noticing,
in the first place, that since ¢(v) is an even function of a, as already shown,
¢ (x) {1 +e} is a mixed function (neither odd nor even). J,(x)/,/a is even, and
therefore / (x) is mixed, or has both odd_and even terms.

The equation has an infinite number of types of solution. None can be even functions
of x expressible as a Neumann series, for all such functions, as we have seen, satisfy
the homogeneous equation. :

Whether & (x) be odd or even, the integral is necessarily an even function of y, for
it is unchanged when the sign of y is changed. In fact, for any ¢ (a) the integral

Fy)=[ ¥@)K(eyde

is necessarily even in y.

Any number of solutions can be found as follows, involving both odd and even
functions of y :—

Let F, («) be any odd function of x giving a finite integral
