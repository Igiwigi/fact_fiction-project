inferior) makes the hind border of the fenestra rotunda. The cavum canaliculare
contains the utricle and the semicircular canals, the loops of which are separated
from the utricle by the septa semicircularia, The posterior part of the cavum
canaliculare gives off the sinus superior (through which the crus commune of the
anterior and posterior semicircular canals connects with the utricle), and expands into
the recessus utriculo-ampullaris posterior. This recess receives the lower opening of
the posterior semicircular canal, and the posterior opening of the lateral canal. Just
before opening into the recess, these canals communicate with one another by a
perforation in the septum semicirculare posterius. Owing to the fact that the fosse
subarcuatee (interna and externa) are shallow, the massa angularis (between the
posterior and lateral canals) is thick. The median wall of the cavum canaliculare is
perforated by the foramen endolymphaticum, and by the pressure-deficiency mentioned
above.

5. The ala temporalis.â€”The ala temporalis is a plate of cartilage attached to the
central stem by the processus alaris. The outer border of the ala temporalis is slightly
raised, and protects the ganglion of the trigeminal nerve from the side. A notch in
this raised edge serves for the passage of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal
nerve. The front of the ala temporalis reaches as far as the anterior (preoptic) root
of the ala orbitalis. On its median side, anterior to the processus alaris, the ala tem-
poralis gives off the pterygoid process, which is here of exceptional interest because
