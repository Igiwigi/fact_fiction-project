The size of the scales is on the whole similar over the
whole flank of a fish, but they decrease a little toward the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The scales on the fin webs are often extremely small. This mode of development of the
squamation gives the explanation of the remarkable fact that the scales of large speci-
mens of Acanthodes may be no larger than those of small individuals. The scales of the
specimens last considered are of the same size within the necessarily wide limits of
measurement. Those of the Edinburgh specimen, about 230 mm. in length, are about
twice as wide as those of the series above described.
