TyPEs OF ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOUR IN THE RING AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME

As the reader was reminded in § 2, after a lapse of time the behaviour of an expression of
the form of (6-11) is eventually dominated by the terms for which the corresponding p, has
the largest real part. There may, however, be several terms for which this real part has the
same value, and these terms will together dominate the situation, the other terms being
ignored by comparison. There will, in fact, normally be either two or four such ‘leading’
terms. For if p,, is one of them then py_,, = f,,, since

sin? (4) = sin’?

so that p,, and py_,, are roots of the same equation (6-8). If also p,, is complex then
Rp,, = Ap.) and so in all
Rp, res Rp, = Rpy-sy = BPs

One need not, however, normally anticipate that any further terms will have to be included.
