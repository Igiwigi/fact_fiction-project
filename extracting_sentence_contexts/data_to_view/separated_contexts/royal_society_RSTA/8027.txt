Equation (95) shows that the condition (75) is satisfied. Further, ¢ is constant on
any one of the family of hypersurfaces

whatever be ¢,. Whatever be ¢, a similar region is, in fact, built up of pieces of the hypersurfaces (88)
for which (91) is true. We shall give at this stage only a single example of this result, which will be illustrated
more fully when dealing with the best critical regions. Example (7).—A single sample of n from a normal population ; + unspecified.
