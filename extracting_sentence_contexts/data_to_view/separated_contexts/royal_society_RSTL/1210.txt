The alkalies produced were apparently dry, or at least
contained no more moisture than might well be conceived
to exist in the oxygene gas absorbed ; and their weights
considerably exceeded those of the combustible matters
consumed. The processes on which these conclusions are founded
will be fully described hereafter, when the minute details
which are necessary will be explained, and the proportions
of oxygene, and of the respective inflammable substances
which enter into union to form the fixed alkalies, will be
given. It appears then, that in these facts there is the same evidence
for the decomposition of potash and soda into oxygene and
two peculiar substances, as there is for the decomposition of
sulphuric and phosphoric acids and the metallic oxides into
oxygene and their respective combustible bases. In the analytical experiments, no substances capable of
decomposition are present but the alkalies and a minute

portion of moisture ; which seems in no other way essential
to the result, than in rendering them conductors at the
surface : for the new substances are not generated till the inte-
rior, which is dry, begins to be fused; they explode when in
rising through the fused alkali they come in contact with the
heated moistened surface ; they cannot be produced from
crystallized alkalies, which contain much water; and the
effect produced by the electrization of ignited potash, which
contains no sensible quantity of water, confirms the opinion
of their formation independently of the presence of this
gubstance.
