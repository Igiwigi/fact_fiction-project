Busseana, Stur, and R. Moyseyi, ARBER ; Anisopteris, including all the Lower
Carboniferous forms. OBERSTE-BRINK regards this as a more natural grouping of
the constituents of Rhacopteris, ScuimpER, considering, moreover, that it receives
support from the fact that this division of the genus corresponds to a stratigraphical
separation of no small order. OsrrsTE-BRINK states that no Rhacopterids have been
recorded from strata lying between the Middle Productive (Westphalian Series, Upper
Carboniferous) Measures and the Culm (Lower Carboniferous). Since it is doubtful
whether the division of the genus he suggests is a natural one, and not one with a
stratigraphical bias, it seems on the whole inadvisable to adopt this nomenclature.
