The Point of Fecundation. 332, In my © Second Series,” it was stated that I had found Spermatozoa on the
ovary||. From the facts just mentioned, and those about to be recorded, it may, I
think, be inferred that the fecundating element of the seminal fluid penetrates, not
only into the ovary, and into the interior of the oyum, but into the germinal vesicle,

pearance after maceration (** Second Series,” 7. c., Plate V. fig. 89. b.), for each of the several layers of incipient
cells into which a nucleus resolves itself, we shall hereafter find frequently to become circumscribed by a
proper membrane. + Resembling that figured by R. Wacxer in a very mature ovarian oyum of the Frog.
