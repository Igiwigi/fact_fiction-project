In consequence partly of the want of sections on the flank of a
rowing cone, and partly of inattention to facts supposed to be of no theoretical interest. "ave fail, in spite of the high scientific attainments of 80 many of the observers, to obtain
Sn any one instance the three data of which we stand in need. Some record the thick-
es, others the width, others the dip of a given lava-current, or the slope down which
-It flowed; some few mention two of these conditions, but no one all three; till less do
Ahey record facts respecting variations in breadth, depth, and inclination at various
Points between the summit and base of the coneÂ®.
3 In S. v. WaLmer8HausEN's great map of Etna, we perceive that certain currents,
Jadiating in various directions from the highest crater and platform (se Map, Plates
IX. and L.), have the appearance of narrow stripes, yet prove, when measured at
Aight angles to their course, to have a width of from 300 to 1800 feet. We cannot
Hscertain their average depth, but, judging by their external form, they probably exceed
thickness most of the old layas intersected in the Val del Boye.
