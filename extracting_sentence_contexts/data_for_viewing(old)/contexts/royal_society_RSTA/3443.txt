should consist of all possible splits. As every dichotomization creating a split should be applied
to all rvs sharing a conteNt, one ends up replacing the system R with

1 1 1 1 1
Dias [oo | Diy Dia fo | Pig fo | Panay | c=
2 2 2 2 2. _
Dii-2) Dip, Dy-2,-1) Diq2) Dra | c=2
q=l{-2) qe 12} q=U-2-1) gq 10,2). g = 2(1,2) | D |.

There are (2° — 2)/2 = 15 distinct dichotomizations of the set {—2, —1,0, 1,2}, and the 15 subsets
W in Diw should be chosen to avoid duplication, such as in Dito) and Diy-2,-12)- Once
duplication is prevented, however, all splits of all rvs one is interested in should be included.
It is irrelevant that some of them can be presented as functions of the others. In fact, any split of
our Rf can be presented as a function of just three splits, chosen, e.g. as

oo <p < _
Dy =Paay Par =Paoay Par = Parry:


It is easy to show, however, that in the subsystem

Di | Dt, | Di, || f(D},D},,Dj,) | c=1
Di | Di, | Diy || f(D},D},,Di,) | c=2

q=V q=1" q=1" q* D!
