In V. the percentage of salt is ‘472 in saliva secreted at a
rate of *400 cc. a minute, so that, allowing an increase of ‘004 per cent. for each
‘01 cc. increase in rate, the percentage of salts in saliva secreted at a rate of 5 ac. a
minute would be ‘512. Hence, the saliva in I., secreted at a rate of *9 c.c. a minute,
contains ‘616 per cent. of salts, ¢.e., a higher percentage of salts than sample VI. On the other hand, the difference in the percentage of salts between IT. and III.
cannot be altogether satisfactorily explained in this manner. ‘The saliva III., secreted
at a slower rate than II., should have a lower percentage of salts; in fact, the per-
centage of salts in it is higher. It is true that a portion of III. may have been
secreted at a faster rate than any in IL, for in III. 48 ¢.c. were secreted at a mean
rate of 1:2 c.c., and, as the rate of secretion slackened towards the end of stimulation,
the rate was, of course, considerably faster than 1:2 c.c. a minute at the beginning of
the stimulation ; but, in view of the slight increase in the percentage of salts which
occurs as the rate of saliva approaches its maximum (cf. p. 117), this explanation is
insufficient. It is possible that the increased percentage of salts may have been due
to the blood-flow through the gland being in this case less than normal (¢f. p. 126).
