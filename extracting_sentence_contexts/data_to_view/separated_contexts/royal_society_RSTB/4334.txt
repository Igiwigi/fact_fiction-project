type, are an essential part of this communication, and are not merely repetitions of
statements made elsewhere in the text. Data AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. It is not necessary to deal separately with the methods employed in procuring
the data, as they were simply variations on those described in the two preceding
Parts.
