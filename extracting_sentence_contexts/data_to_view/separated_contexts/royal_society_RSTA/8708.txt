The results for epicentral distances
from 0 degree up to 180 degrees are shown in fig. 1. We may note that the point of
inflexion on the time curve is very ill-defined, and might easily escape detection by
direct observations of the time. The direct measurement of the angle of emergence is, however, fairly precise, and
from such measurements we can, in fact, calculate the time curve more accurately than
we can determine it by direct observations of the time. We may further note that the time increases but slowly for the first 1000 km., and
since the angle of impingence for this region is not far short of 90 degrees, the true P
might escape observation by horizontal seismographs, since the ground motion is almost
entirely vertical. Passing to waves reflected at the surface, we consider first waves which maintain their
longitudinal character throughout.
