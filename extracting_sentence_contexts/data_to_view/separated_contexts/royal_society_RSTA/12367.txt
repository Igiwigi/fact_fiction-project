This agrees with the result previously stated. Returning now to the part of the discriminant arising from the two systems of roots
of (90) and (91), it will be shown that the factor @ arises entirely from one of the
systems only. Consider, in fact,

(¢Z, + #X, — yY,) (864, + #X, — yY),

which is the part of the discriminant due to the system of roots X,, Y,, Z). It is equal to

(62, + €X)) (362, + EX) = Z? {8 + 4€¢ (X,/Z,) + & (X,/Z,)*}

Therefore
