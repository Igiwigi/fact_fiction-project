The spectra at common pressure (C.P.) are in general magnificent objects. Their
ground seems to be a continuous spectrum, of which, however, the brightness yaries very
much with different substances and at different parts. Sometimes, especially at the
violet end, this ground is $0 faint that its presence might be questioned; but I belieye it
exists even there. On this are, as it were, superposed luminous lines of every degree of
brightness, from a splendour almost insupportable, to a faintness such that (at Jeasb
with my optical means) the least glimmer of diffused light in the telescope totally effaces
them. Most of these lines are (as might be expected) as broad as the image of the
lit: a few are much broader, eyen to six or seven times. Such are, I think, always
cloudy and ill defined, giving the impression that they are groups of finer lines, which
the optical power is insufficient to separate. In several instances this is shown to be
the fact by the combination of two fluid prisms of 60* (2BS.C), of which the two most
remarkable are those which I call Z, in the green, and z‚Äù, at the beginning of the violet.
The first was 8een in the Merz pris as a broad bright band, but it is a crowd of very
fine lines, of which the central one is much the brightest; and some of the others are

developed in different spectra: the 8econd (not resolved in Duboscq) consists of six
bright and sharp lines. Even this power fails to decompose the remarkable blue-green
and violet bands which characterize the hydrogen spectra C.P. Perhaps a third prism
might, but there is no room for it on the theodolite.
