alloys rich in lead, show a further recalescence occurring in the solid alloys. In one
direction this recalescence has been traced down to the alloy containing 8 per cent.
of tin, while in the other it can just be detected by delicate means in the alloy
containing 60 per cent. of tin (just below the eutectic concentration). The tempera-
ture at which this arrest-point occurs in the cooling of these alloys is lowest in the
8 per cent. alloy, and attains a maximum temperature at a concentration of about
18 per cent. of tin, occurring at this highest temperature in all alloys richer in tin up
to, or nearly up to, the eutectic alloy, where the arrest ceases to be observable. As
will be seen from the diagram of fig. 30, this maximum temperature is 149° C., while
the lowest temperature found in the 8 per cent. alloy is 72°C. As the temperature
at which this recalescence occurs falls to this low point at a tin content of 8 per cent.,
it was at first supposed that the non-observation of the arrest in alloys of lower tin
content might be due to the fact that the temperature at which the recalescence
occurs had fallen down to or even below the ordinary temperature. To decide this
question, both heating- and cooling-curves of alloys containing 2 per cent. and 4 per
cent. of tin and also of pure lead were taken down to very low temperatures by means
of liquid air and a thermo-couple of Iron-Constantan.

For the purpose of obtaining a cooling-curve over this low range of temperatures
the specimen of metal into which the thermojunction had first been inserted was
wrapped in thick asbestos cloth and first gently warmed to a temperature just above
