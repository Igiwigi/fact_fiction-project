CHROMOSOME LINKAGE IN CERTAIN OENOTHERA HYBRIDS. 371

The buds in both reciprocal hybrids and all their descendants through five generations
(1753 plants) showed the dominant red of rubricalyx. The significance of this important
fact will be discussed later.

The I, of the reciprocal, Oe. ammophila x (biennis x rubricalyx), is very different.
A single F, family (3-23) of 27 plants was grown. The two parental plants were the
same individuals as in culture 1-23, and all later generations are descended from these

reciprocal crosses between the same two individuals. The F, rosettes had midribs
which were white above, pale red below, the stems were erect (fig. 4) with long basal
branches, and the leaves grey-green. The plants were of a single uniform type and
showed the dominant red buds of rubricalyx. The rosettes were somewhat smaller
than the reciprocal and the stems had less diffuse red pigmentation.
