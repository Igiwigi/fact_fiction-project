Precisely of the same character is the difficulty
noticed by Lieutenant HENNESSEY in his paper on ©* Actinometrical Observations in
India.” Like LesL1E he speaks of variations, the causes of which are not ascertained,
« Again,” he says, © there is a change of intensity from day to day apparently not due
to alterations in the sun's declination, 80 that the average daily curve (about noon)
is higher or lower without any visible reason.”* The reason here is that applicable in
LesL1E's case ; namely, the variations of the invisible atmospheric vapour. In 1866 my friend Professor Soker of Geneva favoured me with a letter from which
the following is an extract :—*© In two comparative experiments, made within a few
days at Geneva and Bologna, the most powerful radiation was obtained at Geneva,
although at Bologna the heavens were visibly purer. The result appears to me to
support your views regarding the aqueous vapour of the air ; for the tension of aqueous
vapour at Bologna was 10-7 while at Geneva it was only 6:38.”

Cautiously abstaining from drawing a general conclusion from a single fact, M. Sorwn,
in 1868, made some further experiments on solar radiation. The intensity was meagured
by first allowing the rays to fall directly on the thermometer of the actinometer, and
then by allowing them, prior to meeting the thermometer, to pass through 5 centi-
