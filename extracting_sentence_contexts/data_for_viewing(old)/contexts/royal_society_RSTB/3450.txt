of the embryo-sac-tubes, were misinterpreted as stages in amitotie division from
which, it was erroneously suggested, the sexual nuclei resulted.§

Frequently the fusion-nucleus undergoes an immediate mitosis (figs. 33%, 350, 36).
Whether it occurs at once or is delayed for a time, the number of chromosomes
is very large and not the same in different nuclei—a fact which is no doubt due to
the unequal numbers of constituents taking part in the fusion. In this division the
new cell-wall is laid down in a cell plate in the usual manner (fig. 36). As a result
of these cell divisions, the lower part of the sac enlarges, passing through the stages
outlined in figs. 89, F-H. This primary growth, which occurs before fertilisation,
ceases at about the stage of 89H. A more considerable secondary growth commences
after fertilisation. The endosperm-tissue, both primary and secondary, is characterised
by a marked irregularity in the size of its cells. This seems to be due to the fact
that when division occurs the daughter-cells are smaller than those from which they
originated, and with successive divisions the difference becomes more marked.
Consequently throughout its life the endosperm consists of cells, large and small and
of intermediate sizes, irregularly intermingled (fig. 88).|| In cases in which fertili-
sation does not take place, the sterile tissue which fills the lower part of the sae
(fig. 89H) undergoes little further growth, and eventually becomes disorganised.

An embryo-sac-tube has been figured (fig. 30), in which all the nuclei have fused.
If the product is a fusion-nucleus, homologous with that of a primary endosperm-cell,
it should, in the ordinary course, undergo mitosis, and proceed to form a tissue.
A fusion-nucleus in this position has only been seen twice, and it is clearly of rare
occurrence, The structure shown in fig. 37 is contained within an embryo-sac-tube,
