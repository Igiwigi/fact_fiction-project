{M1, Mi} in the ‘shifted’ formulation reads: extremize the functional S[W; + AW] with respect

to AW, under the constraints Mj[Wy + AW] = My and My[W; + AW]= Mr. Let us denote as

AMy = My — My(M)) deviations of the moments My from their values in the quasi-equilibrium
state Wy. For small deviations, the entropy is well approximated with its quadratic part

Taking into account the fact that M;[Wy] = My, we come to the following maximization problem:

AS[AW] > max, Mj[AW]=0, My[AW] = AM. (3.1)

The solution to the problem (3.1) is always explicitly found from a (k + 1) x (k +1) system of
linear algebraic equations for Lagrange multipliers. This triangle maximum entropy method was
introduced in the context of the Boltzmann equation in [8].

In the remainder of this paper, we deal with the one-moment near-equilibrium closures: Mj =
Mo (i.e. Wi = Wea), and the set My contains a single moment M = fmWdx, m(x) 4 1. We shall
specify notations for the near-equilibrium FPE, writing the distribution function as W = Weg(1 +
w), where the function W satisfies an equation
