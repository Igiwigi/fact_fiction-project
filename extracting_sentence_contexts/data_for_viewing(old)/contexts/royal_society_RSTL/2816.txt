but this effect bears too strong an analogy to other chemical results to be
wholly separated from them, although what we call life, whatever that may be,
is necessary to its production.

The same effect, and one certainly of a very complicated nature, is here
produced by the nervous power and a chemical agent ; because when the latter
is substituted for the former, the same effect takes place, It is a simple matter
of fact. But it is maintained by some gentlemen that the same effect may be
produced by a mechanical agent*. They have related sevyeral experiments
which appeared to them to prove, that when after a part of the eighth pair of
nerves is removed, and thus the due secretion of gastric juice prevented, it may
be restored by mechanically irritating the cut ends of the lower portions of
the divided nerves. If such be the fact, it must materially influence our views
both with respect to the function of digestion and the other secreting processes
of the animal body.

In judging of the result of such experiments, several things must be taken
into the account which appear to have escaped the attention of those gen-
tlemen.

At the time the animal is fed, in preparation for the experiment, there may
be some food in the stomach, from previous meals, more or less digested, and
there is always some gastric juice ready to act on any new food which may be
presented to it. It is evident therefore, that although the secretion of gastric
Juice ceases at the moment of the excision of part of the eighth pair of nerves,
