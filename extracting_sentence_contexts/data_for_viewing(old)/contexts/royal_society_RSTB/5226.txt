The frequency gradient is, therefore, clearly of widespread occurrence, and in the case
of elongated leaves there is a fall in stomatal numbers in the apical region. Even in
small Dicotyledonous leaves there is sometimes an appreciable fall in stomatal numbers
at the extreme tip as compared with the penultimate region.

It naturally follows from the fact that the growth of a leaf is mainly interealary, and
that the leaf base and the leaf tip are the first formed or oldest parts, that these are also
the least exposed, since they attain maturity whilst still protected by the surrounding
leaves. Thus the leaf base and the leaf tip develop in a more humid atmosphere than
the later formed and intercalated middle region. Moreover, in the elongated
monocotyledonous leaves such as those of Luzwa maxima it is easy to see that, as the
leaf matures, its protection by the older surrounding leaves becomes less and less, so
that the successive basipetally intercalated portions of the lamina develop under
increasingly drier conditions. That the high frequency towards the base was not the
outcome of immaturity was shown by marking the young leaves at equal intervals
horizontally, when it was found that this region had ceased elongating.

Thus the data as to frequency distribution upon the individual leaf are consistent
