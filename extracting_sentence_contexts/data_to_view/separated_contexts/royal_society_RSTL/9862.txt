Soc., vol. 6), the area of land is about four-fifteenths of the whole area
of the earth's surface. Now, in the ideal undulations we are here considering the area above water is
about one-tenth of the whole area; hence in this respect the analogy is not 8atisfactory between these
undulations and the terrestrial continents. Tf T have not considerably oyer-ostimated the average depth
of the 8ea (and T do not think that T have done 80), the discrepancy must arise from the fact that actual

| continents and sea-beds do not present in 8ection curves which conform to tho harmonic type; there must
| also be a difference between corrugated spherical and plane surfaces.
| The geological denudation of the land mnst, to some extent, render our continents flat-topped. â€”Added
