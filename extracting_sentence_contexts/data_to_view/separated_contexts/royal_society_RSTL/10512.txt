The question as to whether the phenomenon was due to the fact that in the thicker
film the liquid is falling more or less rapidly was answered by closing the cock until
the down-rush was practically over. When communication between the films was
restored the thicker one contracted as usual. The fact that the film contracted if it was 8lowly thickened from below by the
electric current pointed to the same conclusion. Eeperiment V. It was, in the next place, important to determine whether the gradual disappearance
of the liquid rings by which the thinning film is attached to the solid supports could
produce changes in the value of Y which would account wholly or partially for the
phenomenon obseryed. ;

If an unduloid differs but little from a cylinder of radius Y, we may write for its
maximum and minimum ordinates Y+dez and Y+d8.
