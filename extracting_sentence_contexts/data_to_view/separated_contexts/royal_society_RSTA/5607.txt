]. Introduction

For thousands of years, the epidemic spreading of diseases has been one of the greatest threats
to societies around the world. Now, with increased mobility, diseases tend to spread faster and
wider due to air traffic and, in fact, often globally. The resulting pandemics can cost the lives of
millions of people and disrupt social, economic, public, political and cultural life. These challenges are increasingly countered with new measurement and vaccination
technologies [1].
