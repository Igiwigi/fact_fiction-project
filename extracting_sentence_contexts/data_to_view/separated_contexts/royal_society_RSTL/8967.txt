Now the high degree of sensitiveness

8hown by the ganglia to the smallest degree of such traction is quite as remarkable as
is their lack of sensitiveness to disturbances going on in the polypite*. Consequently

* When a specimen of Sarsic is taken out of the water, laid on an object-glass, slit open along one side, and
spread out flat with its inner surface uppermost, and then has its polypite turned back as represented in the figure
on Þ. 697, it may be obseryed that the bell often responds to irritations of the polypite, even thongh care be taken
to release the latter from the forceps before it is allowed to pull on its point of suspension. This may possibly
be due to the fact of the polypite mecting with some frietion on the glass during its process of retraction, which
friction must eanss it to pull very «lightly on its point of snspension, At any rate, if it is due to neryous con-

4 nexions between the substance of the polypite and the marginal ganglia, the conducting-power, as extimated by
. tho response of the distant tissue, is much less in the direction we are now considering than it is in tho conyerse

we have in this a very conclusive proof of the truly reflex character of the action we
are considering ; for after the removal of the marginal ganglia, the mutilated nectocalyx,
although it remains most keenly sensitive to the gentlest stimulation applied to its
own irritable tissues, will allow itself to be dragged through the water as rapidly as -
possible by means of the polypite without giving a single contraction.
