riments of various electricians prove, that by the friction of
sulphur and metals, the sulphur becomes positive and the
metals negative ; the same thing I find happens from the con-
tact of an unexited cake of sulphur and insulated metallic
plates. Mr. W1Lkt has stated an exception to lead, as rendering
sulphur negative by its friction. The results that I have ob-
tained with lead, in trials very carefully made, are the same
as those with other metals.* Sulphur, by being rubbed or
struck against newly-polished lead, always became poxitive.
Mr. WiLkt perhaps was misled by using tarnished lead : sul-
phur, I find, rubbed against litharge, or lead the surface of
which has been long exposed to air, becomes negative ; and
this exception being removed, all the facts on the subject are
confirmations of the general principle.

* As sulphur is a nonconductor, and easily excited by slight friction, or small
changes in its temperature, some caution is required in drawing conclusions from the
experiments in which it is employed. Sulphur, examined immediately after having
been heated, gives a positive charge to conductors, agreeing in this respect with the
alkaline substances ; and a Slight contact with the dry hand is sufficient to render
it negative, In general likewise in experiments of contact care should be taken that
the metallic plate is free from electricity: well polished plates of copper and zinc will,
1 find, receive a negative charge from being laid on a table of common mahogany,
