Solar-diurnal Variation.â€”The almost extreme difference in the normal direction of
the magnet, geographically considered, at Port Kennedy and Point Barrow, gives a more!
than ordinary importance to the comparison of the facts of the solar-diurnal variation
at the two stations, rendering it an apt illustration, in an almost extreme case, of the
laws by which this class of phenomena is regulated. Magnetically speaking, the mean'
direction of the magnet is necessarily the same at the two stations; that is to say, the
mean pointing of the marked end of the magnet, which we usually term its north pole, is
to the magnetic north; but in a geographical sense this direction is at Port Kennedy
about 35* to the West of South, and at Point Barrow about 41* to the East of North.
The localities afford therefore in this respect a contrast nearly as great as can exist in
any part of the globe; since magnetically the directions are the same, whilst geogra-
phically they want only 6* of being 180? apart, or diametrically opposite. The value
of this contrast appears when we proceed to consider the facts of the solar-diurnal vari-
ation at the two stations, and perceive rightly their important bearing on the correct
understanding of its true nature and character, and of the physical relations which
must be inyolyed in any well-grounded explanation. |

To prevent, as far as may be possible, misconception in the minds of those to whom
the 8ubject is not familiar, it may be premised that in speaking of the direction of the
magnet the eye of the observer is here supposed to be at its middle, and directed towards
the marked or north end; a change of direction towards the magnetic east will thus be

to the observer's right, and a change towards the west to the observer's left. Now the

most, marked features of the solar-diurnal variation, and which are found to prevail
