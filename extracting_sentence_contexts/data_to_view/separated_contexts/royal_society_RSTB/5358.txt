The process of ossification commences with a breaking-down
of both dorsal and ventral perichondria, although Rosin and BarpEEN maintain that
the dorsal perichondrium alone is ruptured. In conclusion to this part of the discussion, it might be pointed out that the bulk of the
centrum is not derived from the interventralia, which contribute only to the postero-
ventral portion of each vertebra. Hence, if the criterion which determines a Gastro-
central vertebra is the fact that interventralia form the major portion of the centrum,
then the mammalian vertebra as illustrated by that of Mus is not of this type, as Gapow
maintained. Discussion—Perichordal Disc. Froriep found that in the early stages of development of the vertebral column,
the “ primitiver Wirbelbogen” halves (=basidorsals) are fused with each other in the
median line, both above and below the notochord.
