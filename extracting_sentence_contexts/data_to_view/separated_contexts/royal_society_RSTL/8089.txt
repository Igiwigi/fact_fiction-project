To this I would answer that, although these fibres are not,
Actually shortened, yet the elements composing them have tended to asnme the con-
Alition that ordinarily accompanies contraction of the fibre (see below). And this
-Spinion is fully confirmed by Brtcxr's statementf, that the isotropous disks are always
:Sroadest in such fibres as have been prevented from shortening at the time of death. t is, in fact, as if we took a fibre that had become fixed at death in the contracted
tate and mechanically stretched it out to its original length; in which case we may
Feadily conceive the anisotropous and isotropous disks which are present in that state of
he fibre to be equally stretched out. S

2 And here I am tempted to offer a conjecture respecting the probable changes which
take place during the contraction of muscle in the disposition of the structures which I
Have endeavoured to describe.
