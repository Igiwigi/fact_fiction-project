Iron ships, I need hardly say, display very
tle change of form or breakage when launched, the character of the materials and
KAstenings used in their construction being 80 much less yielding than those employed
EY wood ships, 80 that they resist more successfully strains of equal intensity. SThe severest 8trains connected with the launching of ships are, however, those which
Fcasionally result from partial launches. The well-known case of the early iron ship
Prince of Wales illustrates this statement ; as, owing to an accident to the launching-
ar, she was left ſor some time with her bow resting on the edge of a wharf and her
Kern supported by the water—in fact suspended by the extremities; but although s0
Sverely strained no breakage took place. Another case in point is found in the wood
Ene-of-battle ship © Czesar,' which stopped on the launching-ways at Pembroke Yard in
$853, and remained for seventeen days with about 64 feet of the stern unsupported by
ound-ways. 'The result was that the stern drooped about 2 feet in a length of 90 feet.
