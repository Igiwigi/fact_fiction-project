—24t—8q+18r=(—8n+16)b+(152—36)e—348+9y +4 — 6;+98—9;
and from these I deduce
44q+53 r=(44n—88)bÞ+(225 n—63)e—422 8 —$33 y—132 &—87i—22j— 2 % +580.

6. In No. 32 we have (without alteration) 0=16; but in the application (Nos. 40 and
41) to the surface FP*+ GR*Q*=0 we have 9=0, and there are «=fpq off-points, F=0,
P=0, Q=0, and ,=gpq close-points, G=0, P=0, Q=0. The new equations involving
@ are thus satisfied.

7. I have ascertained that the value of Þ' obtained, Nos. 51 to 64 of the memoir, is
inconsistent with that obtained in the © Addition” by consideration of the deficiency,
and that it is in fact incorrect. The reason is that, although, as stated No. 583, the
values of two of the coefficients D, E may be as8umed at pleasure, they cannot, in con-
junction with a given system of values of A, B, C, be thus assumed at pleasure; viz. A,
B, C being =110, 272, 44 respectively, the values of D, E are really determinate. I
have no direct investigation, but by working back from the formula in the Addition I
find that we must have D=477, K=315; the values of the remaining coefficients then are

F=95, G=—25, H=—1295, TJ=—198;
or the formula is
B'=2n(n—2)(11n—24)
