(b) Average properties of the magnetic field

Figure 4 shows that non-ideal effects influence the ‘shear’ component of the ideal Poynting flux
more, i.e. the one associated with the horizontal motions along vertical flux tubes. Since these are
the motions causing vorticity in the magnetized plasma, it is not surprising that Q- is affected
in a similar way. In order to clarify the reasons for this behaviour, we considered the average
properties of the magnetic field in all three runs.

The horizontal and temporal average of the vertical and horizontal components of the
magnetic field are displayed in figure 5. It shows that differences between the three models
are present only in the layers above the surface, in agreement with the fact that both Hall and
ambipolar effects are negligible in deep layers. This figure confirms what was already seen in
figure 3c,d, i.e. that the magnetic field is weaker in the upper layers of the AMBI run, and stronger
in the AMBIHALL run. Figure 5 demonstrates that this is true for both vertical and horizontal
magnetic field components. However, these components are affected to a different extent. The
ratio of By/Bz (figure 5c) reveals that the field that emerged to the upper layers is more horizontal
in the AMBI case, and is more vertical in the AMBIHALL case, compared to the BATT one. Therefore,
AMBIHALL simulation produces more vertical flux tubes. Since these flux tubes are necessary to
propagate vortical motions along them, this can explain an excess of the latter in the AMBIHALL
model.

Figure 6 illustrates the latter point further. It shows snapshots of the magnetic field strength
at an arbitrary time moment, in the upper photosphere. The differences in the structures formed
