other cases wrought iron was the basis, though there are only a small number of these.
The form represented by this specimen No. 20/C.1-9 would further seem to have been
very convenient for packing into the crucibles. The possibility that this specimen
represents the steel or iron base used in Farapay’s experiments on alloy steels has,
therefore, been specially considered later in studying the results of the chemical analyses
and micro examinations.

Group “ D” contains forged bars similar to those in group “ C,” though generally
somewhat more regular in their rectangular section. ‘The specimens are, however,
distinguished by having one or more sides polished. Here we seem to have some relics
of Farapay’s efforts in the direction of obtaining alloys suitable for mirrors. Specimen

No. 39/D.12 was, in fact, specially noticeable for the excellent mirror polish which it
possessed, in no way diminished after this lapse of time.

The specimen originally selected from the contents of the box for a preliminary
examination, prior to the investigation of the remaining 78, comes into this category
“DP.” Like No. 39/D.12 it had, in fact, a high mirror polish on one side, and was
also closely similar in its cross-sectional dimensions. For this reason it was allocated
the author’s Research number 39), and group number D.12.
