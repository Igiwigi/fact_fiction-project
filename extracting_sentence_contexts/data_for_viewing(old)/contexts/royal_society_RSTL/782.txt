we have, in this, case, no grounds to suppose that the leaves
derive their first nutriment from the crude sap.

It -is -also - generally admitted, from the experiments of
Boxxer and Du Hamer, which I have repeated with the same
result, that in- the cotyledons of the seed is deposited a quantity
of nutriment for the bud, which every seed contains; and
though. no. vessels' can be traced* which lead immediately
from the cotyledons to the bud or-plumula, it is not difficult to
point out a more circuitous passage, which is perfectly similar
to that through, which I conceive the sap to be carried from the
leaves to the buds, in the $ubsequent growth of the tree ; and
I am in. possession of many facts to prove-that seedling trees,
in the first stage of their: existence, depend entirely on the
nutriment afforded by the cotyledons ; and; that they are
greatly injured, and in many instances killed, by being. put to
vegetate in rich mould.

We: have: much more decisive evidence that bulbous and
tuberous rooted plants-contain the matter within themselves
which subsequently- composes their Jeaves; for-we see them
vegetate even in dry rooms, on the approach of spring ; and
many. bulbous rooted plants produce their leaves and flowers
with nearly the same. vigour. bythe application of water only,
