that the difficulties in deciding the corresponding question for the less well-defined
product obtained by charging platinum black with hydrogen can not easily be sur-
mounted, As far as we can see at present, the only solution to the problem is to be
got by a more minute study of the physical properties of the substance.

It must be admitted that the inference which we have drawn, viz., that any given
sample of platinum black occludes approximately the same volume of the different
gases, seems to point to the conclusion that we are dealing with some phenomenon
which is conditioned by the extent of the surface of the platinum black, as otherwise
it is not quite clear why hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and sulphur dioxide
should all be absorbed in equal volumes. On the other hand, we have to deal with
the equally significant fact that neither nitrogen nor carbon dioxide are absorbed
except in comparatively small quantity. If, however, we confine our attention to
the occlusion of oxygen by platinum black, the balance of the evidence which we can
bring forward at the present time seems to indicate the formation of a definite
compound or oxide.

Tf, in the first place, the occlusion of oxygen were merely the physical condensation
of oxygen in the capillary pores of the platinum black, we should expect that raising
the temperature would either have very little effect or would simply re-evaporate the
condensed oxygen, whilst, as a matter of fact, rise of temperature is accompanied by
increased absorption up to the temperature of about 360°-380° C., when the oxygen
is again given off.
