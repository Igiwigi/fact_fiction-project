As placental Mammalia, these types come, of necessity, into Professor HuxLey's
highest group —the © Eutheria ;” and yet in both the skull and the other parts of the
organization worked out by me, namely, the shoulder-girdle and sternum, they come
nearer at times to the Prototheria than the Marsupials themselves—that middle
group, the Metatheria.

Therefore it occurs to me, and the author whose terms I have just used will, I be-
lieve, agree with me in this view, namely, that these Edentata are the direct children
of the Prototheria. That they passed through a Metatherian stage is a thing nob to
be controverted, but I believe that it was not, in most cases at least, utilized—ib was
an abbreviated prenatal stage ; they lost their Marsupial bones and never acquired
any Marsupial modification of their abdominal skin. A great satisfaction now arises
to me from the fact that my very narrow line of research brings me to the reiteration
of Professor FLowER's views of the Edentata, inter 8e.

The Old World types are sharply divided from those of the New World ; but types
80 different in appearance and habits as the Sloth and the Ant-bear can be 8hown by
embryology, as well as by their general anatomical structure, to be, in reality, closely
related. Adaptive modification has done its utmost in these two cages ; but it has
only masked, it has not destroyed, the essential fundamental conformity of these two
grotesque and aberrant types of Mammals.

I need nob repeat here what I said in the Introduction as to my change of views
since the publication of my paper on the Pig's 8kull (Phil. Trans., 1874, Plates
28-37), as to the general homology of the * ossicula audits.” The researches of
