Judge
Edwards (Chairman of the committee who prepared the
NRC report) reacted strongly against that view and
suggested quite the contrary [67]: judges should account
for the NRC report in their decision-making regarding
admissibility. Judge Edwards made extensive reference to
the order by Judge Gertner.’? She indicated that although
the admissibility of this kind of evidence was effectively
presumed, largely because of its pedigree—the fact that it
had been admitted for decades—admissibility ought not
to be presumed but carefully examined in each case in
light of the NRC concerns. In Commonwealth v. Gambora,° Judge Spina took a strong
stance on claim of certainty: ‘Claims of absolute certainty
are particularly irresponsible by a science based in large
part on human judgment’.
