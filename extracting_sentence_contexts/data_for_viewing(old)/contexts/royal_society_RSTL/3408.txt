1. IN presenting an account of the following experiments to the notice of the Royal
Society, I am fully aware that the results are somewhat at variance with those ob-
tained by philosophers whose names are 80 eminent in science, that it may appear
presumptuous in me even to offer an opinion as to the correctness of their statements.
The discrepancy may very possibly arise from error on my part; but as the experi-
ments relate to facts and not opinions, I can only state that I present a faithful
record of those performed by myself with the assistance of two or three private friends,
and that this record is extracted from my note-book, wherein the experiments were
entered from day to day as they were performed.

2. Until some recent experiments of Dr. Jacop1* no one appears to have disputed
the correctness of Dr. Farapar's original experiment of a spark appearing before con-
tact, or before the circuit of a voltaic battery was completed, when consisting of a
Single pair of plates.

3. That a spark does appear when the contact is made on completing the circuit of
the voltaic battery, is well known to all who have experimented with that apparatus.
Dr. Faravay has shown that this spark can be produced eyen with a single pair of
