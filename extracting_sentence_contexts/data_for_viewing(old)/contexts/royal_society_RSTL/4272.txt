long in the line of the radius of the disk as they are in the transverse direction, their
long sides being parallel to each other. We shall hereafter see, however, that the
form of the superficial cells is very subject to variation, and that it may be very
dissimilar even in different zones of the same disk (| 48-52). The pores at the
margin of the disk are disposed, as in the simpler type, between the projections
formed by the convexities of the cells; and each is usually surrounded by the pro-
jecting annulus formerly noticed («| 19). The disposition of these pores, however, is
far from regular, as they seldom form rows that seem exactly continuous with each
other, either horizontally or vertically; and the number of pores in each vertical
row is by no means constant, even in different parts of the margin of the same
disk þ.

* I have elsewhere noticed the fact, that various species of Orbitoides are disposed to exhibit a like con-
tortion ; and that the well-marked ephippial shape which some specimens present, is nothing else than an acci-
dental variety (se Quart, Journ. of Geol. Soe., vol. vi. pp. 34, 35).

+ In following the description of the internal structure of this type of Orbitolite, it will be convenient for
the reader to make frequent reference to the ideal representation which has been built up in Plate V. fig. 6,
by the combination of materials furnished by a great number of preparations which are represented in separate
figures accompanying the original Memoir in the Archives of the Royal Society ; these last of course furnish

the real authority for every point in the description, the ideal figure, however, serving to display the relation
of different parts to each other in a manner that no single preparation would possibly admit,
