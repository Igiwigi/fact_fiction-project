he must mean Echidna-pterygoid, because the other pterygoid had then not yet been
discovered) des erwachsenen Schiidels von Ornithorhynchus verhilt sich dann zum
Palatinum, wie das knorpelige Pterygoid am foetalen Schidel bei Talpa.”’ The pterygoid
cartilage of Talpa can hardly fail to be homologous with the pterygoid cartilage of
Sorex, and as the latter can be regarded as the representative of the rep. pterygoid,

these considerations give additional reasons in favour of homologising the Echidna-

pterygoid with the rep. pterygoid. ;

Gaupp’s (1911) chief objection to the homology of the rep. pterygoid with the
mam. pterygoid is the fact that the former is related to the palato-pterygoid arch, .
whereas the latter enters into relations with the base of the skull. But Sorex shows
that the pterygoid cartilage 7s related to the visceral cartilage of the palato-pterygoid |

arch (ala temporalis) by cartilaginous continuity, at the same time as the dermal bone
behind it is related to the base of the neurocranium. It is only necessary to make this
modification in GAUPP’s view (viz., to regard the pterygoid of higher mammals as
composite) for it to fall perfectly into line with that which is advocated here: all his
other arguments will then hold. It may be mentioned that the pterygoid cartilage
does not exist in Echidna (Gauppr, 1905). This negative evidence, so far as it goes,
supports the present view ; for if it could be demonstrated that the pterygoid cartilage
