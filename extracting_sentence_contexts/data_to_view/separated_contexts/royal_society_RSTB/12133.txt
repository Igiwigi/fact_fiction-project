Here, we sorted lation of LysoTracker positive, pigmented eukaryotes, which
populations, or individual cells, of potentially mixotrophic consisted entirely of photosynthetic stramenopiles, more
protists from sites in the eastern North Pacific by FACS (see specifically the diatom genus Minidiscus (figure 5d). Diatoms

using acidotropic probes. For example, cells stained with Lyso- tion, and the signal most likely originated from the acidic silica
Sensor and sorted by FACS based on that signal from an deposition vesicles during the formation of their frustules [91].

scenarios. Both show localized staining resembling food vacu- the putative mixotrophs sorted later, it was higher than the con-
oles (figure 4b), but one also shows signal localization within trol. Notably, some members of the groups captured in May

acidic thylakoid lumen.
