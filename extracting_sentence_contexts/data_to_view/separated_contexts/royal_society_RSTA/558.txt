These asymmetries can produce considerable devia-
tions from the mean trajectory and are the primary cause of the characteristic high dispersion
of the rocket as compared with shell fired from guns. Accordingly, it is important to know
how the various asymmetries affect the motion, and which of them are of most importance,
so that care may be taken to ensure that the relevant manufacturing ‘tolerances’ may be
confined within as narrow limits as possible. A great deal of the complexity of the mathe-
matical theory is due to the fact that perfect axial symmetry is not a legitimate assumption. The mathematical theory applies to both rotated and unrotated rockets. Unrotated
rockets are usually stabilized by fitting fins near the rear end in order to ensure that the lift
moment is stabilizing.
