The castration effect must be
regarded as definitely proved. As to whether the suprarenal and the thyroid exert any effect on the oestrous cycle
in any way other than that they may be supposed to condition it, there is no clear
evidence. The facts have been well presented by SmrrH (1932), who supplies many
references. DEANEsLY (1928) has shown that in the rat and mouse a high percentage
of animals survive after adrenalectomy and that the cycles are normal or slightly
lengthened. Most other recent investigators have got similar results. â€˜The evidence
as to the thyroid is also unsatisfactory.
