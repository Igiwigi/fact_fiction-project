Jointed endopodite, flat, spiny exopodite and gill ; six pairs of pleopods, the last two
rudimentary ; and a seventh somite between the 8ixth abdominal somite and the
deeply-forked telson (* Ueber den Ban und die Systematische Stellung von Nebalia,”
Zeit. f. Wiss. Zool., xxii. p. 323-330), a very slight modification of this ancestral
Urophyllopod. »

He gives on pages 69-71 of his © Untersuchungen,” &c., a long, minute, and
extremely ingenious explanation of the way in which this Urophyllopod stage of
development became converted by secondary modification into the Malacostracan
Protozoia, and afterwards, by still greater modification in the same direction, into
the typical Zo#a of the higher Decapods.

The facts which have been detailed and tabulated with reference to the metamor-
phosis of the Sergestide and Penavs seem to substantiate at least a portion of this
view, and to show that the typical Zoza is a 8econdary modification of the Protozoa ;

but a comparison of these forms with the metamorphosis of FZuphansia, upon which
Cravs lays especial emphasis, seems to demand a directly opposite interpretation.

If the Zoza has been produced by a secondary modification of the Protozo#a we
