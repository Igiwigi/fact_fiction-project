role of bridging fibres in shielding a fatigue crack in long-fibre composites. The bridging stresses
have been quantified by high-resolution synchrotron diffraction for Ti6Al-4V/35% SCS-6 SiC
fibre composite [49]. The bridging stresses in the fibres are shown in figure 10. The crack-face
tractions arising from the bridging fibres are around 300 MPa at maximum load. Interestingly,
they are compressive (approx. —100 MPa) at Kyin which tends to prop open the crack. This is
partly due to the fact that the bridging fibres are pulled out somewhat at Kmax and partly due to
the original compressive thermal residual stresses in the fibres. Using a weight function approach,
it is possible to calculate the shielding effect of the crack-closing stresses at Kmax and the crack-
opening stresses at Kin. These are shown in §5b and act to greatly reduce the stress intensity
range experienced by the crack as more and more fibres bridge the growing crack.

3. Crack-tip imaging

As discussed by Stock [51], the narrowest crack opening that can be measured by tomography
is a function of the pixel size and the contrast difference. For aluminium viewed with a 40kV
laboratory source, Breunig et al. [52] suggest that a crack as small as 10% of the pixel size can be
measured. For polymer composites illuminated with X-rays from a 100kV source, a sensitivity
to cracks 20% of the pixel size has been quoted [53] improving to 5% if dye penetrant is used
