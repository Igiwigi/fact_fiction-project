sulcus. Finally, sections 21 and 22, which extend radially from the tip of the
calearine fissure, demonstrate the limit of the special lamination in these regions.

All the sections of the present and the later cases lie in the particular planes given,
as they are composed of smaller sections taken as accurately as possible at right
angles to the course of the convolutions concerned. This has added greatly to the
labour of the research, but has been absolutely necessary for the purposes of micro-
meter measurement. If the posterior portion of a hemisphere be cut into coronal
sections, it at once becomes evident how remarkably few regions are at right angles
to the course of the convolutions. In fact almost the only micrometer measurements
which could be obtained would be taken from the flat external surfaces or the
bottoms of the fissures.
