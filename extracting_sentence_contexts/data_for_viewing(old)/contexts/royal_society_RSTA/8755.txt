In the absence of magnetic media and convective dielectric polarisations these two
expressions satisfy the equation

M=-S,

but under the most general circumstances this relation is not satisfied.

We have so far conducted the discussions as though the quantity derived as a
momentum is unique and definite, whereas, as a matter of fact, this is far from being
the case. We saw that the idea of the momentum arose from certain outstanding
terms which remained when attempting to reduce the electromotive forces to a
’ representation by a stress system. Now we can give a number of different forms to
this reduction and. each one carries with it a different expression for the electro-
magnetic momentum. We can, for instance, write
