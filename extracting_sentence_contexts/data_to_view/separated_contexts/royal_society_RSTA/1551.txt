In this case, VR manifests as a series
of nonlinear resonances, the number of which depends on the number of coexisting states. Among
other results, related to the practical application of VR, one can mention the use of the concept of
VR applied to experimentally measured signals from sensors to enhance bearing fault detection
and weak faults in rotating machineries [30-34]. In fact, such an approach can be considered as
controllable nonlinear filtering based on the phenomenon of VR. Along with electric signals used in the experiments with a bistable VCSEL [6,15,16,18,20,21,23],
it has been experimentally shown that VR can be effectively used for enhancement of the response
of a VCSEL to the effect of periodic modulation of the orthogonal optical feedback [19]. In contrast
to this, we present here the results of experimental investigations of VR when the LF input signal
is the signal of periodically modulated optical injection from another VCSEL.
