The conserved quantity Q generates the symmetry in the sense that, under an infinitesimal
symmetry transformation, the change in any field ¢ is given by the commutator

$o(t,r) =ielO(t r), QI], (5.7)

where ¢ is an infinitesimal parameter. The fact that the symmetry is spontaneously broken means
that there is some field ¢ whose vacuum expectation value (0|¢|0) is not invariant under the
transformation, i.e. (0|[, Q]|0) 4 0. However, if Q is time-independent, this can happen only if
there are possible intermediate states with zero energy in the limit of zero momentum, in other
words massless particle states.

The development seemed to have reached an impasse. Spontaneous symmetry breaking
required the existence of massless spin-0 particles, which ought to have been easy to see.
Because none had been found, that appeared to rule the idea out. Weinberg commented on this
disappointing conclusion ‘Nothing will come of nothing; speak again!’, a quotation from King
Lear. Fortunately, however, we were eventually able to speak again.
