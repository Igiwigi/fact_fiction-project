standpoint—which could be supplied at once by various modes of approximation in
the majority of cases—has been included, largely from considerations of space. Such
modes of approximation are usually evident, and we deem it more appropriate, for
the time being, to confine ourselves closely to the mere determination of exact solutions
themselves, and their verifications. When, for example, a physical quantity, such
as the charge on the circular disc in various circumstances, has been expressed as a
definite integral which does not admit an evaluation in terms of known functions in the
general case, this integral supplies the simplest general solution possible, and its
evaluation by approximate methods when certain quantities are small or large is mainly
a mechanical process, and the inclusion of such processes in many cases would tend to
overload the discussion and to obscure the simple general lines of argument on which
all the results are based. We may state, however, that a definite integral has never
been left as such, unless its evaluation by approximate methods is, in fact, a simple
process,

The problems in this portion of the memoir are of a somewhat varied type, and in
no sense exhaustive. We have made a selection of the more interesting of those
whose solution is possible by the present methods.
