which at first the spore-formation must have been carried out, until, whe
embryonic branching, 7.e., the formation of the stem and its lateral members (1
took place, it passed over to the latter.”
Very much the same view was entertained by Naxncutr (‘ Abstammungsle
p. 476). Starting from the consideration of the steps of advance of the sporogo
of Liverworts, and distinction of a vegetative base from the sporogonial he
discussed the mode of elaboration of the latter, suggesting it as possible that
apex became vegetative, “and that the sporogonium developed as a lateral outg
on the apex; further that this sporogonium by further modification . . . . deve
into the leaf-bearing stem.” But he contemplated it also as possible “ thal
thallome-like sporogonium, as it became vegetative, may have extended din
(without a preliminary lateral branching) to the leafy stem.” He further ree:
fact that branching occasionally occurs in Moss-sporogonia, and suggests that
may have recurred repeatedly, in connection with continued apical growth of
whole. “With the continued growth of the sporogonium in length, the
producing portion of it behind the apex is raised aloft, so that a stalked sporogo
is the result. The lateral branches are also fertile, and develop as sessile sporo
Thus a strobiloid sporogonial system arises which is either the direct contin
the original thalloid body, or if, as was first assumed, a lateral sporogonium:
produced by branching, a lateral continuation of it” (p. 477). He then suggests
the sporogonia may have increased in size, and partially passed over to the veget
state, their main body becoming leaf-like, while the spore-production is limited to
of them: the result would be a leafy axis, of which all the leaves would be sporoy
