Thus the three consecutive samples 246, 247 and 248 give 58°0, 14°25

and 26°25 million bacteria respectively. The changes exhibited by any of the
species of protozoa are at times even larger, and affect the active and encysted
stages apparently quite indifferently. It is, in fact, not uncommon for the numbers
of any species to vary from a few hundred or a few thousand to 400,000 or more
within 24 hours, and the percentage of these in the active condition may jump from
0 to nearly 100 in a similar interval (e.g. Dimastigameba, samples 250, 251;
Cercomonas, samples 221, 222 ; Oicomonas, samples 245, 246; etc.). In spite of these apparently quite erratic daily changes, when the numbers are
averaged over a considerable period (e.g. fourteen days), marked seasonal changes
became apparent.
