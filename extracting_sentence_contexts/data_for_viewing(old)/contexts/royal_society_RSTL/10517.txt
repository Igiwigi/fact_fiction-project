660 DR. C. A. MAC MUNN ON THE CHROMATOLOGY OF ACTINIM.

(in the case of Anthea cereus), is probably identical with chlorofucin. To ee if thj
is the case I have figured the spectrum of chlorofucin in the natural condition j
PFucus 8erratus and in alcoholic solution, and on comparizon of these spectra with
those of the above-mentioned Actiniz a remarkable likeness is apparent. (See
spectra 8 and 9, Chart II.) : I

As I have already shown, the conclusion of KrUkexBERG®* that the colouring
matter of the yellow cells of Anthea cereus is identical with that of the hepato-
chromates (= enterochlorophyll) is not borne out by this fact ; viz., that in the
ease of enterochlorophyll no such change is produced by caustic alkalies as is produced
in solutions of the colouring matter of the © yellow cells” with these reagents.

Auother very remarkable fact noticed should go to support the view of the © yellow
cells” being symbiotic algae, namely, that they appear to cause a suppression of thoge
pigments which in other Actiniaz appear to discharge a respiratory function. In most,
if nob in all cases, this fact impressed itself strongly on my attention, and I believe
the observation is correct. At the 8ame time we must remember that the © yellow
cells ”—if they are 8ymbiotic algazz—only give oxygen up to the tissues of the animal,
which would still require to be ized in the tissues by a combination with something
else, such as actiniohzmatin or other pigments ; s0 that too much importance ought
not to be attached to the apparent absence or presence of such pigments in the
