An earlier theory, due originally to Wiechert and until recently strongly supported by
Gutenberg, was that microseisms are caused by the impact of waves breaking against a steep
coast. It is argued in favour of this theory that there is a statistical correlation between, for
example, the amplitude of the microseisms at Hamburg and the height of the waves off the
coast of Norway (â€˜Tams 1933). This theory will account for some of the facts, although it

involves a coefficient for the proportion of the wave energy imparted to the ground which
some may consider too high (Bradford 1935). Observations also seem to show that micro-
seisms associated with storms at sea may be recorded several hours before the waves reach
the coast (Banerji 1930; Ramirez 1940; Deacon 1949), so that a further explanation, at any
rate of these latter observations, is required. Possibly the most natural explanation of microseisms, and one that might have been
previously considered more seriously but for theoretical objections, is that they are generated
by pressure variations on the sea bed due to ocean waves raised by the wind.
