Evidence of such a displacement is to be found in the fact that, were the mandible of
the same specimen shifted forwards to its natural position, with the bifid extremity
embracing the curved-down extremity of the beak, as correctly restored by Huxtey, the
series of teeth with which its edge is beset would fall outside the series of maxillo-
palatine teeth instead of fitting, as they should, in the groove between them. This
crushing has also caused a fracture in the maxillary bone, a fracture which has been
regarded by BurckHaRpDT as a suture between maxillary and palatine ; but I have
been unable to convince myself of the existence of such a suture in the position
assigned to it by that observer. One proof of the distinctness of a toothed maxillary
bone from the palatine in Huxtery’s specimen lies in the fact that the dentigerous
edge of the right maxillary bone, as determined by Huxtey, has, through displace-
ment, become more widely separated, in the vertical direction, from the corresponding
palatine than the left on the same specimen ; a correct idea of the state of things is
conveyed by Huxtey’s figure 3, but not at all by Burckuaropr’s outline drawing,
a great fault with the latter being the omission of the maxillo-palatine groove which
is clearly visible in the skull from which his figure is taken, and better still in the new
specimen which is the subject of this note. I should have felt perfectly satisfied
from an examination of the specimen in the British Museum, that Huxey’s interpre-
tation of the tooth-bearing bones was correct. But the matter is further settled by
the skull entrusted to me by Mr.
