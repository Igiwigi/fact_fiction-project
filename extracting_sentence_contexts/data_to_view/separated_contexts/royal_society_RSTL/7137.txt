SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 855

The atomic theory may be compared to a sort of © abacus” or sImple mechanical instru-
ment which chemists have invented to facilitate their calculations. Tt is useless to Pre-
tend that any demonstration can be given of this theory, which, at best, can only be re-
garded as a possible hypothesis suggested by the facts; but nevertheless it has a very real
claim upon our consideration from the practical advantages which it has afforded in the
8tudy of the science. The atoms of the chemist fulfil a similar purpose in his calculations
to that fulfilled by balls in the estimation of probabilities. They afford a sImple and not
inaccurate image of the subject with which he is concerned, by which he is enabled to
reduce his problems to a concrete form, and thus at once to realize and to isolate them.
