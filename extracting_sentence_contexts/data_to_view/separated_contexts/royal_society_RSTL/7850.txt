The absolute maximum
moment, produced by the vertical forces has been found to be 12,000 foot-tons, and the
moment produced by the longitudinal pressure is therefore a little more than one fourth
of this amount. As compared with the © Minotaur,” we find, then, that the bending-mo-
ment due to longitudinal pressure is very much less in actual amount for the * Bellero-
phon ;" but that, in proportion to the moment resulting from the unequal distribution of
the weight and buoyancy, it is much larger in the shorter ship. This fact prepares us for
the conclusion arrived at by Dr. YouxG in his Report on the diagonal system,—that in the
short full ships of war in use at the commencement of this century the moment due to
longitudinal pressure sometimes amounted to more than one third of the maximum mo-
ment produced by vertical forces. Dr.
