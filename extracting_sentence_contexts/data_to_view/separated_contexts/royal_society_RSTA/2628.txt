To increase the performance of PVS, Koch et al. [43] discussed
the inclusion of cooling to increase its curing time, as well as the alternative of using a vacuum
to remove air bubbles trapped in the microstructures. However, the use of lower pressures might
accelerate the loss of humidity from the plant leaf and by this deteriorate the replication results. An additional important fact is that while epoxy resin and PDMS have the same curing time,
the increase in viscosity is extensively faster in epoxy resin, which reduces the working time
to about 45min, whereas in PDMS the increase in viscosity is much slower. This is relevant
when working with biological samples, considering that the loss in humidity can highly affect
the shape of the topographies of the leaf surface used as a master, thereby longer times of
curing will lead to greater deformation of the leaves. If the negative moulding material does
not harden quickly enough, the changes in the topography of the leaf master could eventually
be transferred to the negative replica.
