In the case of Pe =50, combining a high index with sufficiently long target time gives the
best proxy. This is apparent for s=1,2 with T=2, for example, as the initial variance decay
in these cases is very similar to the variance-optimizing perturbation OA(0, 5,50) but continues
to decay significantly beyond tf =5, implying a higher quality mixture. Clearly, then, this near
identical initial behaviour followed by further mixing gives further evidence that the mix-norm
is an excellent proxy for the variance measure and motivates its use in optimization problems.
However, one must be cautious with the index and target time choice, as certain combinations
perform better than others.

The mix-norm also appears to be a good proxy at larger Pe. As shown in figure 2, for flows
with Pe = 500, we can see that the optimal perturbation OA(0,5,500) has the steepest decay for
early times, unlike in the Pe = 50 case where all fields had a similar decay. In fact, we observe that
the variance-optimal field continues to decay up until at least the time t = 64. This is in contrast
to what was observed at Pe = 50 where the plot approaches a constant value, indicating purely
diffusive mixing, with no advection-enhanced homogenization. This is due to the persistence of
small-scale structures in flows at higher Pe which continue mixing after the chosen target time.

For later times t 2 5, there are also choices of s that yield better mixing properties than the
variance-based optimal perturbations. Mix-norms with any of the choices of index with a large
enough target time appear to outperform the mixing properties of the flow associated with
the variance-optimal perturbation OA(0,5,500). Interestingly, in some cases, particularly with
