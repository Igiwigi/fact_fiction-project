The theory of Gapow and Axpsorr cannot be applied to the development of the
vertebral column of Mus, because, in the first place, the intrasclerotomic fissure, the
existence of which these workers vehemently deny, is indubitably present (Plate 12,
fig. 7, i.sel.f.). That this fissure is not merely an attempt to explain the growth dorsal-

wards of the cells of a ventral pyramid and the growth ventralwards of the cells of a
dorsal pyramid is shown by the fact that the derivatives of these so-called pyramids
do not occur on opposite sides of it. On the contrary, the basidorsal (or the chief
component of the neural arch) and the basiventral (or rib-bearing element) occur in
each segment on the posterior aspect of the intrasclerotomic fissure, which separates
them from the elements giving rise to the interbasalia. If the views of Gapow and
Asporr were correct, the fissure would separate the basidorsal from the basiventral.
It is only by applying their nomenclature to structures according to the position of
these when the elements are in the position they finally occupy, without concerning
oneself with the assumed existence of “ pyramids,” that any degree of conformity is
obtainable. Nevertheless it must be emphasised that the position of the elements
suffers no change such as is maintained, all parts of the caudal sclerotomite consisting
ab initio of dense tissue clearly distinct from the looser tissue of the cranial sclerotomite.
Further, the protovertebr or primitive somites are not curved into an S-shape in Mus,
