Presupposing that the dwarf elephants of the Mediterranean region were all
derived from a common ancestor, the simpler construction of the molars of . cypriotes
might be explained on the assumption that this species was isolated and subsequently
differentiated from the parent stock, prior to a similar fate overtaking the Maltese
and Sicilian races. This is borne out by the fact that Z. cypriotes lived contem-
poraneously with H. minutus, a more generalised and primitive form{ than either
H., pentlandi or H. melitensis, the associates of the pigmy elephants of Malta and
Sicily. The geological evidence, as distinguished from the palaeo-zoological, also supports
this theory, for it appears probable that Cyprus became an island at an early period. On consulting the Admiralty Chart it will be found that there is no sabmerged bank
indicating a recent connection with the neighbouring mainland, but that, on the
contrary, the 200-fathom line is reached within a very short distance from the land
round the whole of the coast line.
