bly oblique form of this mineral can, in fact, only be established in an incontestable
nanner by the obliquity of the cleavages p and m on the plane perpendicular to that in
yhich the optic axes lie, because this obliquity is absolutely incompatible with a
linorhombic form, in which the plane of symmetry would be perpendicular to the
lane of the optic axes and to the bisector of their acute angle, in which, furthermore,
he twisted dispersion would be very strong. Heat changes the angle of separation of the optic axes by diminishing it in a
ensible degree. A plate only slightly oblique to their plane gave in air for the
ed rays = h
