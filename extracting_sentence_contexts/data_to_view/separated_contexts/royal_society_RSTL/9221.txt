SPOTTISWOODE AND 9. FLETCHER MOULTON

When the air-spark was lengthened, not only did the black bands get broader,
but, associated with the intensely bright bands, there seemed to be one or more other
bright bands, much fainter in character, and apparently narrower. Whether they
were in fact narrower it is difficult to Ylecide, as their greater faintness would perhaps
give them the appearance of being 80 ; but if it is the fact that they were narrower,
it is possible that this points to the main bright lines being broader than the image |
of the slit, which would show that the principal discharge occupies ome little time ;
on the other hand, the apparent width of the bright bands may be due to irradiation,
The subsidiary discharges may perhaps arise from the existence of return currents,
such as are evidenced by the appearance of negative discharge at the positive pole,
when an air: -gpark of consideraþle size is introduced, and also by the double effects which
tubes 80 constantly show when we try to produce the relief or non-relief-effects. A metal ring was now put round the tube about the middle of its length, and the
slit was 80 placed that the ring passed across ib about its centre. This ring was then
Joined snccessively to the air-spark and non-air-spark terminals, and to earth, and the
8lit examined in each case.
