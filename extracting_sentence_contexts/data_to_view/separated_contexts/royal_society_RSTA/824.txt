For example, the French
mathematician Dieudonné [7] famously argued the other side—that mathematics was more like a
game of chess in which there is no absolute truth because the rules are arbitrary. In relative realism
we do take the ‘mathematics is out there’ view but we also take the Dieudonné view except that we
do not see it as perjorative. Thus, there is a reality experienced by chess players as they experience
the restrictions of chess while playing, in some sense ‘created’ or carved out by those restrictions,
but at the same time the rules of chess are not arbitrary and constitute an ‘empirical fact’ although
at a higher level as an element of the reality, of possible board games as experienced by designers
of board games [1]. This gives a hierarchical ‘room within rooms’ structure to our experience of
reality a little different from Hilbert’s analogy. Exiting a room by dropping an axiom takes us into
a bigger room in which the door we just came out of is just one of the points of interest [8].
