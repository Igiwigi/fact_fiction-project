This theory would suggest that the minimum potential required to produce a spark
conversely might be used as a means of determining the energy to produce an ion. The phenomenon, however, is more complex than this would indicate. The minimum
sparking potential is to a small extent influenced by the metal used for the electrodes
and also by the gas, and moreover it would leave unexplained the remarkable fact
that when the electrodes are a small distance apart the spark does not follow the
shortest path (/oc. cit.) between them.
