The present paper only deals with the establishment of the truth of the linkages
effect. The majority of the linkages observed are represented in sixteen maps. This
method is in fact the only way in which the general connection can be visualised and
realised. They are based on the differences as found and consequently must contain
a considerable number of chance coincidences, although for the reason given above
(p. 863) the number will be less than that given by the probability formula. In the
present state of our knowledge there is little to decide where they occur.
