and this is the temperature of explosion reckoned from absolute zero. Subtracting 274
from this temperature to reduce the scale to Centigrade, we have temperature of explo-
gion =2231* C,

If we asume 4=*65, the temperature of explosion deduced in the same way would be
1950” C.; but this temperature, as we shall shortly show, would be somewhat too low,

We have now three points to consider ;—

1. Is this temperature a probable one? and can any direct experimental facts be
adduced to corroborate this theoretical deduction 2

2. What is the mean specific heat of the 8olid or liquid products which the above
temperature implies? and bvy

3. Can any corroboration be given to the high rate of expansion of the solid residue
implied by assuming the value of « as =*6?

With regard to the direct estimation of the temperature of explosion, we have made
several experiments with the view of obtaining this result, by ascertaining the effects of
the heat developed on platinum. For example, in experiment 78 we introduced into the
charge of R. F. G. a coil of yery fine platinum wire and als a piece of thin sheet plati-
