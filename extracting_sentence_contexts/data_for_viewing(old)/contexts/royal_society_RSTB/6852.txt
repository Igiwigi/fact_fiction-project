bearing on the probability of future eruptions. Perret has expressed the opinion that
dome-building marks a late decadent stage in the evolution of a volcano such as

* Sapper, followed by von Wolff, has erroneously recorded subsequent eruptions at the Soufriére
of St Vincent between 21 and 30 May 1903 (Sapper 1927; von Wolff 1929). The time of this activity

was between 21 and 30 March 1903 (Anderson and Flett 1908, p. 293). May was a critical time at
Lassen Peak, the main outbursts occurring in that month in 1914, 1915 and 1917.

Mt Pelé, characterized by acidic lava, and that this fact is valuable in volcanological
diagnosis and prediction (Perret 1935, p. 106). Some other volcanologists hold
similar views. The duration of such a “late stage’’, although short from a geological
point of view, may of course be protracted when regarded from the human standpoint.
Thus we know that at Mt Pelé the explosive dome-building of 1902 was renewed in
1929; and there is no guarantee that it will not recur.

Castles Peak is a peléan dome in the crater of a volcano which, apart from soufriére
activity on its flanks, has been long inactive. It would thus appear, from Perret’s
hypothesis, that the danger of recrudescence of violent explosive activity in Mont-
serrat is small. Although I believe this is most probably the case, it must be pointed
out that absolute reliance cannot be placed on Perret’s generalization. It is known
to be true for several volcanoes of peléan type, but according to Williams, who has
