Offshore wind farms are remotely located and operate under challenging conditions, much worse ;
than the onshore wind farms. Early failure of their components has been frequently observed â€˜a
in the past. This fact could inhibit their establishment as an attractive alternative option for 1
power generation. It is for this reason that the development of a reliable structural health
monitoring (SHM) and condition monitoring (CM) strategy is particularly necessary and why
current research is focusing on this aim.

In order to perform a health monitoring strategy, one of the initial steps is to acquire the
appropriate data for the purpose of damage detection. For an online approach, which is probably
more appropriate when dealing with remote structures, vibration-based monitoring has been Lo
proven to be a suitable choice. It can be effective with possibly small computational costs :
when using suitable methods. There have been several successful SHM and CM vibration- =
based analysis applications in the past. Generally, one could adopt data-based approaches or 3
physics-based approaches, both having certain advantages and drawbacks [1]. Concerning the {8
data-based methods that will be discussed here, the major issue seems to be that for some :
