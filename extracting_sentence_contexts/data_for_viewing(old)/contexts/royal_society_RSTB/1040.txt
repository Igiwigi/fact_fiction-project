its dorsal border backwards towards its ventral border. In other words, just as on the
lower trunk the ventral extremity of the skin field of the root lies somewhat further
from the head end of the body than does the dorsal extremity of the field, so here.
_ And one has seen that the same slant obtains in other root-fields already examined in
the limb; but there is a difference between the application of it in the preceding skin
fields (¢.g., of lumbar IV) and here, because with them the ventral extremity of the
field, lying further removed from the head than the dorsal extremity of the field, lay

& further down the limb than the dorsal extremity; here, with the VIth lumbar root
a field, the ventral extremity of the field, because it lies further removed from the head
© than the dorsal extremity, lies higher up, @.¢., less distal, in the limb than the dorsal

Z. extremity. This is the fuller expression of ia fact that was already indicated by the

& distribution of the Vth lumbar field, viz., that in the limb the essentially zonal root-

2 fields sloping down from mid-dorsal line to mid-ventral line, are now beginning to return
F from the apical portion of the limb to the proximal. The return procession of the root-

® fields from the apex of the limb to the trunk, commences with the VIth lumbar skin-
20 field, just as the outward procession of the root-fields from the trunk to the limb apex

4 commences with the Ist lumbar field. And the distortion of the root-field by the
