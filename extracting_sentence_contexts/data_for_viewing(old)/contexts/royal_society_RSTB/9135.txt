NMDARs would also make sense regarding the interaction
of NMDARs with their intracellular partners. Indeed, the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of GluN2 subunits dictates the
scaffolding protein the receptor can interact with and, thus,
strongly influences the surface localization of NMDAR
subtypes (as reviewed in great detail in [8,9]). It was pro-
posed that GluN2A-NMDARs associate preferentially with
PSD95, which is believed to limit their field of action to the
PSD and increase their half-life time before recycling
[38,43-47]. Because they tend to interact with SAP102
rather than with PSD95, GluN2B-NMDARs are thought to
be more mobile, widespread and not confined to synapses
in adults [45,47]. In fact, the expression of GluN2A and
GluN2B subunits closely follows the expression of PSD95
and SAP102, respectively, during development [47], and evi-
