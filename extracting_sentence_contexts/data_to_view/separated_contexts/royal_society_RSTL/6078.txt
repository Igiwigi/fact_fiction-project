AroxnoLy. A $hort part of the memoir relates to the binary cubic and the binary quartic, viz. each
of these quantics has a covariant of its own order, forming with it an intermediate
zU+PW, the covariants whereof contain quantics in (&, 3), the coefficients of which are
invariants of the original quantic. The formulz which relate to these cases are in fact
given in my Fifth Memoir, but they are reproduced here in order to show the relations
between the quantics in (&, 3) contained in the formule. As regards the binary quartic,
these results are required for the discussion of the like question in regard to the ternary
cubic, viz. that of finding the relations between the different quantics in (Â«, 8) contained
in the formule relating to the ternary cubic. Some of these relations have been
obtained by M.
