As we hall hereafter see, the "Inimber ant shape of the
carpal and tarsal bones of all animals belonging to the Paridigitate series present an
extreme uniformity, individually as well as in their relation to one another and to
the metacarpal and metatarsal bones; and this similarity is indeed 80 great that we
cannot explain it in any other way than by community of descent. The extreme con
stancy in the relations of these bones in all Paridigitata being ascertained, the problem
which is unayoidably presented to the mind of the obseryer may be stated thus :â€”Very
irregular small bones, intended to constitute a movable articulation between the long
bones of the extremity and the metatarsals and metacarpals, arranged themselves in a
certain way in reference to one another and to these metacarpals and metatarsals;
this arrangement remains the same in all Paridigitata, recent as well as fossl,
notwithstanding the greatest diversity of form, size, and habits of life; and if some
slight change is to be seen, it is due clearly to the overdevelopment of certain digits
and consequent reduction of others ; but in all cases the reason of change is at once
apparent: how can such similarity in animals 8 entirely different be explained? To
all naturalists who accept the gradual descent and differentiation of all Paridigitata
from one common form, the fact must, appear as a perfectly reasonable and intelligible
one. If the immediate progenitor of the Paridigitates presented the given arrangement
of the carpal and tarsal bones, then, at the gradual differentiation of this type, every
small change in one bone called forth a corresponding change in all its neighbours. And
as the link which connects all the forms together was never destroyed, and the changes
were slowly going on, we meet now, in the extremely differentiated descendants, a unity
of organization which was inevitable if all these forms descended from one common
progenitor.
