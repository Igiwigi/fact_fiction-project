In each case, with the increase of N the stability zone shifts towards the right and
becomes generally wider for a given appropriate value of Ip. Furthermore, the curve which
delimits the stability region on the left exhibits a corner-like point—i.e. a not regular point—for
values of N <7 as is shown in the figure for the case N = 3. This is due to the fact that one should
satisfy the conditions (1) and (2) of corollary 7.2. In figure 10, we show in much greater detail the behaviour of the eigenvalues of the two blocks
of the Hessian: the completely diagonalized one and the one coming from the matrix G2. We have
indicated in magenta, blue, green and red the regions where G? has, respectively, two, four, six and
eight positive eigenvalues.
