rises above these limits, the relative probable error undergoes a sudden drop, and with
a single exception does not rise above ‘058. Now larve developed under natura
conditions probably rarely, if ever, would have a mean body length less than 32°7¢
for in these artificially developed larvae, with one or two exceptions, the body lengt
only fell beneath this limit when fertilisations were performed in the summer mont
with not thoroughly mature ova. There seems, therefore, to be a considerable |
hood that the probable error is increased when larve are artificially developed ut ;
conditions which do not obtain, except perhaps in rare cases, in a state of nee

this supposition is correct is borne out by the fact that the relative probable
rror of the smallest larvee, which developed under the most unnatural conditions, is
reater than that for the medium sized larve.
___ As the larvee were only measured in sets of fifties, it is not possible to determine
the probable error in each set; but in order to get some idea as to the variability under
erent conditions of environment, the following method was adopted. The average
obable error in each set of measurements was determined by multiplying the mean
body length by ‘061, i.e., the mean relative probable error of all the groups of larvee.
+ The number of larvze in each set of fifty was then counted, of which the body length
© was outside the limits of mean body length + probable error. If the variability is
Bexactly average, this number would be 25; if it is greater than the average, the
‘number would be larger, and if smaller, smaller. In the last column of the table at
a.the end of the paper, are given the numbers indicating the “ variability” in the size
