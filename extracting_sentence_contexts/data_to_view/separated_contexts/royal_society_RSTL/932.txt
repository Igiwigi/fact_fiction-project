When preserved some time in that state, a longitudinal sec-
tion of one of the corpora cavernosa was made, as in Plate
XX, and the quicksilver allowed to run out. The prepa-
ration thus made is in the Collection of the Royal College
of Surgeons in London ; one of the many valuable donations
made to that Museum by Sir WiLL1am BLizard, The others
were made upon this occasion. From these preparations, the fact is sufficiently established,
that the cellular internal structure of the corpora cavernosa
and corpus sponglosum, receives the blood into its cavities
directly from the smaller branches of the arteries with which
these parts are provided; but the nature of this structure
remains to be explained. It was found-by Mr. Baves, from an examination of these
different preparations, that the cellular structure of the cor-
pora cavernosa is made up of an infinite number of thin
membranous plates, exceedingly elastic, s0 connected to-
gether as to form a kind of trellis work, the edge of which
is firmly connected with the strong elastic ligamentous sub-
stance by which these bodies are surrounded, and which forms
a s8eptum between them, separating them from one another. This substance has an intermixture of muscular fibres.
