where we have also used the assumptions of uniform convergence of the series of the derivatives. Recall that T(t, x) = (e'40T )(x), see (1.4); from the previous facts we have

The mild formulation of this identity, furthermore applied in a weak sense to a smooth test
function ¢ with compact support in D, is

where (.,-) is the inner product in L?(D) and we have also used the fact that the semigroup e('-5)4o

is self-adjoint. By the isometry formula for Ité integrals,
