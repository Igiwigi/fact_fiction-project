Thus, NC is often explored as reinforcement for
polymers [1,18-20]. The application of NC as reinforcement for polymers often requires the NC
to be used in the form of single nanofibrils. In fact, it has been shown that the reinforcement
efficiency can be explored effectively when NC is impregnated at a single fibre level [1]. However,
it is difficult to exploit the properties of single CNFs fully in composites. Thus, in order to
produce NC composites with promising and predictable mechanical properties, high-loading
fractions have to be realized [1].
