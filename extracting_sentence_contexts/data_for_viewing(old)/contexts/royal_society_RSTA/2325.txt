(i) Detecting disagreement is an inference problem

The most important aspect of adjoint valuation algebras is that, given a globally agreeing
knowledgebase, if a truth valuation exists, then it can be obtained by simply combining all
the available information. This is the content of the following proposition, which generalizes
proposition 2.3 in [4].

Proposition 5.2 (see appendix A for the proof). Let ® be an adjoint valuation algebra on a set
of variables V. Let K = {$1,...,¢n} G® be a knowledgebase. Let y = @/'_, $j. Then $1,...,¢n agree
globally if and only if y 4) = ;. In this case, y is the most informative of all the possible truth valuations.

Thanks to this proposition, the quest for a global truth valuation becomes a much easier task.
This, in turn, makes the problem of detecting disagreement significantly simpler. In fact, we can
reformulate it as an inference problem. Given a knowledgebase {¢1,...,@n}, it is sufficient to solve
the problem

for all 1<i<n. Then, the knowledgebase agrees globally if and only if the solution to each
problem is ¢;.

(c) Complete disagreement

Let $1, ¢2 € ® be two valuations of an adjoint information algebra ®, and let d(¢) = S, d(¢2) =T,
with SN T 4. By proposition 5.2, to say that ¢; and ¢2 disagree amounts to say that not all the
