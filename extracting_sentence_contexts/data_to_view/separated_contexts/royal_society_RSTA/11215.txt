R. FORSYTH ON THE INTEGRATION OF

In the first section (§ 2), a generalisation of Ampére’s method was dealt with very
briefly, partly because that method and Darsovux’s method apply most effectively
to equations in which (with few exceptions) the derivatives of the highest order
occur linearly ; and, of the two, it is DarBoux’s method which can be more effectively
applied to other equations. The fact that the characteristic invariant was resoluble
proved of material importance in the general theory. It is to be remarked, however, that some of the equations which occur most
frequently in mathematical physics, for example

Ov Ov Cv =

aa + ae + 38 = %
Ov ; Ov Ov = Ov
Or Op Ov 5 Ov
aa Ta ce es

the latter two being, for purposes of application, made to depend upon the equation

Op Ov Ov 9
3 — KD,

aut " Oy * ae

belong to the class which have their characteristic invariant not resvluble, and at the
same time are linear in the derivatives of the highest orders that occur. Accordingly
both Ampére’s method and Darsoux’s method generalised can be applied to such
equations.
