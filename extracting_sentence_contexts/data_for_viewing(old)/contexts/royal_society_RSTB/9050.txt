any embryonic lineage. Accordingly, it would be of great
interest to capture and propagate cells in such a state of
formative pluripotency.

More than 600 proteins have been implicated in exit from the
naive state. Here, we have discussed only a handful, primarily,
of those whose function has been independently validated.
However, this limited set is sufficient to reveal the variety of
the mechanisms that control early state transitions in ESCs
and complexity of the regulation. Investigation of further can-
didates will expand our understanding in this area and may
facilitate efforts in deriving naive ESCs from non-rodent
species, including humans. The fact that these actors are
revealed upon 2i withdrawal but are mostly present in the
naive state suggests that ESCs cultured in LIF/serum are
likely to be continuously challenged owing to active MEK/
ERK and GSK3 signalling induced by undefined serum
components in addition to autocrine Fgf4. In this light, the
widely commented upon heterogeneity of ESCs in LS appears
to be a response to an incoherent signalling context, in which
the naive pluripotency circuitry is constantly confronted with
differentiation stimuli. We contend that the defined 2i/LIF cul-
ture system for ESCs provides a more appropriate and accurate
reflection of naive epiblast in the embryo. ESC differentiation
after 2i/LIF withdrawal mimics orderly transitions of the
