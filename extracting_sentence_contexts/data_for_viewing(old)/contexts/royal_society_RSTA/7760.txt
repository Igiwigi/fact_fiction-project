constant in (11) has been adjusted in each case to make the values fit the observa-
tions at the equinoxes. In fig. 10 are shown the corresponding curves for Regions
E and F, at Slough.

Tt will be seen that in both figs. 9 and 10 there is substantial agreement between
the observed seasonal variations of /;,° and f;,° and the theoretical curves strongly
supporting the view that the ionization at noon varies with the solar altitude as
expected according to an ultra-violet light theory ofits origin. It is noteworthy that,
at the season when the sun just failed to rise at Troms6, no Region E or Region F,
echoes were obtained, but that, at midwinter, echoes from about the height of
Region E reappeared, although there was no corresponding reappearance of
Region F, echoes. It will be noticed that the measurements of fp,° at Troms6 are
comparatively few, partly owing to the fact that its occurrence there is indicated by
a very ill-defined maximum on the (P’, f) curve and partly due to the possibility of
its being missed altogether in one of the 0-25 Mc./sec. steps in which the frequency
range of observations was covered. However, the little evidence we have supports
the view that this region behaves at Tromsé as could be predicted from its behaviour
at Slough according to the ultra-violet light theory.

The corresponding results for Region F,, the main upper region, are shown in
figs. 11 and 12. Here it will be seen that there is no pronounced seasonal variation,
the summer values being, if anything, slightly less than the winter values at Slough.
The rapid decrease of critical frequency over the week preceding midwinter and the
corresponding increase just after this date at Tromsé appears to be more than
fortuitous. It is also significant that the highest sequence of critical frequencies
