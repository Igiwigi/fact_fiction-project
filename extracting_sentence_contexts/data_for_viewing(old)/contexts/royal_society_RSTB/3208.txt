of the crypts. On the contrary, they are attached in most cases to the feetal villi,
though in other places they lie in the shrinkage space between the villi and the
crypts. Probably these latter have been torn off from the villi during the previous
manipulation which the specimen has undergone. The whole of the crypts beneath
the surface are lined by an even layer of cubical cells, which possess nuclei of rounded
form and are very constant in size and appearance.

This layer of cells which clings to the walls of the crypts does not seem in any part
to be fused with it, as do the cells which are always found at the fundus of each
crypt in the sheep, for it shows in many places a tendency to be split off very much
like a normal epithelium would split off (fig. 34, Plate 11).

In fact, I feel confident that here is a layer which is not represented as such in

* SeLENKA (86) describes binucleate cells in the villus of Tragulus. Except for the presence of the
binucleate cells, his account agrees more closely with KorsrEnâ€™s, of the horse, than with mine, of the sheep.
