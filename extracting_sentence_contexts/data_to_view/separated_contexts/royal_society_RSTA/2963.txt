The relationship between potential gradient and rain electricity will now be
considered. ‘The potential gradient record did not commence until July 18, and
owing to spiders spinning their webs from the collector to the surrounding objects
a good many days’ records were lost. In spite of these facts many data were
collected, and can be used to show the relationship between the signs of the electricity
of the rain and the potential gradient. Defining the sign of the fine weather potential
gradient as positive, it may be taken as a general rule that negative potential gradient
only occurs during periods of disturbed weather. It is a well-known fact that during
thunderstorms the potential gradient undergoes violent and rapid changes, and these
changes must in some way be associated with the same electrical effect that causes the
thunder and lightning.
