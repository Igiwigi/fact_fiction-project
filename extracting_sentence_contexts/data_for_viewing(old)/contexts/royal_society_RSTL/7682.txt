by (2); or a contact of the second order, the condition will be denoted by (3), and 80 on.
It is to be observed that the conditions (2), (3), &c. are sibireciprocal, the contact at a
given point of the curve is the same thing as contact with a given tangent of the curve ;
but if we write (1) to denote the condition of passing through a given point of the
curve, this is not the same thing as the condition of touching a given tangent of the
curve; and this last condition, if it were necessary to deal with it, might be denoted by (1).
But I attend only to the condition (T). The expressions for the number of conics which
satisfy such conditions as (1), (2), &c. are obtainable in several ways.

63. (1*) When the total number of conditions is 4, the question may be solved by
ZEUTHEN'S method, viz. by determining the line-pairs and point-pairs of the system 4Z,
with the proper numerical coefficients, and thence deducing the values of the character-
istics (4Z - ) and (4Z/). A few cases are in fact thus solved in Zxurux's work.

64. (2%) By the foregoing functional method. Tt is to be observed that there is a
difference in the form of the functional equation, and th

l : at the general solution is always
given in the form, Particular Solution + Constant, 80 that there is only a single con-

stant to be determined by special considerations. 'To take the simplest example, let it
be required to find the number of the conics (3Z) (1, 1): writing for shortness in place
hereof (1, 1), or (in order to mark the curve (1) to which the symbol has reference)
(1, 1),z let the curve (m) be the aggregate of the curyes (1) and (1m). Regarding the
point 1 as a given point on the curve (m), that is, an arbitrary point in regard to the
