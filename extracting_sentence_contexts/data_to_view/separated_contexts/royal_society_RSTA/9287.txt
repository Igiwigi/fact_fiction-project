It must be remembered, however, that this transformation has been constructed
solely with a view to the angular configuration, and that it affords no guarantee that
the stream-lines corresponding respectively to w > c¢ and w <—c will not be merely
parallel instead of being in the same straight line. There is, in fact, the possibility of a configuration of the character indicated in
fig. 4, and it must now be shown that this possibility can be provided against by a
suitable adjustment of the parameter /.

16. Significance of the Early Terms in the Expansion of w for Great Values
of z.—If in a transformation such as that of formula (29) the variable w be supposed
to have its modulus large, and an expansion be made in ascending negative powers
of w, the result is a formula of the type

dz = V- {1+Sw3+VDw-"} dw, 2... 2 ees (80)

where negative powers of w beyond the second are neglected, and 8 and D are
constants. Omitting in the first instance the term in w~’, it is seen that the first approxi-

mation to z is V~w, and that to the next degree of approximation the formula is

equivalent to
dw = (V—Sz") dz,

In this expression for w the first term represents uniform flow V in the negative
direction of the real axis, and the second term represents a source of strength 8 at
the origin.
