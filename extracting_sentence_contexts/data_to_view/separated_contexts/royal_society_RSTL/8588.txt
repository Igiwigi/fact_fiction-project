In pocks which
S have been cut out two to three days after their appearance, the rete Malpighii is seen
© to be many times thicker than in the normal parts, and thickest in the centre. The
zZ cells of the deeper and middle strata are enlarged and sharply outlined. Many of them
S are in the condition of multiplication, as may be deduced from the fact that they possess
g two nuclei, and that, particularly in the deepest layer, the nuclei are much closer to
& eachother, 7.6, more numerous. In the flattened cells of the more superficial strata there
SZ lie close to the poles of the oblong nucleus highly refractive granules, which are largest
s and most numerous in the most superficial cells, and become smaller and scarcer in the
£ deeper strata; at the same time the nuclei of many cells of the superficial strata look
S as if they were yacuolated, viz. sharply outlined with perfectly clear contents.
