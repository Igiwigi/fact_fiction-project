% Other simple equations can be constructed which are amenable to this type of analysis,
= and it is often possible to obtain an idea of the behaviour of more complicated equations
g by analogy with one of these cases. The integral equation (56) has a kernel which is negative
everywhere, with a modulus which steadily decreases. It can therefore be compared with
& (76), with both A and yz negative, giving no error build-up. Even if the sign of the kernel
S were changed, giving a positive A, the decrease in modulus is so rapid that there is still no
substantial error accumulation.

© Another approach to error analysis, for a kernel of the form k(x—y), is provided by the
Laplace transformation. The previous analysis is qualitative, in the sense that it examines
the behaviour of the complementary function, introduced by a single rounding error. In
fact, such a rounding error is made at every point, and it is more accurate to take for the
total error propagation the solution of the integral equation obtained from (4) by replacing
g(x) by a step-function s(x), for which $>5(x) > —4 for all x. The solution of this equation
is given formally by 1 prtie ef (s)

S (x) eg ~ Oni Ai 1—L(k) dp,

(77)

which is equation (68) with g replaced by s.
