These facts, although probably widely known, do not seem to have been appreciated
in their relation to the question of the development of the vessels, inasmuch as it is
improbable that an artery running ventral to the vein and nerve, as does the subclavian
in Birds, can correspond in origin with a trunk which, asin Mammals, crosses dorsal to
these two structures. Only two observers, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
have taken notice of the different positions of the vessels. One of these, SABATIER,*
has been led to propose a scheme of development differing in some respects from that
of RaruxKe, while the other, BRENNER,t in a paper on vascular abnormalities, merely
notices the facts, and expresses a doubt as to the correctness of the accepted beliefs.

The intercostal arteries are directed chiefly from the aorta, but the first two or three
spring from the vertebral.

Vestigial structwres.—The right and left pulmonary arteries are each connected to
the descending aorta by a ductus arteriosus round which the pneumogastric nerve
sends it recurrent branch. These may be looked upon as completing the pulmonary
arches. The left ductus arteriosus, passing dorsal to the root of the lung, is a long
ligamentous cord which unites with the aorta usually opposite the sixth dorsal vertebra.
The right one is described as a short structure passing into the posterior border of the
arched portion of the aorta, but I have always found it, in my dissections, of con-
siderable length, terminating in the descending aorta about half the breadth of a
