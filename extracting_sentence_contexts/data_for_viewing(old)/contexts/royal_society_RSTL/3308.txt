Section IV.â€”Proofs from organic remains of a change of level between the land and
the ea in Scotland. The effects of elevation traced in hypothesis.

Another question immediately arises ; did the waters of the sea lowly subside, or
the land slowly rise, the effect in each case being similar? But first it will be proper
to show, from the more ordinary kind of evidence, that there has been some change
of level between land and water affecting Scotland within recent times, although not
to the amount inferred from the arguments above adyanced. Mr. Smith of Jordan-
Hill, in an excellent paper*, has lately shown from the presence of elevated organic re-
mains, that within a period geologically extremely recent, both the east and west coast
of Scotland has been raised some hundred feet; namely, at Banff and near Glasgow+
about 350 feet. Considering the facts given in this paper, it can scarcely be doubted,
without making the most improbable assumptions, that the Great Glen of Scotland,
of which the highest point is only ninety-three feet above the sea, was within this
recent period an open strait ; and, I may add, it must then have strikingly resembled
the Beagle Channel in Tierra del Fuego, an arm of the sea narrower, longer, and
straighter, which intersects the extreme southern part of South America. In ac-
