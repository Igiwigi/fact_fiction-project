The distribution of wind selected for this test is likely to show up some of the errors in an
extreme degree.

The calm is assumed to extend from the ground to a naturalized height of C. The
velocity in the wind layer is taken to be independent of height. The sphere is assumed
to penetrate the wind to a naturalized height of Z = 0-2 above the interface. The
problem is then to find the balancing tilt and the wind-speed. The solution consists of
two parts ; one in the wind, one in the calm. They have to be fitted together at the
interface.

The Motion in the Wind.—Because the wind is independent of height we can reduce
it to a calm by giving a suitable translational velocity to our axes of reference. The
trajectory in this fictitious calm is then far from vertical, so that it is necessary to obtain
the required integrals of the dynamical equations, without neglecting any terms. This
is impossible without quadratures. There are, however, some analytic partway stages.
The more useful of these, taken from Cranz and Brcxer* § 20, and translated into
present notation, read as follows :—Let Ry be the value of the naturalized speed relative
to air at the vertex. Then
