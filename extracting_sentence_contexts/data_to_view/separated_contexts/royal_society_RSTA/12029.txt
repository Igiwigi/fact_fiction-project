The heating current was adjusted, by means of R,, so
that, after both rings had been brought to the same temperature, the two temperatures
remained equal while both rose. The thermo-electric junctions were connected to
oppose each other through a sensitive galvanometer, but an alternative connection
could be made in which one junction only acted on the galvanometer, so that the
temperature of the ring might be estimated at any stage in the experiment. It was
necessary, in fact, to record the temperature of the ring from time to time, to allow
for change in the resistance of the iron wire forming its core. The following will serve as an example of the readings taken. It refers to an expe-
riment upon a pair of precisely similar rings, one of which was the Ring VII. of the
tests already described.
