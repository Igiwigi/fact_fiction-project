It has been noticed that when solutions are photographed with a Leyden-jar in
circuit, and when these s0lutions are concentrated, two very fine and continuous lines of
a strong character, which have been identified with the metal calcium, are occasionally
geen, Their wave-lengths are 3967'6 and 3933, and they are designated H and K of
the solar spectrum on M. Cornvu's map. Sometimes a second pair of lines, with wave-
lengths 37365 and 3705'5, are visible. They appear in strong solations of cadmium
chloride, ferric chloride, cobaltic chloride, and ferric nitrate. They are of very feeble
intensity in strontium chloride and barium chloride, and then only the first pair are
visible, attenuated and shortened.

They appear as short lines and rather feeble in photographs taken from electrodes
of Stexexs-MARTIN steel, and from electrodes of iridium. The most remarkable fact
about these lines is, that they are nob visible in the spectra of the alkaline chlorides,
lithium, sodium and potassinum, which were prepared from neutral solutions. Nor are
they to be een in the spectram of aluminium chloride. They do nob appear in photo-
graphs of the spectra of graphite points, either when dry or moistened with water, but
? they are 8een as very faint and short lines when graphite points are moistened with
hydrochloric acid. They are fairly well seen in s0lutions of ferric sulphate, prepared
by dissolving the oxide in sulphuric acid. For some time the origin of these lines
was a 8ource of some perplexity, for although they had been ascertained to be calcium
lines, yet they made their appearance on occasions when they were least expected, and
when their presence could not be accounted for. Acids were always found to contain
traces of calcium, and particularly hydrochloric acid ; but the quantity was 80
minute as to be capable of detection only by photographing the spectram. A quantity
