(a) Properties of virus-interacting proteins

We use a dataset of approximately 4500 VIPs that are human
proteins known to interact physically with viruses (electronic
supplementary material, table S1). Of these, we previously
manually curated 1920 from the virology literature (see

adaptation, with a strong likelihood of functional mutations
affecting the viral replication cycle. The remaining approxi-
mately 2600 VIPs were identified using high-throughput
methods and were retrieved from the VirHostnet 2.0 database
as well as from a number of additional studies (electronic sup-
plementary material, table S1). For this analysis, we pooled the
