To the rest of Dr. AusTiN's experiments either
one or both of the/above objections are applicable. The first and most important step, therefore, in the repetition


carbonated hydrogenous Gas. 405

of these experiments, is to determine, whether the carbonated
hydrogenous gas really sustains, by the process of electrization,
a diminution of its quantity of carbon ; because, should this be
decided in the negative, we derive from the fact a very useful
direction in ascertaining the true source of the evolved hydro-
gen. Â» The following experiments were therefore made with
a view to decide this question, and the error of Dr. AusTiN, in
employing too little oxygen, was carefully avoided. *
