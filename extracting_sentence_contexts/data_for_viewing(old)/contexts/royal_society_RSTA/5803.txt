the risks it might see as a company (cyberattack, industrial accident, equipment failure) but also
more broad-ranging or unusual risks that other actors have greater knowledge of and expertise
to manage, but that could affect some aspects of energy production, delivery or safety.

The UK-based Centre for Long-Term Resilience has recently released a report [13] suggesting
steps towards resilience in the energy sector, which include improving the ability to identify
threats and vulnerabilities by producing standards and guidelines for risk assessment and
response. Assessments and planning should be regularly tested through a network of resiliency
test platforms for collaborative learning and development.

8. Obstacles to resilience: biased risk perceptions

Some risks might be fairly accurately assessed and factually communicated yet still be variably
(and often inaccurately) perceived by the range of different stakeholders receiving the messages.
A particular concern is the perception of risk by those who are charged with managing the risks
