Resulting Coefficient of resistance =0:00000 02723. : The coefficient of resistance, 80 determined for each range, has no sensible variation,”
thus proving that the facts are exactly met by the law that the resistance varies accord-
ing to the cube of the velocity, with a coefficient of resistance, for this particular bullet,”
of 0:00000 02723. This is subject to the assumptions previously mentioned. It is
further either involved or assumed that the bullet presents an invariable aspect in a
horizontal direction.
