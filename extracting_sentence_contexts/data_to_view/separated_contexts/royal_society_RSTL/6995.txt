Wherever these nuclei are 8ituated new muscular tiswe may be produced,
Jud it is only in these situations that muscular tissue ever is produced ; s0 that by the
TDPosition of the nuclei we learn the seat of formation of new muscle at different periods
Sf life. X The facts which I regard as favourable to the view above expressed concerning the
ovements of the masses of germinal matter of muscle, are derived from many sources,
but I will refer to some observed in the case of the muscles of the papillze of the tongue. Here the muscular fibre is very thin and delicate, and yery fayourable for observation. The mass of germinal matter is very much wider than the muscle.
