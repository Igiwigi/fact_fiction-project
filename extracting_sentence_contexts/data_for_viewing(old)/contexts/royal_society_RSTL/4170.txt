the direction in which the luminous arc has been projected.

When, instead of a plate and a point, two points are used for electrodes, it is evident
that no visible trace of this phenomenon can be obtained ; but both the sharp hissing
and the detonations may be produced, which latter are sometimes 80 loud as to bear a
resemblance to distant discharges of musketry. For this the electro-magnet must be
very powerful, and the current which produces the arc very intense. I had obseryed
that when I took for a positive electrode a point of platinum, and for a negative elec-
trode a point of copper, and placed them between the two poles of the electro-magnet,
the production of the voltaic arc between the two poles was accompanied by a sharp
hissing noise; whereas in the opposite case, the copper being positive, and the pla-
tinum negative, the detonations were heard, attended by a frequent breaking of the
arc. On examining this phenomenon more closely, I perceived that the fact I have
just mentioned was due to the platinum becoming heated much more rapidly than
the copper when they were employed as electrodes in producing the voltaic arc ; and

T have satisfied myself that in order to obtain the hissing sounds, it is necessary that
the positive electrode should be at a sufficiently high temperature to experience a com-
mencement of liquefaction ; for without this condition, only a series of detonations
are heard. The hissing would be the result of the easy and continuous transport of
matter more or less liquefied from the positive electrode, whilst the detonations would
be the effect of the resistance opposed by the same matter to the disintegration of its
