8. Classification and Selection Rules.

The form of the spin-energies given by (7.31) for large Z suggests that the three
terms I, I, II, have (ordinary) j’s respectively equal to k +1, k, k—1. In this
section we verify that the weights of the terms are 2k + 3, 2k 4-1, 2k—1, in
accordance with the usual formula 2j 4-1; and also that the selection rules Ak = + 1,
Aj = + 1, 0, are valid to a first approximation.

The weights are governed by the fact that for certain values of w the four wave-
functions in the group (4.10) reduce to three or one. In the preceding sections
we have tacitly assumed that # = 1, |u| <k. If, however,

and the other three wave-functions of the group do not exist. The spin energy is

evidently
by (4.20), (5.34), (5.40). (The factor k — u +1 belongs toa 0! The factor (k — u)!
we have only

must be omitted from T, U, C in (8.02).)
