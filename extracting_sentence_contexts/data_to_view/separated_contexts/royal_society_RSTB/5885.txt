4a, 5a) for Taxus
and Torreya would agree with this idea, and the recurved position of the podocarp
ovules may well be a primitive feature. Professor SewaRD has drawn my attention
to the question of the epimatium of the Taxaces. The nature of this envelope has
always seemed very problematical, but it can certainly be compared with the cupules
of the Corystospermaceze in its position, in the facts that it often becomes fleshy, and
that, unlike the testa, its outer epidermis possesses numerous stomata. The early origin
of the cone habit in the Abietines and Araucarinez may be correlated with the evolution
in these groups of ovuliferous structures which seem very remote from what is here
regarded as a primitive inflorescence, but Wauronâ€™s (1928) recent discovery of a bract
scale, together with the form of the ovuliferous scale in Voltzia, renders the suggested
connection more probable. It would seem, then, that the new female inflorescences now
described are not so incompatible with the ovuliferous structures of the Gymnosperms
as they might at first appear.
