We do not dispute the
fact that fire causes a range of ecological and environmental
changes—some of which are less welcome than others and
have a mixture of costs and benefits. There is, however, very
considerable uncertainty, and knowledge is missing in several
key areas. Ongoing research in the UK is certainly not being
helped by the fact that several studies seem to be operating
in a vacuum where understanding from wildland fire science
and peatland ecology more generally is missing and leading
to methodological and interpretational errors. In particular
here is the argument from wildland fire scientists in the USA
(e.g. [150,151]) and Mediterranean (e.g. [152,153]) that fire
exclusion (or the ‘over-suppression paradigm’) allows fuels to
accumulate and ultimately increases fire intensity and burn
severity. This hypothesis has not yet been tested in the UK con-
text but is often touted as a benefit of managed burning.
