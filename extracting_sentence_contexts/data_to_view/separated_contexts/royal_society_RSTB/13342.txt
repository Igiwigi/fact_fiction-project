that soils and other natural substrates harbour large numbers
of organisms capable of producing antibiotic substances
[242]. In fact, soils are a habitat for numerous autochthonous

are fungi or bacteria belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria,
Proteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas, myxobacteria), Firmicutes
(Bacillus), Bacterioidetes and Cyanobacteria [51,245,246].
