hypothesis would lead us to expect, by the tentative and apparently random motions which
are actually obseryed. Moreover, we must not neglect to notice that these tentative or
random movements resemble in every way the localizing movements, save only in their
want of precision. Again, this hypothesis is rendered yet more probable by the occur-
rence of those gradations in the localizing power of the polypite which we have scen to
be 80 well marked under certain conditions. The occurrence of such gradations under

Q the conditions T have named is what the plexus theory would lead us to expect, becanse
N the closer beneath a section that a stimulus is applied, the greater will be the lateral
E spread of the stimulus through the plexus before it reaches the polypite. Similarly,
= the further the circumferential distance from the nearest end of such a section that the
Â£ stimulus is applied, the greater will be its lateral spread before reaching the polypite.
=) Lastly, the present hypothesis would further lead us to anticipate the fact that when
S Tiaropsis indicans is prepared as represented in fig. 8, the polypite refers a stimulus
5 applied anywhere in the mutilated nectocalyx to the band of tissue by which it is still
=] left in connexion with that organ ; for it is evident that, according to the hypothesis, the
= radial lines occupying such a band are the only ones whose irritation the polypite is able
S to perceive ; and hence it is to be expected that it should tend to refer to these particular
'S lines a source of irritation occurring anywhere in the mutilated bell*.

Z Tt is not quite 80 clear why, in the last-mentioned experiment, the polypite should
& tend to refer a seat of irritation to the unsevered nutrient tube, rather than to the tracts
