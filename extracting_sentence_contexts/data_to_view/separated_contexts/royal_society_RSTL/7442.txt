HuTrox remarks in a note on these con»
clusions:—* These suppositions are not nearly correct. In fact, by more accurate expe-
riments with cannon-balls, it appears that the law of the resistance begins to increase
above the ratio of the square of the velocity, from the very slowest motions, and thene
goes on increasing gradually more and more above what is assigned by that ratio, ti
we arrive at the velocity of 1600 or 1700 feet per second, where it is at the greatest,”
amounting in that maximum state to only 245 times the quantity resulting from the
ratio of the square of the velocity. And at the velocity of 1100 feet, instead of answer-
ing to that law, it amounts to 1-86 times the same.” EvLtr, in the remarks which
accompany his translation of Ropixs' © Gunnery,” states that, the greater the velocity of
the shot, 80 much the more does theory deviate from the truth.
