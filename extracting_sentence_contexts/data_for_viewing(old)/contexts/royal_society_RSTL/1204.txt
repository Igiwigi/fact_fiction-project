Oxarc acid, from the united testimony of EuryarT, HERMB-
8TADT, and WESTRUMB, appears to have been discovered by
SCHEELE ; but it is to BERGMAN that we are indebted for the
first account of its properties. He published his dissertation on
it in 1776, and since that time very little has been added to
the facts contained in his valuable treatise. Chemists have
chiefly directed their attention to the formation of that acid,
and much curious and important information has resulted
from the experiments of HerRMBSTADT, WESTRUMB, BERTHOL-
LET, FouRcRoY, and VAUQUELIN, &c. but the properties of the
acid itself, have been rather neglected. My object in the fol-
lowing pages is not to give a complete history of the proper-
ties of oxalic acid, but merely to state the result of a set of
experiments, undertaken with the view of ascertaining dif-
ferent particulars respecting it, which I conceived to be of
importance.
