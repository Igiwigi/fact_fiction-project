of at least two materials, while in reality all the
patches in it are of the same substance ; oblique light would be even more deceptive
as the slowly-cooled alloy with 2671 atoms (fig. 12) proves. * An examination of the door-panel moulding of the alloy with 33Â°6 atoms almost forces one to the
conclusion that these minute rods or lamin came into existence during the crystallisation, and are not
a later product due to strain or other cause; that they are, in fact, the crystals of which the blob or
polyhedron is built up. This is the view insisted on by Mr. SteaD (loc. cit.). +
