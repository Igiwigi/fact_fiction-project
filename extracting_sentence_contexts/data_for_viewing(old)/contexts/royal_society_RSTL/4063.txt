mottled aspect of columnar epithelium, but seemed to be composed of very minute
globules; in a short time these dissolved away into an amorphous matter. In the
hepatic duet the epithelial particles were very small, about 55th of an inch in dia-
meter; these also disappeared very soon; the general surface was covered by a great
number of globules considerably larger, but of very various size, which closely
resembled the mncous globules in the secretion of the nose or pharynx. A similar
appearance was observed in the hepatic duct of a dog, where after a very short time,
the epithelial particles covering the surface became converted into groups of minute
globules; according to this view, the excretory part of. the duct would have its own
peculiar protecting epithelium, preparing the surface for the passage of the bile
furnished by the secrefory portion+.

From all the facts which have been now related, it may, I think, be concluded,
that the cells forming the margin of the lobule are those in which the elaboration
of the secretion is perfected, and that as this js effected, they burst and discharge

* In cases of this kind the primary cell membrane is often seen to be manifestly altered, appearing =triated
and of a coarser texture.
+ 1 have ascertained subsequently, by examination of perfectly recent specimens, that there is occasionally
a layer of epithelium on the free surface of the bazement membrane, but it is extremely delicate when it exists,
is often absent, and does not appear to be in any way continuous with the secreting epithelium of the lobules. |
