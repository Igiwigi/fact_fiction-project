a high degree of pharmacological activity, the probability that this structure functioned
as an endocrine gland was reviewed. But again, its apparently non-glandular nature threw
doubt on it being the site of formation of any hormones, and the views of Herring (1908)
were accepted by many authorities. Herring suggests that the cells of the pars intermedia
invaded the posterior lobe and became transformed into hyaline bodies (later known as
Herring-bodies) which represented the secretory principle. This material was further
supposed to travel up the pituitary stalk towards the third ventricle, when it was assumed
to act either on the nerve centres of the tuber or invade, through the ependyma, the
ventricular cavity.

In the last ten years the site of formation of the active principles has been shown to be
the neurohypophysis. The evidence on this point is quite conclusive in several forms and
lies in the fact that in the armadillo, manatee, porpoise, whale and Indian elephant, the
buccal hypophysis is separated from the neural by a capsular extension of the meninges,
the only point of contact being a tongue-shaped pars tuberalis which rises above the capsule
and comes into juxtaposition with the median eminence (see Oldham (1938), Dasypus
novemcinctus; Oldham, McCleery & Geiling (1938), Trichechus inunguis; Geiling, Voss &
Oldham (1940), Tursiops truncatus, Prodelphinus pragiodon; Wislocki & Geiling (1936), Physeter
megalocephalus, Balaenoptera physalis, Balaenoptera sibbaldi; and Wislocki (1939), Indian
elephant). In these animals, the hormonal content of the neurohypophysis is qualitatively
the same as in other mammals as regards the vasopressor and oxytocic principles. These
must therefore have been formed in situ, and do not owe their presence to the pars neuralis
forming part of a transit route between the pars intermedia and hypothalamus. The views
