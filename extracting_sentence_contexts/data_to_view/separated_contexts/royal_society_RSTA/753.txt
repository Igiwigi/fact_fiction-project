Comparing again (66) and (67), we find that the latter interval is considerably
shorter than the former. It is easy to see that this is a general rule. In fact, what-
ever the mean, x, if both x, and x, are necessarily positive, then

and it follows from (64) and (65) that
(3/8) 3, (E) <8; (E) < (3/4) 8, (E), ... Â«=... 2 3(69)

showing that the length of the confidence interval determined by (62) and (63) is
always less than 3/4 of that determined by (50) and (51). Itis obvious, therefore, that
the confidence intervals defined by (62) and (63) compared to the other system have
definite advantages. These advantages, however, are independent of the conception
of probability.
