But the balloons can only be followed to great -
heights when the air is clear and the lower winds light. If the lower winds are
strong, the balloon is too far off to be visible long before it has reached the
isothermal region. ;

Qn many occasions there is no great wind up to at least 20 km., so that the
supposed strong westerly winds, if they exist at all, are intermittent, and different
in character to the N.E. and 8.E. trade winds. The fact that from a station in England many quite likely tracks for a balloon end
in the sea introduces a large systematic error, so that no just conclusions can be
drawn from registering balloons in England as to ,the prevalence of certain winds. In most cases the track runs parallel, or nearly so, to the surface isobars, so that
generally the direction of the upper wind does not greatly differ from that of the
lower, and since also very high ascents do not show longer runs than those of average
height, it is certain that the wind velocity decreases rather than increases above 10 or
12 km. But there is nothing in the observational results to negative the supposition
that strong winds may on some occasions exist at a height of 15 km.
