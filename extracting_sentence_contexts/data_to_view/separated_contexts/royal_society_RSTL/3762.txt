when a little saline matter or acid was
added to the water in the steam-globe (2090, &c.), and found that when the water
was in 8uch a state as to have no power of itself, still oil of turpentine, or oil, or resin
in the box C, showed their power, in conjunction with such water, of rendering the

boiler positive, but their power appeared to be reduced : increase of the force of steam,
as in all other cases, would, there is little doubt, have exalted it again. When alkali
was in the steam-globe, oil and resin lost very much of their power, and oil of turpen-
tine very little. This fact will be important hereafter (2126.).

2122. We have seen that the action of such bodies as oil introduced into the jet of
steam changed its power (2108.), but it was only by experiment we could tell whether
this change was to such an extent as to alter the electricity for few or many of the
bodies against which the steam stream rubbed. With olive oil in the box C, al{ the
insulated cones before enumerated (2097.) were made positive.
