The v — displacement shows that all planes »’ = constant have changed into
planes passing through the axis of the cylinder. This is quite a natural thing to
expect. In fact, from a physical point of view it is the simplest change which
can happen to a plate bent into a cylinder. IV—Torsion or A Ricur CrrcuLtar CYLINDER
16—Need for Extension of the Present Theory The necessity of calculating the torsional couple on a circular cylinder to a greater
degree of accuracy than what exists in its present well-known value, ducra’‘, has
been recognized by various authors.
