After that, as our title indicated, we attempted to illustrate, by selected
contributions, the present state of the subject as well as to look ahead at future prospects. That
is why there is a strong emphasis on molecular genetics, because no-one can dispute that this
area has been a major growth point in recent years. But I ask those who feel that more
physiological matters have been neglected to pay close attention to the actual content of what
might seem abstruse molecular biology; much of the research reported in these contributions
is in fact classical physiology approached with new and powerful tools. They are all about
how the genome and the cell biochemistry interact and that, in anyoneâ€™s book, has to be
physiology. Much of the valuable discussion which followed the presentations is recorded in these
proceedings.
