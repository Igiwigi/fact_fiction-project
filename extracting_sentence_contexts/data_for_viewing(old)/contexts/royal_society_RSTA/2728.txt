is associated with energy conservation [13]. Similarly, symmetry of the electromagnetic field is : =
expressed through gauge invariance [14]. 3
In the current article, we propose that transformations of force fields from one form to the iB
other are linked with loss of invariance of at least one physical quantity resulting in a localized : =
symmetry breaking of the associated field in the localized region of space and time which :B
generates a Noether current which is globally conserved. In that context, we argue that loss of : o
invariance in the temporal domain of a force field causes loss of invariance in the spatial domain : >
of a corresponding physical quantity and vice-versa. For example, potential energy of a body is 73
transformed into change in momentum when the symmetry of the potential energy surface is a

locally broken by some external agent. These observations converge towards our novel discovery
of the fact that in Maxwell’s equations on radiation, the globally conserved Noether current is
generated as a consequence of localized symmetry breaking of an electromagnetic field. At a
global level, it plays a critical role in defining the global symmetries expressed through gauge
invariance and generation of electromagnetic radiation.

According to Maxwell, radiation is generated due to acceleration of electrons [15,16]. This
aspect was further highlighted and put on a simpler mathematical framework by Heaviside
[17,18]. An important contribution of Heaviside was reformulation of the initial Maxwell’s
equations in quaternion form into a vector form comprising of four equations in terms of electric
and magnetic fields and charges (static and dynamic) [19].

There are some physical instances where electron acceleration does not result in radiation, in
apparent violation of the Maxwell’s theoretical prediction. For example, an infinitely long wire
