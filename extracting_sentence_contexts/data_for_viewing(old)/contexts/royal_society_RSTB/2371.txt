210 DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE “BLAZE CURRENTS”

excited to its maximal blaze current, I have always found this latter to be accom-
panied by a marked increase of conductivity. This alteration was shown by the fact
that a standard deflection by yg'55 volt was found to be increased sometimes by as
much as 50 per 100. In such case, however, since the total resistance in circuit was
unknown, it was not possible to translate this obvious increase into its value in ohms.
But this much it was possible to see with certainty, Ist, that the altered conductivity
was similar to both directions of testing current, and 2nd, that it subsided with
subsidence of blaze.
SF The principal difficulty that stands in the way of exact measurements of resistance
& arises from the fact that the testing current itself excites retinal discharge in a given
8 (“ positive ”) direction. The phenomenon of apparent “ irreciprocal resistance,” due
& to organ discharge in one direction only, is thus presented by the eyeball precisely
By as by an electrical organ.* Deflection caused by a homonymous induction shock
aD sent through eyeball and galvanometer in series is greater than deflection caused
g by a similar but heterodrome shock. The algebraic sum of positive shock plus
Sp positive discharge is greater than the algebraic sum of negative shock plus positive
discharge.
