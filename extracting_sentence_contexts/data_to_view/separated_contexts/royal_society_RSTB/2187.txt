The cerebral circulation, although greatly diminished, is not entirely stopped by
these means in cats and monkeys (and some dogs), for in these animals the abdominal
blood-vessels and those of the hind limbs are sufliciently supported and confined by
the taut abdominal wall and skin, even though the muscles have lost their tone. In
other words, animals with a tight drum-like abdominal wall are protecied from the
effects of suspension, while those with a loose abdominal wall are in danger of
syncope. This fact I have clearly demonstrated on rabbits by the following experi-
ments* :â€”

I. Strong Grey Hutch Rabbit. 2.15 p.m, Suspended by the ears and fore feet, head upwards. The hind legs were
fixed in the extended position.
