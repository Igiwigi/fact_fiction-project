Turning now to the hindmost region of the attachment in Holocephali, figs. 11,
12, the question arises whether it represents an otic process, either alone or in
combination with other elements. A study of the morphological relations of the otic process with surrounding
structures throughout the vertebrate series (DE Brrr, 1926, a) has made it possible
to establish the following definition: the otic process is a part of the pterygo-quadrate
which articulates or fuses with (or shows evidence of having previously articulated
or fused with) the auditory capsule, in such a manner as to be morphologically
anterior to the spiracular visceral cleft, lateral to the vena capitis lateralis, anterior,
lateral, or latero-dorsal to all the branches of the facial nerve, and to the mandibular
blood-vessel as represented by the efferent pseudobranchial artery, and posterior
to the branches of the trigeminal nerve. Now, a glance at fig. 1, which is a graphic reconstruction as seen from the left side
of the skull of a 95 mm specimen of Callorhynchus, shows that despite the fact that the
region of the pterygo-quadrate in question is stretched backwards horizontally (0p),
it bears all the prescribed relations of an otic process to the vena capitis lateralis,
and to the trigeminal and facial nerves. There can be little doubt, therefore, that
this structure represents an otic process, slightly displaced topographically so as
to assume the horizontal position, as a result of the extreme anterior position of the
articulation of the upper with the lower jaw. The question now arises whether the otic process is accompanied by and fused
with some part of the hyomandibula: a possibility which has been envisaged
(Goopricx, 1909), and which it is all the more necessary to decide since in such a
form as Acipenser (DE BEER, 1925) the hyomandibula bears the same relations to
surrounding structures as does the otic process, except that it is posterior instead of
