full amount. Hence -
dT/T=0-054/4:51 x 0'8=1-5 per cent.

During the second part of the experiment the movement of the zero continued in
the same direction, which must be interpreted as a falling-off in the surface tension of
the right film, which was now becoming black.

As the black extended only from 7'5 to 18:5 mm.,

dT/T==—0-004/4'51 x 0.6=—015 per cent.

This experiment illustrates the importance of obtaining, if possible, two meagure-
ments with the game pair of films. The fact that the change in the magnitudes of
the principal diameters went on without reference to the thinning of the films is
strong evidence that that change was not caused by the alterations in their relative
thicknesses,

Experiment XI.

The same films were used as in Experiment IT. The final observations in thab
experiment gave 0'18 as the initial difference of the diameters. At the end both films
were first thickened by the current and then flooded. The value of 8 found was 0-44.
The mean of the two values is 0:32.

During the greater parb of the time that the experiment lasted the current was
