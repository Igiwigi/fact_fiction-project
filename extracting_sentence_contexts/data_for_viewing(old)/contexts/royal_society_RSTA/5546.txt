Coronary artery disease (CAD) represents the first cause of death worldwide [1]. A literature : =
review reported 5-18% prevalence of CAD worldwide [2]. It consists of progressive stenosis : §
of coronary arteries, which reduces oxygen supply to cardiac cells and can lead to stroke and to
death. Stress testing is the most commonly used method for CAD diagnosis prior to coronary : <
angiography due to its non-invasive nature and the fact of being non-expensive. Nevertheless, Dh
the accuracy of conventional stress test electrocardiogram (ECG), mainly based on the analysis of : S
the ST segment, is limited, presenting low sensitivity and specificity [3-6]. In the meta-analysis 8
by Gianrossi et al. [6], sensitivities ranging from 23 to 100% (68 + 16%) and specificities from : S
17 to 100% (77 417%) were reported. ECG markers quantifying information from other ECG 1S

waveforms and time intervals could increase the accuracy of stress testing and provide valuable
prognostic information.

Altered autonomic function has been associated with CAD progression and increased
mortality [7,8], probably due to increased sympathetic nervous system modulation, as suggested
by heart rate variability (HRV) measurements [9-12]. These changes in autonomic modulation in
CAD patients have effects not only at the level of the sinoatrial node activity, as reflected by
