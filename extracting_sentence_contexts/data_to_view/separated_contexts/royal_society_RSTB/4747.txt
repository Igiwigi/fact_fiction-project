A good summary of their distribution will be
found in Minne Epwarps’ ‘ Legons sur la Physiologie,’ vol. 3, 1858; it is sufficient
here to point out that their structure and composition is far from being similar in all
cases (MiitneR, 17, p. 275); and that, although there is noticeable a tendency to
their formation in aquatic air-breathing animals, both birds and mammals, their
occurrence depends neither on blood relationship nor on a universal similarity of habit,
for they are to be found in creatures of such different mode of life as fish, birds, ungulates,
cetacea, edentates and lemurs. Tt is a remarkable fact that in spite of the curiosity that these structures originally
aroused, little attention appears to have been bestowed upon them for the last fifty
or sixty years. This lapse of interest may no doubt be attributed to the predominant
importance assumed in more recent times by purely morphological anatomy, although

when looked at from a physiological standpoint, there is no question that these vascular
adaptations are of very considerable interest and deserve more study than they have
hitherto received. Among the retiform modifications of the vascular system that have been described,
one of the most remarkable is a large paired spongy mass of intermingled meshworks
of arteries and veins interposed between the liver and the pericardium of the —e
Shark (Lamna cornubica).
