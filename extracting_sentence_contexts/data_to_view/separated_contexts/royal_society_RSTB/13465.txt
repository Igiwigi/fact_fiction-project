Being aware of the presence of dishonesty, we examine electronic supplementary material, table S3), even if scores
whether gossip was believed and was incorporated into from rivals did not affect individuals’ payoff.

(i) Reliability of gossip

Using multilevel ordered logistic models, we found that,
regardless of all other factors, gossip about rivals was more
negative (8 = —0.29, p < 0.001, model 1; electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S1) suggesting that players tried to
improve their own position to the detriment of rivals. When
the competition was low, in the cross-checking condition, we
did not detect any dishonesty about rivals (6 = 0.42, p< 0.05,
model 2; electronic supplementary material, table S1), which
means that the opportunity for cross-checking significantly
holds back negative gossip about rivals compared to the
control condition. This apparent counterforce disappeared
in high competition (6 =-—0.86, p<0.01, model 2; electronic
supplementary material, table S1), despite the fact that dishon-
esty has not been intensified by competition (6 = 0.27, p = 0.18,
model 2; electronic supplementary material, table S1). Apart from the distortion created by rivalry, gossip was
sent in an honest way in the sense that it was aligned with tar-
gets’ PD decisions (if sender was an involved PD partner in a
given round): if the target defected, then gossip was less posi-
tive (6 = —-1.36, p< 0.001, model 2; electronic supplementary
material, table S1); while if the target of gossip cooperated
with the sender, then gossip was more positive (6 = 1.35, p<
0.001, model 2; electronic supplementary material, table S1). Since senders were not always in direct encounters with
gossip targets, gossip could rest on players’ private repu-
tation assessment as well.
