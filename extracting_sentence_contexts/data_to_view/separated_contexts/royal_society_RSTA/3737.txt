The results of WarBuRG and von Baso* have shown that for gases near their
critical temperature, there is a great increase of viscosity as the critical pressure is
approached. Meyer explains, and at the same time confirms this result, by a calculation based
on the assumption that the gas is a mixture of double and simple molecules. The relatively large value of the exponents of p (see page 236) in the case of carbon
dioxide and nitrous oxide, may be accounted for by the above fact. Tt has been shown that the conductivity of a gas is proportional to its viscosity.
staking into account that even the so-called permanent gases diverge considerably
Strom Boyeâ€™s law at the higher pressures, it seems probable that the constancy of
Bhis conductivity is far from absolute. 5 A glance at figs.
