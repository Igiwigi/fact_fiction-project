of the water.

When these circumstances have been attended to, spermatozoa may be sometimes
seen at the zona pellucida of the envelope within the first minute, though only those
that encounter the egg at right angles; but in from four to five minutes many may
be visible, according to the number contained in the water. After the Japse of some
time, varying with the temperature, the formation of the chamber may be noticed
over the centre of the dark snrface of the yelk : it is usually at this stage, and for a
Short time afterwards, that the spermatozoa are first detected in, or passing into, the
vitelline chamber.

First set of observationsâ€”An observation was begun at 11 28% a.m. with the
temperature 60* Fan. of the room, though possibly it was three or four degrees
higher to the eggs, from the radiation of the lamp.
