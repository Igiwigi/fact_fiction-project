THEORETICAL EXPLANATION OF. THE SOLAR PHENOMENA.

Â© We have admitted, in order to explain the generation of shal-
lows, that a transparent elastic gas comes up through the open-
ings, by forcing itself a passage through the planetary clouds.
Our observations seemed naturally to lead to this supposition, or
rather to prove it; for, in tracing the shallows to their origin,
it has been shewn, that they always begin from the: open-
ings, and go forwards. We have also seen, 'that in one case; a
particular bias given to incipient shallows, lengthened a number
of them out in one certain direction, which evidently denoted a
propelling force acting the same way in them all. | I am, how-
ever, well prepared to distinguish' between facts observed, and
the consequences that in reasoning upon them we'may draw
from them; and it will be easy to separate them, if that should

= hereafter be required.

'S If however, it be now allowed, that the cause we have assigned
E. may be the true one, it will then appear, that the operations
8 which are carried on in the atmosphere of the sun are very
= simple and uniform.
