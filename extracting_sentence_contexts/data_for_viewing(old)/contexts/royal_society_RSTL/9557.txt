the convolution, whilst towards the sulci the layer gradually becomes shallower. The
gradual increase in size of its constituent cells from above downwards, which is 80
prominent a feature in the human brain, is not observed here, the deeper cells of this
layer being identical in point of size with the more superficial cells bordering upon the
8econd layer. Not only are these cells very constant in 8ize throughout the depth of
this layer, but they vary very slightly in magnitude throughout the whole surface
of the cortex. An approximate average from a very large number of measurements
may be given as 23 in length by 13p in breadth, and the longesb diameter of their
nucleus as 9p. On reference to the table of measurements we shall find that, whilst
the upper series of cells in this layer in Man and the Carnivora do not reach this
magnitude, the lower series in Man are far larger, whilst in the Cat the lower series
correspouds exactly in 8ize with those of the Pig. It is important to bear in mind the
fact that the lowest stratumr of the third layer in the Cat is formed of cells identical

whilst none of the smaller cells crowding the upper portion of this layer in Man, the
Monkey, and the Cat are here present. The nerve-cells of this layer vary much in
contour : we find them oval, oblong, pyriform, and pyramidal, and a few even elongate
