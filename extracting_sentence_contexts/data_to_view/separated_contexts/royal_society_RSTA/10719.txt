There is no trace of any fracture or dislocation, and the marks cut by the
tide on this shore show that there has been no change of level, or, at any rate, none
of more than a few inches. Everything points to the slipping of loose, gravelly and
sandy deposits piled on the steep submarine slope which characterises this coast. There is no difficulty in believing that a similar process has gone on at Wallibu and
Morne Ronde, and this will explain most of the facts observed. Mr. Roprrrson, of
Wallibu, left for Chateaubelair on Wednesday, the 7th May, about 12.30 pm.
