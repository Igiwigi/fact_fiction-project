Lipry’s formula gives 10104, differing by
0°54 per cent. If Lispry’s formula had been employed for the reduction, the heat-
loss, instead of being nearly the same for the different flows, would have appeared to
vary from 3°38 for the largest flow to 1'79 for the smallest flow. The heat-loss
should, as a matter of fact, have been slightly less for the large flows than for the
small, because the rise of temperature of the jacket J with the smallest flow was
rather more than sufficient to compensate for the fall of mean temperature of the
thermometer-pockets. Seeing that the results of the continuous-electric method have now been so closely
verified by the continuous-mixture method, which is independent of electrical energy
measurements, it would appear to follow that the discrepancy of 1 per cent. at 80° C.
between these methods and those of Messrs. BousrretD and Lisprn is to be attributed
mainly to fundamental differences in the thermometrie and calorimetric methods
employed.
