For this, consider as a very simple example the following formula

(Aa (A> B)A(-AVC)A(CAB3D))>D. (2.2)

Figure 1 shows two (syntactically) different proofs of that formula in Gentzen’s sequent calculus
LK [35,46]. The attentive reader might immediately observe that the two proofs only differ in
the order of the application of inference rules and that one can be transformed into the other by
a series of simple rule permutation steps. In fact, sequent calculus proofs are often considered
equal iff they are equivalent modulo rule permutation. However, recently it has been shown that
equivalence of sequent calculus proofs modulo rule permutation can be PSPACE-complete [47],
which violates Objective 1 stated above and renders it unfeasible to base proof identity on rule
permutations (unless P = PSPACE). AN(A> B)A(AAVC)A(CAB>D) 3D Ag \F 6 |
