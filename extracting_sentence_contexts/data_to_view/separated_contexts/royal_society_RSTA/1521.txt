While this has resulted in tremendous leaps in understanding, there have been some aspects
where we have failed to advance for decades. In most accounts, this can be traced to failures in
representation of the form of sub-gridscale phenomena such as clouds. The solution may come
when we in fact no longer need to seek representations, as we shall be resolving such phenomena
directly. We have noted possible setbacks to this approach given physical limits on computing
technology. We have gazed into the computational abyss before us, and seen how ML may offer ways to
adapt to what todayâ€™s machines do best, which is statistical ML.
