I admit very considerable difficulties
of interpretation and would refer to the discussion on pp. 58-62. Here I would only
direct attention to the rather large number of primordial genera found in each case
(Table LV, line 7, p. 54): to the comparatively limited range of values of + (4-26 to
6-28, ibid. line 5): and to the comparatively limited range also of the values of Â¢
(1-188 to 1-925, ibid. line 6). Subject to the admitted difficulties of interpretation,
the results of this test, on the one point on which direct comparison can be made with
the facts, could hardly be better.

* If there are N genera in the data, and one primordial genus would only yield n genera after the given
lapse of time, we must have No = N/n.


28 MR. G. UDNY YULE ON A MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION,

The next point considered (Section V) is the frequency distribution of ages for genera
of a given size: given, that is to say, N existing genera all of the same size, we require
to know how many of them are likely to be of each successive age.
