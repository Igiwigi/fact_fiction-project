So far the deductions made from
the results of the experiments with steady air-currents are in accordance with
observation. For values of @ between 0 and > curves intermediate in form between those in figs. 10

and 16 are obtained. @When @ is greater than 0, V, no longer represents the velocity

of free convection from the grid, but is more nearly the component of the free convection
along the axis of the microphone. ‘That is, V, is approximately equal to V cos 9,
V being the velocity of free convection from the grid. If this were strictly true, we

should have V, = 0 when 6 = a but this is not generally the case, probably owing

to the fact that the loops are slightly displaced and do not lie in a plane which is just
at right angles to the microphone axis, and it may even happen that they are not all
in the same plane. For example, in the case of the grid used in the experiment just
described, it was found that :

V, = 1°225 ems. per second when @ = 0,
and

V, = 0°25 cm. per second when 6 = =

As an approximation we may take V = 1°225 and V, = Vcos(@+a@) when @ is

near = so that

1225 cos ‘e +a) = 0°25. Whence

a=-ll’,

and we should have V, = 0 when @ = 101°.
