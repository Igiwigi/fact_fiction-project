fe other factor is easily found to be
S —P(P(X*+Y* +2") +3IXYZ).

Svreral of the formule given in the sequel conduct in like manner to unsymmetrical
tensformations of a cubic form.
26. I remark also, that the last-mentioned system of equations gives, 8ymmetrically,
A EYES WD: EXE XY!

= =YZ—PX?: ZX—PY*: XY—0P2*: PYA—IX*: PAX —IY*: FXY—l7*;
and it is, T think, worth showing how, by means of these relations, we pass from the
guation between X', Y', Z! to that between X, Y, Z. In fact, representing, for short-

X'=AF=GH, Y'=BG=HF, Z=CH=FG, ABC=FGH;
a thence

But we have
