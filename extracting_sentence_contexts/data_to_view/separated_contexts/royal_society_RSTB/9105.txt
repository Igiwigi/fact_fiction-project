This can be due to species- or strain-derived
differences in pathogenicity [54,65,66], dosage dependence
of infection risk after exposure [21,40], or different expression
or efficiency of host sanitary actions [51,52,54,66]. Note that a
reduction in allogrooming from nest-mates to exposed indi-
viduals has not yet been reported in any previous study. Assuming that this is not an effect of publication bias, it
might be due to the fact that ant societies either rarely face
highly infectious pathogens or that their social defences, par-
ticularly allogrooming, are extremely efficient in reducing
disease spread in the colony. The latter is supported by the
vast literature on social immunity (reviewed in [2,67,68])
and the fact that allogrooming is largely universal among
eusocial insects (ants [5,24,25,32,38,40,47-50]; bees [67-70];
wasps [71]; termites [21,51,52,54,72]) and in other complex
societies (e.g. primates and meerkats [10,19]).

4. Conclusion

In an experimental ant-fungus system (Lasius neglectus ants
and Metarhizium brunneum fungus), we observed significant
changes in grooming patterns upon fungus exposure, as
exposed ants (i) increased individual self-grooming rates, and
(ii) reduced allogrooming of nest-mates.
