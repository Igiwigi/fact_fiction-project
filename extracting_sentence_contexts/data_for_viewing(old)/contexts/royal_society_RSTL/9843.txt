The last paragraph contains a discussion of the evidence adduced in this part of the
paper, and a short recapitulation of the observed facts in the solar system which bear
on the snhject. This is probably the only portion which will have any interest for

THE THEORY OF THE TIDAL FRICTION OF A PLANET ATTENDED BY ANY
NUMBER OF SATELLITES.

F 1. Statement and limitation of the problem.

Suppose there be a planet attended by any number of atellites, all moving in
circular orbits, the planes of which coincide with the equator of the planet ; and
