The genus Lycopodium, again, with its remarkable uniformity of the sporophyte,
shows great variety of form and habit of the prothallus.{ It is true that we may
see in these only modifications of one common plan, but still the genus serves well to
teach how plastic and adaptive the prothallus may be in plants whose sporophyte
retains a uniform character. Lane has rightly pointed out the biological importance
of this variation. He remarks§: ‘Since the struggle for existence tells largely upon
plants in their attempts to seize upon fresh situations, it becomes all important in the
case of a vascular cryptogam that favourable modifications should take place in the
prothallus. It is thus, on @ priori grounds, quite comprehensible that a genus of this
group, which is known to have had a long geological history, might retain the spore-
