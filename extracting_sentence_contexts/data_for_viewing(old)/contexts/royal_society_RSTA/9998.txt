It seems certain, therefore, that a wire giving a large leak due to its having been
heated in hydrogen can be heated to a very high temperature in hydrogen at a very
small pressure for several hours without evolving an appreciable amount of gas.

On another occasion a wire was kept at about 1400° C. from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m., and
the pressure did not rise more than 0°005 millim., although the wire was giving a
large leak, due to its having been heated in hydrogen. If we admit that a wire
giving a large leak does not necessarily evolve gas, we may explain this in two ways.
Hither the wire contains no hydrogen, or it contains hydrogen in a state of very stable
combination. In the section of this paper on the effect of hydrogen on the resistance
of the wire it is shown that heating in air diminishes the resistance at the same time
that it destroys the leak. This seems to show that the surface layers of the wire
contain hydrogen which is burnt up by the air. The fact that platinum black absorbs
very much more hydrogen than solid platinum also points to the conclusion that the
-absorption is mainly a surface effect. The presence of hydrogen in a wire can be
tested by heating it in oxygen and observing the pressure before and after heating.
If hydrogen is present it will form water which will be absorbed by the P,O;, and so
the pressure will be diminished. Rrcarpson (loc. cit., p. 45) describes an experiment
of this kind and observed a diminution in the pressure. In this experiment of
RioHarpson’s a wire at 900° C, in hydrogen at 26 millims. pressure gave a negative

leak 4x 10° times greater than the leak at the same temperature in oxygen. On
