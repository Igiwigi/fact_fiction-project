Such differences actually exist in the body
of Paramecium. The theory which best explains the facts is, therefore, practically
the same as the statocyst theory developed for higher animals, except that instead
of a complicated sense organ and reflexes, we have the whole mechanism of stimu-
lation and response in a single cell. Whether we accept Lyon’s explanation or not, it seems to be quite clear from his
observations, and others previously quoted, that neither JENsxy’s “ perception of
pressure” hypothesis nor DAvENport’s. “reaction to resistance” hypothesis is
necessary to account for the facts observed. All that we can conclude from these
investigations is, that the effect of gravity brings about a movement of motile
organisms either upwards or downwards, that, as Lore (06) points out, the precise
nature of the determining factor in the reaction is very obscure, but that the
direction of the movement varies under the varying conditions of temperature
(Massart, Moore), food supply (Moore), mechanical shock (Moore), and light
(EsTERLEY). To what extent the aggregation of Euglena and other micro-organisms described
