answer. A player might ask ‘Is this dog a ‘Cairn terrier?’ This is apparently not owing to experts believing their partner


knows more about the expert dogs than do the experts.
Experts very rarely made queries to their partners about
breeds for which they were experts. Instead, a plausible
hypothesis is that when the novice partner queries the expert
for advice, then the expert’s confidence in their own knowl-
edge increases. This is consistent with recent empirical
results showing that the act of giving advice to others increases
one’s confidence [36]. In fact, in one study, giving advice raised
self-reported confidence more than receiving advice did [37].
This latter result is consistent with our finding that experts
giving advice increased their self-reported understanding
more than did novices receiving advice from experts. The
increase in experts’ self-reported understanding when they
are put in dyads was not, alas, preceded by actual improve-
ments in their accuracy. Experts in the dyad and individual
conditions did not differ in their actual accuracy. Accordingly,
the experts’ metacognitive judgements (i.e. a judgement about
their own cognition) were biased by their social context. This
biasing effect of social context is also suggested by the result
that for single experts, their self-perceived understanding
