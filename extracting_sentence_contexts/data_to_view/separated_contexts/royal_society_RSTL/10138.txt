ending some distance behind the thick sheath ; this appearance is due to the fact
that the section was nob quite in the middle : the proper structure of the notochord

chordal cartilage thickens it on the inside. The folds of the nasal capsules (na., ol.)
are brought into view, and the cartilages (29.), both of the capsule itself (ol.) and of
the external nasal tube (e.9.7.) are cut through, very near the mid-line.
