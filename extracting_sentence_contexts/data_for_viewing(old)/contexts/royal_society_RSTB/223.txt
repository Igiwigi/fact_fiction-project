a The knee is thus represented all over the entire lower limb area, the total number of

movements observed being 141 (¢/: Ankle).
Further on we shall draw attention to the fact that the movements of the knee are

(ii.) Primary Representation.—The knee we have observed to move primarily only

Consequently its réle as a joint of

primary movements, i.e., of hip and other joints.
