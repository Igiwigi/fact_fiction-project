turning to early phases again, abnormal cell-divisions are occasionally met with ;
8@ are not to be ascribed to oblique cutting of the sections, for the presence of a
tinuous vascular strand has in each case been taken as a criterion of the section
ing truly in the radial plane. In such sections it may occasionally be seen that the
perficial cells divide again, very early, by periclinal walls; the inner cells thus
rmed (0, 0, figs. 61, 62) are believed to be added to the sporogenous tissue, but
iis has not been distinctly proved. In view of the fact that such additions to the
sorogenous tissue are constant in Hqwisetum, as above described, there can be no
priori objection to this view, which will also gain further strength from facts to be
leseribed in the case of Isoetes.
