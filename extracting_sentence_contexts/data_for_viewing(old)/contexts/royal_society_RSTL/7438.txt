Z In course of the year 1861, the instruments hitherto in use at the Flagstaff Obser-
Aratory, were replaced by new ones just received from Munich, and in the month of May
the necessary adjustments were s0 far advanced as to allow of the registration of the
new instruments being commenced with the beginning of the month of June. It need
