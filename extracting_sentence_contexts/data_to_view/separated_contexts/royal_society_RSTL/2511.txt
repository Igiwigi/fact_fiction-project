An inspection of my tables will show that in four years, in the five monso0n months,
from the maximum height 28:1343 inches, thermometer 76*4 in October 1827, to the
minimum height of 27:570, thermometer 75? in July 1830, the range amounted only
to +5643, difference of thermometer attached 14. In looking over Mr. GoLpixGnam's
tables for twenty-one years at Madras, the greatest annual range (with a solitary ex-
ception of 1430 inch in a terrific hurricane in May 1820,) amounted to 9640 in 1818,
and the greatest monthly range was in October of the same year *7940 ; the smallest
annual range was *4620 in 1814; in fact, the annual range very rarely exceeded
six tenths of an inch. I found the mean monthly pressure of the atmosphere at its maximum in the
coldest months, December and January ; it gradually diminished until July or Au-
gust, the most damp months : and gradually increased again until the cold months. Mr. GoLpixcnam's means of twenty-one years give nearly the same results ; the maxi-
mum pressure 30:085 inches, thermometer 75168, being in December or January ;
it then diminishes until May, June, and July, the mean height of the barometer,
29860, thermometer 86-907, being nearly the same in those months.
