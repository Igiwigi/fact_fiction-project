strain, distortion is accompanied by certain complex changes of density, which depend
on the arrangement of the particles. Thus, if a bag of shot or sand be shaken into the
stable arrangement which corresponds to maximum density, and then be subjected to
stress by (say) compression between two planes, the density will at first diminish, and
then, as the stress is increased, will pass a minimum and begin to increase. $0 the
thermoelectric quality of a piece of iron which has been shaken into a condition of
molecular stability changes, first, towards (say) positive and, later, towards negative
(fig. 31), when stress is applied and increased. Here, however, we are dealing with a
quality, which, unlike density, is directional ; and the changes have, in fact, the
reverse signs from those just stated if the direction of the applied stress is reversed.
Thus, let « (fig. 34) be a point expressing the relation of thermoelectric E.M.F. to

demagnetising by reversals. If from this point, we go on loading we have the curve

The property of dilatancy, which Professxor REyNoLDs has shown that granular
media possess, does not in itself afford any clue to the changes which a directed
