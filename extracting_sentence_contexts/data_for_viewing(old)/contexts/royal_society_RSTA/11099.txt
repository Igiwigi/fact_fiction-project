in the gaseous state.* Of these, two, mercury and hydrogen, are not related to any
others whose indices have been determined. ‘The remaining twelve all conform to
the rule} The probability that these coincidences are fortuitous is small. But if
they are not, the extreme simplicity of the relations raises the hope that some
fundamental property of matter may be involved.

If we attempt to go beyond the elements whose indices have been determined in
the free state and enquire how far the refraction equivalents lend support to the

* I do not reckon arsenic, since M. Lu Roux himself did not place much reliance on his result, and the
present enquiry renders it still more dubious. :

+ It is a strange fact that the index of Hy is practically identical with that of Ne., but whether this is
more than a pure chance it would be hazardous to conjecture.

hypothesis of simple relationships running through every family of elements, it must
be admitted that the figures are not encouraging.

The most hopeful series is that of the alkali elements, in which we find that the
constants for K, Rb and Cs are 7°85, 12°1 and 19-2, numbers which stund very nearly
in the relation of 2, 8 and 5; but lithium and sodium do not show any tendency to
fall into their places, and none of the other series of elements promise any better
