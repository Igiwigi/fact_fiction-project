XXVIII. On the Annual Variation of the Magnetic Declination, at different periods of
the Day. By Lieut.-Col. Epwarp Sapixs, R.A., F.P. and Treas. of the Royal Society.

Received April 30,—Read May 22, 1851; Revised October 1851.

THE interest which papers recently communicated to the Royal Society have ex-
cited in regard to the physical explanation of the Annual and Diurnal Variations of
> Terrestrial Magnetism, makes it extremely desirable that the facts which are to be
Q explained should in the first instance be clearly and fully comprehended ; and that
© for this purpose, the different classes of facts, which undergo much additional com-
2 plication by being viewed together, should be distinguished apart, and that each
S class should be presented separately, combining at the same time, as far as circum-
S stances may permit, facts of the same class obtained from different parts of the
[= globe.
& Under this impression I have deemed that an acceptable service might be rendered,
Z by arranging in a small compass and presenting together the Annual Variations which
= the Magnetic Declination undergoes at every hour of the day at the four Colonial
= Observatories established by the British Government at Toronto, Hobarton, the Cape
-2 of Good Hope and St. Helena ;—<stations selected, it may be remembered, with the
a express view (amongst others) of affording, as far as any four stations of equally con-
> venient access might be expected to do, the means of generalizing the facts of the
= Annual and Diurnal Variations in different quarters of the globe. I have attempted to
