smallness of the planet, but the figure in the fourth column would seem to suggest
that rotational instability must have played a large part in the creation of the
Martian satellites.

If, on the other hand, we begin by regarding the planets not as a fortuitous
collection of bodies, but as a series of satellites all ejected from the same primary, the
case is different. For here we should expect the smaller planets to have cooled more
than the heavier ones, and therefore to be at a lower temperature. Against this
must be set the fact that the heavier planets will probably have the greatest
concentration of density about the centre, and the greatest mean pressure. ‘The first
consideration tends to increase the value which we should expect for the mean
density of the smaller planets as compared with that of the greater ones; the second
consideration tends in the opposite direction. We can hardly profess to estimate the
relative weights of these two considerations with any approach to accuracy ; perhaps
it is best to revert to the argument given in the last paragraph, while bearing in
mind that the approximate equality of our numbers may become considerably less
significant as soon as the question of relative temperature is taken into account.

§ 29. We now consider the evidence afforded by the absolute value of our figures.
After allowing for the exceptional cases, it appears that the value of \, for the earth
and for most of the planets is about 4 x 10'. In other words, if we suppose these
