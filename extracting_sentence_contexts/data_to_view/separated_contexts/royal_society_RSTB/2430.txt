In Todea the “ filmy” habit is accompanied by a
smaller number of spores per sporangium. The fact that some species of
Hymenophyllacee have a larger output per sporangium than any others of the
Gradatz or Mixtee, gives the series a special significance, if as the genus Todea
suggests, the “filmy” habit leads to reduction of the output per sporangium,

The transition from the Gradatze to the Mixtse has probably taken place through
various lines of descent, and, as we may believe it to have been a more modern change,
so we find the steps of the transition quite clearly indicated in living species. That
such a passage from the basipetal to the mixed sorus did take place, seems to
me to be the only explanation of the facts stated at length above for the genera
Dennstedtia, Microlepia, and Davallia, while these lead on naturally to the bulk of
the Pteridez. A reasonable probability of a similar transition has also been made
out for the Cyatheacew, Woodsia, Hypoderris, &e. The biological considerations
brought forward above confirm the probability of this view.
