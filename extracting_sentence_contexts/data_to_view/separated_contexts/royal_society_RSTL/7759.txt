For when he localizes the first beginning of the affection © to the right or left hand of the
foramen centrale,” he certainly means the centre of vision, as also below when he speaks of yision being perfect
at tho foramen centrale: yet when he afterwards speaks of the parts affected extending from tho foramen
centrale to the margin of the retina, © as if they were related to the distribution of its blood-vessels,” he is
certainly thinking of the optic disk, the punctum cecum, whence the yessels radiate over the retina,


250 DR. HUBERT AIRY ON A DISTINCT FORM OF TRANSIENT HEMIOPSIA. It is quite inconceivable that the blood-vessels of one retina should be disposed in
perfect unsymmetrical correspondence with those of the other (the left side of one
agreeing with the left side of the other, and the right with the right); and in fact they
are not 80 disposed,. And even if they were, and if the phenomenon were due to their
disturbance, its spread would be ruled by geometrical radiation from the punctum cecum,
where nerve and vessels enter the eye, not from the © yellow spot at the centre of vision;
and we should have two unconformable spectra, one on each side of the centre, perhaps
overlapping, but certainly not coinciding, since the puncta cwca are not corresponding
points in vision. Sir David Brewsr7ER's experience seems to differ a little from Dr. WoLLastox's, the
« shaded darkness” of the latter contrasting with the words
