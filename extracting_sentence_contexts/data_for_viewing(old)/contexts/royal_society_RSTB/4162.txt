materials, and which are classed in the two groups Astrorhizidee and Lituolide? In
the former group, the caleareous-shelled Foraminifera, it is difficult, if not impossible,
to make the remotest guess at what influences the organism in secreting its
marvellous investment as presented in its most elaborate forms.' As GAMBLE has
said, in dealing with the Radiolaria, ‘So complex and diverse a tracery seems
utterly beyond the needs of simple Protozoa living under apparently similar
conditions of pelagic life; and though attempts have been made to explain this
manifold skeletal development in terms of cytoplasmic structure, its variety still
evades biological treatment,” and he expresses the hope that as we come to regard
the skeleton as a response to the varying media, stresses, and strains that fall upon
the cytoplasm from within or from without, its utilitarian character will be more
completely recognised.? Speculation is paralysed when one is confronted with the
fact that of two groups of the same zoological order, composed of the same simple
protoplasmic element and living under precisely similar conditions, one group should
secrete from an identical environment for the purpose of constructing its shell
calcium carbonate, whilst the other constructs its test of strontium sulphate.* As
Denpy has pregnantly observed, “The fact that one organism will select silica,
whilst another selects carbonate of lime from the same sample of sea-water and for

1 A scholarly discussion upon, and an attempt to solve, these problems is afforded by F. Dreyer
in two elaborate articles, the first in the ‘Biologisches Centralblatt’ (vol. 9, p. 333 (1889) ), and the
second in the ‘Jenaische Zeitschrift fiir Naturwiss.,’ 1892 (p. 219), to which the student is referred.
Abstracts of these papers were published in the ‘J. R. Mier. Soc.,’ p. 768 (1889); p. 767 (1892).
