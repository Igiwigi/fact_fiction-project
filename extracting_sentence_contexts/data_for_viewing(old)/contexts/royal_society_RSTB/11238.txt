agglomeration method in R on a subject dissimilarity matrix acquisition (median = 43%, range = 3â€”79%) and low levels of

was then pruned using the Dynamic Tree Cut package [13] that were maintained following reinstatement (median = 23%,
using the hybrid method. range = 0-39%). This represents a group that experienced a

successful long-term reduction in fear, and the maximum
freezing score observed following reinstatement for this

(b) Results group, 39%, is very close to the criterion of remission (37.5%)
The cluster analysis identified seven homogeneous subgroups that we established using a completely different approach
in terms of patterns of freezing 24 h after acquisition, at the end and sample in Study 1. However, the fact that the majority of

freezing profiles for all 215 subjects are graphed for each of prior to extinction suggests that the success of this subgroup,


like that of many human patients, may depend on having less remission rates and 95% Cls

of subjects who showed high levels of freezing following Ext+ MB |.
