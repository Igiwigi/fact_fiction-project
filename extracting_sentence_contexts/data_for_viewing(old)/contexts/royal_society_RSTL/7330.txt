Although we have not as yet obtained with certainty acids originating from the replace-
ment of more than two of the atoms of hydrogen in the methyl of acetic acid by alcohol
radicals, yet there can be little doubt that the third atom admits of a similar substi-
tution ; and we have, in fact, obtained indications of the formation of acids depending
upon this threefold replacement—an operation which, if carried out with amyl, would
obyiously produce triamyl-acetic acid, possessing the composition of margaric acid :
