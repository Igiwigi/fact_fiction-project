review of the literature bearing upon this question. A tolerably complete account of
the subject, up to the date of his paper, has been furnished by H. V. Neat (’98),
who also appends a full bibliography.

The well-nigh schematic clearness of the neuromeric differentiation in the cephalic
plate of Ornithorhynchus absolves us from the necessity for any lengthy discussion of
criteria employed in their recognition, We are, however, disposed to agree with
Neat in his remark (loc. cit., p. 252) that “local thickening” is a more essential
characteristic of a hind-brain neuromere than the commonly accepted criteria ot
a radial arrangement of cells in the neuromere, and the crowding of the cells in the
zones of constriction between neuromeres. These latter characters are, nevertheless,
not wholly absent in the case of the neuromeres in Ornithorhynchus, in spite of the
fact that here we cannot trace the operation of any extrinsic “ mechanical influences ”
such as NEAL imagines may be the factors in determining such nuclear arrangements.

According to Neat, the best criteria to test the neuromeric value of any given
division of the neural tube are “such as associate the supposed neuromeres meta-
merically with other structures known to be segmental, ¢.g., the mesodermic somites
or the segmental nerves.” In Ornithorhynchus, however, at the stages examined by
us, there is an entire absence of every trace of segmentation in the very scanty
mesoderm of the head, so that there can certainly be no dependence of neuromeric
segmentation on the segmentation of the mesoderm in this case. And, in view of
the association of the Trigeminus ganglionic Anlage with a series of neuromeres, it
is obviously impossible to apply the test of association with a segmental nerve to the
determination of such a question as, eg., the genuine neuromeric value of the
