The above reasoning applies only to the order of magnitude of the latent
heat. It is obvious that until we know the disposition of the molecules within the
crystalline structure the value of a’, is somewhat vague. But the experimental fact
that the latent heat of transformation of iron from the ferro-magnetic to the para-
magnetic state is of the same order of magnitude as the latent heat of fusion of many
diamagnetic crystalline substances is powerful evidence that the local forces and
local polarization which we have assigned to diamagnetic crystalline structures are
enormous, comparable, in fact, as the above and preceding calculations have shown,
with the intense forces and polarization of ferro-magnetic substances. In the crystalline state we must regard the molecules as orientated into definite
positions with respect to their neighbours by these large intermolecular forces. If at
the higher temperatures the molecules undergo rotational vibrations about their mean
positions, then it would be expected that the value of I* will be somewhat lessened
by these vibrations, and we should therefore expect that a small fraction of the
energy associated with the grouping would be dissipated as the temperature is raised
towards the fusion point.
