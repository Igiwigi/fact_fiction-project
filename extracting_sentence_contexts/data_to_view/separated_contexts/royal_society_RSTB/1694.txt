The
6 figure cited from Memoir XVII. demonstrates an interesting point, confirmed by other
ospecimens, uamely, that the anomalous medullary tissues extend through the leaf-trace
spgap along the sides of the normal secondary wood. In the section from which this
: & figure was drawn, the zone of secondary wood is sub-divided by parenchymatous trace-
â€˜Ss gaps into four masses, each of which is completely surrounded by cambium. We

have, in fact, in this case precisely the anomaly described by DaANGEARD in Acantho-
2 phyllum.t It is probable that the new cambial divisions spread from the normal
Zcambium through the parenchyma of the leaf-gaps into the pith, just as Roprnson
found to be the case in Jodes tomentella.{ Thus in another stem, from which fig. 9

= was drawn, there is a small amount of anomalous wood (a*) behind the outgoing trace

E figured.
