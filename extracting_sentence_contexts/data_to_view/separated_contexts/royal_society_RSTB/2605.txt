294 DR. MARIA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

the fact that it became often fixed in genera remote from one another, while nearly
related genera, or even species, differed. The broad conclusions which J draw from such a review of the Madreporaria
are :—

A. Palaozoic—A. change, which was advantageous, showed itself in Cyatho-
phyllids and in Cyathaxonidx, as early as Silurian and Devonian times ; other types,
which did not participate in the change, or could not rapidly enough adapt their
disconnected habit of growth to it (e.g., the Cystiphyllids), became extinct ; before
the close of the Paleozoic era, rather abnormal “columellar” genera were fashioned
(e.g., the Clisiophyllids), but were apparently unsuccessful ; at the same time a large
group of genera (Zaphrentids) seemed to make no sign of change. B. Triassic and Jurassic.—The Madreporarian fauna was a mixed one, including
many unaltered, or little altered, Zaphrentids, a few true Cyathophyllids, a great
number of altered Cyathophyllids (Astreidz, Thamnastreine, &c.), and a smaller
number of altered Zaphrentids (Turbinolidse, Eusmiline pro parte).
