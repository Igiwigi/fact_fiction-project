their entire body is covered by a layer of keratine [31]. The
function(s) of bone ornamentation in Crocodylomorpha
must instead concern acidosis buffering and heat transfer
via the housing of vessel clusters straight over the bone
apical surface in connection with the blood vessels under-
neath, which are enclosed in the bone cavities within the
osteoderm core (spongiosa).

As a conclusion, we suggest that the vascular plasticity
of the post-cranial dermal bones in both Testudinata and
Pseudosuchia probably helped these clades make major
evolutionary shifts by offering various pathways to oxygen
and/or heat management. Despite the fact that upshifts in
vascular density often relate to an increased frequency of
internal low oxygen due to a freshwater or marine lifestyle,
we do not exclude that vascular density also relates to other
vital functions as well as historical and structural constraints
which drive the development and morphology of the dermal
plates [105]. The complexity of multi-functional roles of the
post-cranial dermal skeleton in both pseudosuchians and
testudinatans might be a reason why our phylogenetic
ANOVA revealed no relation between ‘vascular area’ and
‘ecology’ despite obvious differences between the lifestyle
categories. Our results however demonstrate that the
advanced development of a post-cranial skeleton in these
