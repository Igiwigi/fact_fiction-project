From these two experiments we find that drops originally positively charged to
19°5X10-* els. unit have had this charge increased to 23°910~° els. unit when
broken up on the air jet, the increase being 4°4 x 10~ els. unit per drop.

There is, however, in this result a slight error, due to the fact that when the
drops break up on the air jet a certain number of the fine drops produced are
carried upwards with the air stream and so escape out of the measuring system, This
loss was measured by the use of Simla tap water, which, as has already been
remarked, was found to be quite incapable of producing a charge, either by splashing
or breaking up on the jet. An experiment was made with tap water charged in the
same way as in the experiment just considered, and it was found that after breaking
on the jet the drops had lost part of the charge originally on them, both when the
charge was positive and when it was negative. The mean value of the loss was found
to be 5 per cent. of the charge on the drops.

With drops originally uncharged a 5 per cent. loss was of no particular account,
the experiments were not accurate to this amount ; but with highly charged drops a
