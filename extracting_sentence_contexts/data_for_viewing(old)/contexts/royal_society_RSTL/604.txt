remain unchanged under the influence of these two opposite
actions, that event would be a decisive proof of the equality of
the intensities of those actions.

The result of the experiment showed, that the intensitics of

those opposite actions were in fact 'equal; the bubble of spirit
of wine, which, by its motion, would have indicated the smallest
change of temperature in the ball of the thermoscope, to which
the hot and the cold bodies were presented, remained at rest.

On removing the cold body a little farther from the ball, to
the distance of g+ inches, for instance, the hot body remaining
in its former station, .at the distance of g_ inches, the bubble
began immediately to move towards the opposite ball of the
thermoscope, indicating an increase of heat in the ball exposed
to the actions of the hot and the cold bodies; but, when' the
hot body was removed to a greater distance, the cold body re-
maining in its place, the bubble indicated an increase of cold.
