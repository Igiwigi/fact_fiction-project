Specific adaptability
In the laboratory work it was found that certain inherent adaptations for withstanding
the adverse conditions of competition were present in fly populations. These will influence
the outcome of competition in the field. They are, in fact, among the most important of the
factors which do so. The extent of this influence will vary with the species concerned,

The adaptability of species to ranges of temperature within which functional activity
(i.e. oviposition and the like) can occur determines the minimum temperature at which
a given species can deposit eggs. No special study has been made on these lines for South
African blowflies, but it is known that this minimum temperature varies with different
species in other countries.
