The attenuation and ‘parenchymatization’ of the apical meristem, with concomitant
disappearance of vascular tissue, has been observed in other ferns (Wardlaw 1945). It has been shown that the shape of experimentally induced solenosteles, as seen in
transverse section, follows the contour of the incisions. Further evidence of this fact has
been obtained during the present investigations. Figure 58, plate 27, shows the vascular
system differentiated below an apical meristem which had been isolated on a rectangular
panel of tissue; the solenostele is approximately rectangular in cross-section. Solenostelic buds were common in the experimental materials under consideration.
