reflecting condition at the 100 km. level. As has been mentioned previously, the
frequency range of abnormal Region E reflexion in summer increases, though not
very regularly, to a maximum about noon.

is interesting, because of the midnight maximum of magnetic activity which is also
experienced there. It appears, in fact, that we can say definitely that nocturnal
abnormal Region E reflexion is associated in some way with weak magnetic activity.
Further evidence for such a conclusion can actually be noted during the course of
many magnetic storms which ultimately become intense, for the “ no-echo ” con-
dition is often preceded for a short time by abnormal Region E reflexions. Also it
may be noted that during magnetic activity the “no-echo” condition is often
interrupted (for example, during the day-time) by the sudden occurrence of abnormal
Region E reflexions, even though the frequency used is such as would normally be
penetrating to Region F at that time ofthe day. In this connexion it is quite possible
that the reappearance of abnormal reflexions may be associated with temporary
