Caution was needed before even these results could be accepted. Their validity
rested on (1) the catalysis by molybdate of the action of the residual organic peroxides
upon hydrogen iodide ; (2) the nitrogen peroxide being removed, and the residual
nitrogen peroxide being shown less than the residual organic peroxides ; and (3)
showing that organic peroxides added to the fuel could be collected from the engine,
and estimated by the same methods. In connection with (1) and (2), many control tests have been made, and a few
of the more important will be mentioned. (1) The fact that the molybdate solution
