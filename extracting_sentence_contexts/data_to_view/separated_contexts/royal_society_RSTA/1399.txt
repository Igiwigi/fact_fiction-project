Moreover, we remark that the damage in the frictionless case is much more developed than for the
frictional case. Indeed, the friction force reduces the tangential stress acting on the micro-cracks
and as a consequence the crack-growth is reduced (or absent) in mode II. This fact is more visible
for the cracks orientated at @ = +7/4 and at @ = 7/2. We have also noted that each damage pattern
