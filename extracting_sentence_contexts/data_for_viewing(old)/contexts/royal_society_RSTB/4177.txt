after closing this, cut the vacuum tube, together with the tap, from the pump. After
adopting this procedure we obtained readings of the same value before as after removal
of the vacuum tube from the pump. The kata-thermometer within the vacuum tube

was heated by a source of radiant heat, e.g., gas fire; the vacuum tube was then
cooled by immersion in water (at the same temperature as the observation chamber),
and after drying, placed in still air within the chamber. The rate of cooling from
100°-95° was then noted and compared with that of the kata-thermometer exposed to
still air at the same temperature. The difference gave us approximately the rate of
cooling due to convection. There is’ an unavoidable error due to the fact that the
kata heats the wall of the vacuum tube and thus the kata is surrounded in part by an
enclosure warmer than the walls of the chamber. This error naturally will be greater
when the chamber is cold. Table V. gives results as calculated and found by direct
measurement :—
