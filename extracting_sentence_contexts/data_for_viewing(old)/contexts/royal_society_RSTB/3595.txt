celled tissue of the flesh is a layer of fine elongated sclerenchyma cells which
presumably lay under the epidermis. The latter is not quite determinable, although
a thin crushed row of cells, to be seen in one or two places, may be epidermal.

In the layers of the outer flesh run a number of small vascular bundles, whose
number is not quite certain. They do not cause any moditication of the ground
tissue in their region, having neither bundle sheaths, transfusion tissue, nor
secretory canals associated with them so far as can be judged from the specimens we
have.

The Vascular System.—There is evidence of a double vascular system in this seed,
viz., a series of bundles in the outer flesh, and some tracheids in the inner flesh.
Notwithstanding the fact that the nucellus stood free from the integument down to
the base, there is no clear evidence of tracheal tissue in its layers, It is very
probable, however, that there may have been a nucellar series of bundles, and their
apparent absence in this plant may be due to a fault in the preservation.

The bundles in the integument do not show to advantage in the sections, and,
indeed, can only be seen here and there. Apparently both the inner and outer

series sprang from a strand entering the base of the seed from the scale, but the
evidence of the origin of the outer series is not complete, and it ‘is very possible that,
