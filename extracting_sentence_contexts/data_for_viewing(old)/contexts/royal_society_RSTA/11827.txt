386 PROFESSOR W. C. ROBERTS-AUSTEN ON THE DIFFUSION OF METALS.

these earlier experiments was to show that samples of lead (which were removed
sucking them from the upper part of the tubes into stems of tobacco pipes) al:
revealed the presence of weighable quantities of gold after a lapse of the first
hours, while a sample withdrawn at the end of a second period of three hours did n
indicate the presence of a commensurate amount of the precious metal. This
either pointed to defects in the method, to the transmission of gold by convecti
curreuts, or to the very rapid diffusion of gold when minute quantities of this

are present in lead. I believe that the latter will ultimately prove to afford the
explanation of the facts observed.

The vertical tubes were then replaced by U-tubes of wrought iron, each limb
which was 230 millims. long and 10 millims. internal diameter. The tubes
filled with lead, and heated externally in a bath of molten lead, in an appli
which will be described immediately, and the precious metal, in the form of a ri
alloy with lead, was inserted into one limb of the tube. Experiments proved
the gold falling by gravity became rapidly and uniformly distributed through t
column of lead in that side of the tube, a.b., Fig. 1, into which it was introduced,
