Generalized transport equations are needed for the description of heat, mass, momentum
and electric transport in systems comparable to or smaller than the mean-free path of the
corresponding microscopic carriers. Furthermore, one would like such equations to be compatible
with the second law of thermodynamics. These apparently simple statements constitute, in fact,
a complicated and debated program [1-12]. Three main questions underlying it are:

(1) Is it truly worth the effort of obtaining mesoscopic transport equations, or would it
be better to go directly to the microscopic level and work on the basis of computer
simulations of the systems?

(2) In which circumstances is the existence of mesoscopic transport equations conceptually
consistent, meaningful and practically useful?

(3) What is the form of the second law of thermodynamics at mesoscopic levels?

Let us discuss briefly discuss these three questions.
