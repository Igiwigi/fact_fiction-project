in very regular order, the smaller cells as in Membranipora, growing from the upper
and inner sides of the larger ones immediately below them.

It is evident that in the construction of the cell, Membranipora and Notamia are
closely allied, and notwithstanding the encrusting character of the former species,
and the ramified habit of the latter, it would be easy in imagination to convert the
one into the other by supposing two lines of growing cells, such as are often seen in
M. pilosa, to be attached back to back to each other: from these similar branches
arising the encrusting species would be converted into the ramifying one. And the
further passage of this to the arrangement in Flustra is accomplished simply by the
union of a parallel series of such branches.

Such then are the principal facts that have offered themselves to my notice during
the investigation of the above described species. They afford evidence of the ex-
istence of a very decided type of structure, and one which presents a remarkable
uniformity of character, notwithstanding that it was observyed in genera differing con-
siderably in less important particulars. To what extent, however, this prevails, and
how far it may be modified in other genera, are considerations which must be re-
served for a more extended inquiry to determine. Among the points requiring
further elucidation, one of the most important is the condition of the neryous system.
No trace of either nerves or ganglia could be detected; yet the attributes of a nervous
system were 80 clearly exhibited as to leave no doubt but that this must exist, and
probably in some degree of perfection. Not only was the delicacy of their sense of
touch very strongly marked, but the operations also consequent upon the enjoyment
of such a sense were sometimes singularly striking. This is seen in the instant re-
