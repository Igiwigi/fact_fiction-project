As of 2010, the highest 30-year
probability in Japan, 99%, was calculated for a large earthquake with M ~ 7.5 in the Miyagi-oki
region, just west of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake source. However, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake
(M 9.0) was much larger than the long-term forecast. As detailed in the following sections, this
underestimation is due to the fact that the government's long-term forecast was based ona simple
‘characteristic earthquake’ model with seismological and historical data of past earthquakes in the
last few centuries.

Figure 1. (a) Plates around Japan with their convergence rates based on the REVEL model [1] and source regions of large
(M > 7.5) earthquakes since 1923 according to the JMA catalogue [2]. (b) Magnitude—frequency plot of earthquakes (M > 5)
which occurred between 1923 and 2014 based on the JMA catalogue [2] in the region shown in (a). Numbers of earthquakes for
each magnitude interval and cumulative numbers (see text for details). The original plots were made by using TSEIS system [3].
