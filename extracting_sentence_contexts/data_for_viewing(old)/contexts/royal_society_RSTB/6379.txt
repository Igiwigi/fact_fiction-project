The free-swimming period lasts about 3 hours.

The heart starts beating 40 hours after settling, while the stigmata function about
the same time as the post-branchial gut, 60 hours after settling.

As in Perophora, many tadpoles settle and grow normally while still in possession
of a mobile tail, as though there is a relative independence in the development and
function of tail and trunk.

The peculiar feature in the development of Clavelina lepadiformis, as also in
Clavelina rissoana, and Clavelina oblonga (egg 0-31 mm diameter), is that only 2 rows
of stigmata are formed in the post larva. This will be discussed later, although it
may be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the primitive number of
protostigmata in ascidians is two and not three, as some authors have suggested.

b—Clavelina picta (VERRILL), egg 0-48 mm diameter. The development of this
form is almost identical with that of Clavelina lepadiformis. As the egg is larger so
development is slower and the tadpole hatches by rupture, not 220 hours after fertiliza-
tion but after about 335 hours at 16° C. One striking feature is that some time
before hatching numerous purple cells appear along the endostyle and as a peri-
pharyngeal band. These eventually extend throughout the body and give rise
to the typical purple colour of the adult colonies.

The tadpoles have a free-swimming period of about 2 hours. The heart beats within
24 hours, reversing from the very first, while the stigmata function 36 hours later,
