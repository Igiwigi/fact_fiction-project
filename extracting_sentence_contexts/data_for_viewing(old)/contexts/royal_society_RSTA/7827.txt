the value of q for the upgoing wave always differs from the value of q for a downcoming
wave by an amount large compared with their rates of change per vacuum wave-length

upwards until it is absorbed. Calculation of the precise value of the reflexion coefficient
in a case when the effect of damping is such that the partial reflexion phenomenon is
important requires a more exact solution of the electromagnetic equations than that upon
which the ray theory is based. The fact that reflexion is only partial when damping is
taken into account means that the attenuation to be associated with the reflecting
stratum should be considered somewhat greater than that given by simple integration
of the imaginary part of g up to, and down again from, the level where the difference
between the values of g for the upgoing and downcoming waves is a minimum. If how-
ever we use in the reflecting stratum the approximate formula (31) for the imaginary
part of g, a slight error is made which tends to compensate that arising from neglect of
the partial reflexion phenomenon.
