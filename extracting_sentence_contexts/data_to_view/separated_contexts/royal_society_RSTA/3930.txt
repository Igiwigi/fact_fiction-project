sum of the times required for DSMC to run over the @ fraction of the domain and for LBM over the
whole domain, t,gm+psmc- In particular, for a = 0.2, more than a sixfold reduction with respect
to a full DSMC simulation is achieved. It has also to be noted that the computational overhead,
due to the fact that the LBM extends over the whole domain and not just over (1 â€” @), is very
limited. For the tested conditions, in fact, a full LBM simulation is about 80 times faster than a
full DSMC simulation, performed over the whole domain. The measured extra speed-up, defined
as tLBM+DSMC/thybridy Was found to be 25% for a =0.2 and 16% for w = 0.36. Such computational
extra gain may qualitatively be explained by considering that the LB information processed in
the bulk provides a higher quality, less noisy, input to the DSMC in the Knudsen layer than bulk
DSMC alone.
