S Should subsequent researches strengthen the probability of this working hypothesis,
'2 it 8eems possible that iron meteorites will be associated with the metallic stars and stony
E meteorites with metalloidal and compound stars. Of the iron group of metals in the
S gun, iron and nickel are those which exist in greatest quantity, as I have determined
E from the number of lines reversed. Other striking facts, such as the presence of
| 2 hydrogen in meteorites, might also be referred to.

> An interesting physical speculation connected with this working hypothesis is the
Z effect on the period of duration of a star's heat which would be brought about by
Sz asming that the original atoms of which a star is composed are possessed with the
J increased potential energy of combination which this hypothesis endows them with.
> Prom the earlicst phase of a star's life the dissipation of energy would, as it were, bring
2 into play a new supply of heat, and 8 prolong the star's light. May it not also be that if chemists take up this question which has arisen from the
E gpectroscopic evidence of what I haye before termed the plasticity of the molecules of
Â© - the metalloids taken as a whole, much of the power of variation which is at present
EZ accorded to metals may be traced home to the metalloids? I need only refer to the
EZ fact that, 80 far as T can learn, all 80-called changes of atomicity take place when metal-
S loids are involyed, and not when metals alone are in question.

| As instances of these, T may refer to the triatomic combinations formed with chlorine,
2 oxygen, suIphur, &e. in the case of tetrad or hexad metals.

5 May we not from these ideas be justified in defining a metal, provisionally, as a
A substance, the absorption-spectrum of which is generally the same as the radiation-

spectrum, while the metalloids are substances the absorption-spectrum of which, gene-
rally, is not the same?
