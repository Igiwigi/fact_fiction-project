where m is the gas particle mass and v, is the gas particle velocity in the z-direction. The
rebounding velocity is given by

By employing the fact that we control the macroscopic force Finstant =Ma(t) smoothly on
macroscopic time scales, so that for two subsequent collisions it is (on average) true that
a(t + At)A’ ~a(t)At, where At is the time elapsing between first and second collision at time t
and t + At and A’ is a the time elapsing between the second collision and the third one at time
t+ At+ Af# and, further, that L(t) = (L(t + At) — L(f)/At, we obtain
