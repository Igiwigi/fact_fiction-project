But no defendant can afford to ignore the risk of liability. As plaintiffs
experiment with other theories of liability and as the effects of global warming become more dire,
it seems only a matter of time before such a case succeeds, encouraging many other plaintiffs to
follow suit. I favour these litigation developments, but not because I see litigation as either a very efficient
or fair way of addressing impacts from climate change. (In fact, it is neither.) Rather, the risk
of liability—borne either by governments or private companies—could become a source of
substantial leverage for those advocating for deeper emissions cuts and more generous loss-and-
damage policies. Opportunities to trade legal claims for expanded aid are therefore included
in the PRF and the displacement facility described above. But nations should be careful about :
trading away too much, too soon.
