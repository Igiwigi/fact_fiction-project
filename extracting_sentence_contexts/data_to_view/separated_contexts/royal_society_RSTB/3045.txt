For the
best intumescences were formed at a high temperature on leaves floating on sugar. Only a few were formed on leaves floating on water if the temperature was sufficiently
high, or at a lower temperature if the leaves were supplied with sugar. These facts
support the conclusions to which my former experiments pointed, viz, that
assimilation is involved in the formation of intumescences. The results of these earlier experiments showed that they were worth repeating
under more favourable external conditions with leaves in a more responsive state. On June 9 the experiments were repeated with (a) potato leaves from plants

grown quickly in pots, first in the intermediate, and then in the cool pit; and
(6) leaves from potato grown slowly in a garden under ordinary conditions.
