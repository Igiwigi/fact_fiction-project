But if these statements were to be unreservedly accepted, these
operations would be inadequate to the purposes of the science; for the symbols of the
units of these substances, as expressed by the letters «, x, £, would be xt, x22, neces-
sitating in their construction the performance of an operation &, of which they had no
experience whatever,

The unit ez is the unit of a substance which the Laputians had, but which we have
not. It goes in our language under the name of the radical of formic acid. cx is the
symbol we assign to the unit of oxalic acid. I proceed to explain how the Laputians
dealt with this question.

«The accuracy of our experimentalists,” said they, © is beyond suspicion, and we

is necessary to inquire. How do they know, as their objections imply, that the gases of
which they have taken the densities are really homogeneous gases ?
