In each of these the yelk became slightly elongated, a symptom
which always precedes the first cleavage ; yet they did not undergo further alteration,

A but with the remaining four were abortive.

8 Twenty-three eggs were included in a large cell as a farther experiment, and each

E egg was touched once with the pin-point loaded each time, when the fluid employed
had been one honrand three quarters mixed with water. Four of these also had the

= chamber formed, and segmentation commenced in them, at the end of four hours

WD and a half; but | the majority were only partially fecundated, as only one of the

5 twenty-three eggs produced an embryo. The fact of this production, however, shows,

5 that an exceedingly small amount of influence, even at a long period after the fecun-
N

= datory fluid has been removed from the body in which it is generated, is sometimes
2 sufficient to occasion the development of an animated being; and that although a
S plurality of spermatozoa, supplied to the egg, appears always to be necessary to
S ensure fecundation, yet that the result seems to depend less upon the abolute given
Ss number, or numerical relation of these bodies, to the egg, than on the measure of
S vitality possessed by those which are brought into actual encounter with it, as a very
2 8mall number appears to be more efficient when employed immediately after their
< removal from the body, than a much larger number after a prolonged interval. Z (b.) Pin-head application of fluid.â€”The preceding experiments having been made
= With the smallest quantity of fluid, and consequently with the fewest spermatozou
= that could be applied directly to the egg, it was desirable to increase the number of
= these bodies without applying them in excess, and for this purpose the head of a very
5 small pin, the smallest size used by insect-collectors, was employed, instead of the
A point of a larger sized pin. An endeavour was also made, as in the previous trials,
to ascertain the number of spermatozoa which the head of this sized pin, dipped
lightly into fluid, was likely to be the means of conveying to the egg. 1t was then
found that the loaded pin-head deposited on a plate of glass, in the minute quantity
of fluid which adhered to it, from at least fifty to one hundred and fifty spermatozoa ;
a number which was not only fully sufficient to feeundate each egg to which the pin-
head was applied, but also other eggs which might happen to come into contact with
these in the same cell and water in which the experiment was made.
