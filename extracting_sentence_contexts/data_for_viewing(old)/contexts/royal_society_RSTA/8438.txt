where 45-1 (#, h), je; (a, h), ‘qs-1 (a, h), s-1 (a, h), He) (aw, h), all > 0 as h > O for fixed a.

Coefficients of the same powers of h on the two sides of the equation are now equal.
For, dividing by h and making h +0 (keeping ph constant) we see that the coefficients
of h are equal, as all the other terms +0. So for the coefficients of 2, h', h‘, and finally
the odds andends. (‘The fact that the e’s are evaluated at p+ 1h, and not at ph, presents
no difficulty, since the e’s +0 uniformly.)
