The sensilla themselves have the typical features of campaniform sensilla in that each
has a single sense cell whose distal process is inserted on the underside of the thinned
region of the cuticle by a fan-shaped chromophilic lamella (cp. Pringle 1938 4, pp. 120-121).
In these two groups the orientation of the fan-shaped lamella which, as always, is constant
throughout the group, is nearly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the haltere, i.e. at right
angles to the transverse corrugations. More accurate examination of a number of different
species of flies, especially Syrphidae where the stalk is curved, shows that the lamellae are,

in fact, orientated parallel to a line joining the intersection of the main and secondary
basal articulations (P, figure 5) to the centre of the end-knob. This is significant in the light
of the dynamical considerations outlined above.

From a mechanical point of view, a hollow structure with corrugations on the dorsal
and ventral surfaces and unfolded cuticle on the sides has differential flexibility in the
two planes. It is much more flexible to dorsoventral than to lateral bending. Here again,
as in the oval section of the stalk, we have apparently a device giving flexibility in the
plane of oscillation of the haltere, while preserving rigidity in the plane at right angles,
i.e. the plane of the gyroscopic forces.
