MICRASTER CORANGUINUM AND M. (UISOMICRASTER) SENONENSIS 389

considered to consist of effectively undamaged specimens, and the second to consist of
those which are damaged in some way or another.

Table 3 gives the number of specimens in each of the eight subgroups, together with the
numbers that would have been expected if Rowe’s standards of selection had been inde-
pendent of the position of a specimen in his classification. ‘he table shows that there are
more damaged specimens of Micraster senonensis and the passage form and fewer damaged
specimens of Micraster coranguinum auctorum and M. coranguinum var. latior than would be
expected if this were so. The value of y for the table is 10:46, and the probability of
exceeding this value on the basis of random sampling is between 0-01 and 0-02. Thus
Rowe’s standards of acceptability were, in fact, lower for his Epiaster gibbus and the
passage form than for Micraster coranguinum, and, on the basis of the collectable specimens
in the pit at Northfleet, the first two groups are over-represented in the sample.

Another factor may have been important, and, if so, it would have reduced this bias
in the sample. Micraster senonensis, and the passage forms, tend to have thinner tests
than the typical Micraster coranguinum. ‘This would make them more liable to damage in
collection, and so, with uniform standards of selection, under-represented in the sample.

If there had been, for any reason, preferential collection of either large or small speci-
mens, bias of another sort would exist in the sample. ‘The analysis which follows shows that
this is indeed the case; the more damaged specimens tend to be larger than the less
damaged. Rowe, or his collectors, had lower standards of selection for large specimens
