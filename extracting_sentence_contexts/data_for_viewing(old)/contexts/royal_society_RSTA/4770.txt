fuel injection jet, demonstrates the highest amplitude of gas temperature and a rather thick hot

zone in Y direction. Qualitatively, similar result was obtained for a water vapour concentration
distribution measured by TDLAS.

4. Mixing enhancement experiments

In this section, a problem of the mixing enhancement is explored owing to a mechanism of
gasdynamic instabilities developing at decay of after-discharge channel. It was mentioned in
the Introduction that such a mechanism is one of several direct and indirect ones that could be
realized at interaction of electrical discharge with a high-speed flow. The described mechanism
is based on an experimentally proved fact that a strongly turbulent gas motion develops in a
cooling post-discharge channel [33-35]. In experiments with a pulse sub-microsecond filamentary
discharge [36-38], it has been shown that there is one more, much faster, mechanism of the
after-spark channel expansion. In such specific mode, the expansion is driven by high-velocity
radial jets formed during the after-spark channel cooling. The second important feature of
the short-pulse long spark is a high selectivity of the discharge localization in medium with
gradient concentration of different components [24]. The discharge position is detected right in
mixing layer of some pairs of gases involved. Finally, it was demonstrated that the discharge
channel position can be effectively tailored by a little energy beam of a femtosecond laser [39].
Recently, the mixing intensification in high-speed flow due to filamentary discharge generation
was experimentally proven by means of analysis of flow disturbances and measurements of local
fuel concentration by method of probe breakdown fluorescence [40].
