The fact that the cyclic curves obtained from the metal in this state had somewha
rounded outlines, and gave values of [HdI, which, though by no means exceptionally
great, are greater than those given by the softest iron, led us to suspect that the
metal had been slightly hardened, either in the manufacturer's hands, or in o
coiling it into a ring for testing. Accordingly, we resolved to make another trial
after annealing the wire in the coiled up state. The ring (No. VIII.) was stripped of it
magnetising coil, and was heated to redness in a forge-fire, after which it was again
thoroughly soaked in a hot bath of boiled linseed oil. This treatment, besides
removing any hardness that might have been produced by mechanical operations, no
doubt had the effect of improving the insulation of the coils from one another, by coating
the wire with a film of oxide; and this may have contributed to produce an apparent
change of magnetic quality. On rewinding the magnetising coil, the following test:
were made with results which differ in a noteworthy way from those of the precedin
