s0 much only of intercellular tissue as will serve to connect them into a mass. A
certain number of these cells, by additions to their exterior, become lacunal cells.
We have then in the place of lacunal cells and dense intercolumnar tissue, lacunal
and osteal cells united by a small and almost imperceptible amount of a semifluid
intercellular medium ; the relative proportions of these several parts varying a little
with differences of age. Thus in aged subjects aggregations of lacunal cells may
here and there be found with but few osteal cells and but little intercellular tissue,
while in a young subject osteal cells will preponderate.

In all cases a direction may be given to the cells of a growing part, by their being
in relation with the insertion of a tendon.

A consideration of the foregoing facts will, we think, lead to a conviction that the
two different forms in which bone is developed, are designed to meet the require-
ments of the animal at different periods of life, and that bone developed by means
of osteal and lacunal cells is the higher form of the tissue. In early embryonic life
a oft, cartilaginous skeleton is laid down, which is hard as compared with the sur-
rounding parts, and capable of affording them the required amount of mechanical
support. As the various tissues advance in development the cartilage increases in
density by the elaboration of its hyaline tissue, and after awhile those changes occur
which precede its conversion into bone. But in the bone 80 formed, it has been shown
that the canaliculi anastomose only at those points where the lacunal cells come into
contact (Plate VIII. fig. 25). In bone formed from osteal and lacunal cells, the ana-
stomosis of the canaliculi prevails throughout the tissue, while the outline of the
