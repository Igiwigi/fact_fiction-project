Accordingly, the main features of
external form can only be of minor use in a system which is based upon comparison
of the sorus. But as an example where such facts may be of value Plagiogyria may
be quoted, in which the peculiar similarity of the sporangia to those of Dicksonza is
accompanied by the erect, more or less, aborescent trunk. Similarly with anatomy, which in a measure follows variations of external form,
though at such a distance behind as to give it an additional title to respect, anatomical
characters do not exactly follow those of the sorus, and cannot, therefore, be used as
a general basis for diagnosis, though anatomical facts have an interesting bearing in
special cases. For example, the sorus of Angiopteris is similar in many features to
that of Gileichenia, but the former has in its trunk one of the most complex vascular
