The experimental optimum of CO, for assimilation depends on the structural
3 porosity of the leaf, so that if this be reduced by blocking the stomata, even pure CO,
@ May not quite effect optimal assimilation. Â¢ (6.) To this, and not to the stomata being inoperative in gaseous exchange (which
& was Bousstncavuur's view), is due the fact that in concentrated CO, a leaf with its
stomata open assimilates less than one with the stomata blocked. (7.) In bright light a fully green leaf assimilates all the CO, that it is forming
by respiration and none escapes from it.
