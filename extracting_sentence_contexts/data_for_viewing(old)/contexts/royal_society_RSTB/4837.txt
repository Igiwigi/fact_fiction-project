when looked at from a physiological standpoint, there is no question that these vascular
adaptations are of very considerable interest and deserve more study than they have
hitherto received.

Among the retiform modifications of the vascular system that have been described,
one of the most remarkable is a large paired spongy mass of intermingled meshworks
of arteries and veins interposed between the liver and the pericardium of the —e
Shark (Lamna cornubica).

This rete was discovered by Jonannes M@uuerR and described by him in one of the
sections of his memoir, ‘ Anatomie der Myxinoiden” (17, p. 271). His description
and the diagram by which it is illustrated give a very fair presentation of the outstanding
structural facts, but, owing in part to the somewhat mutilated condition of his material,
the account is defective and does not show with sufficient fulness the relation of the rete
to the organs of circulation as a whole, or give a true picture of the extent to which the
rest of the blood-vascular system has been modified by its presence.

In a previous chapter of the same monograph (17, p. 238), Mitier draws
attention to another peculiarity of the arterial system of Zamna, namely, an
extraordinary contortion of the carotid arteries within the orbit. This modification,
which is shared also by certain other sharks, was further described briefly in a species
of Lamna by Trots (24), and again by Vircnow (26), but so far as I have been able
to ascertain, the above references include all that is known of the highly modified
vascular system of this genus.
