HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 383

As supporting the theory of displaced links, the mesh at 26000 (¢ 12 and No. 4) is
interesting. For the link 17256 is easily explained by the displacement in @
disappearing, and the link 17250 by its continuance to the line 22813. In fact the
sum of the two links is 2e—'24. From 26000 the link 14929 is not entered as it
is so small, but there are other examples of this small » in this map and the v
link appears to be a normal associate with an e mesh. Starting from §, there are four separations close to 17264 or e(—d,).
