The value of 4þ along the tore is
41V(p?—Xa?)

'The stream lines will of course in general be closed curves, having their extremities
on the surface of the tore ; one seb going through the aperture, and the other outside.


SMALL VIBRATIONS OF A HOLLOW VORTEX. 175

To find the point where the two sets meet on the tore, we notice that the stream line

© there goes to infinity, and its value is the same as for a point on the axis, ib is, in fact,
a part of the same stream line. For this p=0 ; hence the point on the tore, where
this stream line meets it, is given by the value of v, which satisfies the equation

(1 —WT+257 (1 yrs 4b cos nv=0

where T, are the values of T, when u=1.
It is clear that when & is very small, cos v must be negative, that is v>4m, or that
the point of division must lie inside a tangent from the centre to the tore.
& 7. Combined translation and cyclic motion. —The expressions just obtained enable
Sus to determine the amount of fluid carried forward bodily with the ring. Let &
Sdenote the ratio a?V/21þg ; then the stream function for the combined motion is
= 4
