The solution of the puzzle requires a change in perspective. The ensemble-average growth rate
is uninformative of the growth of a single entity (or, indeed, any finite cooperative) over time. From the perspective of an individual, it is the growth rate achieved by averaging over infinitely
many parallel realizations of its resourcesâ€”an irrelevant fiction. It is more realistic to assume that
an individual cares about its time-average growth rate, which better approximates what it will
actually achieve in one resource trajectory over time. We know from equation (2.8) that the time-average growth rate for non-cooperating entities is
8(xj) =" - o*/2.
