FARADAY’S “STEEL AND ALLOYS.” 235

(1898), the impression appears to be conveyed that Farapay’s research on steel and
its alloys was a failure. In his obituary notice of Farapay in the Royal Society
Proceedings, Bence Jonus goes so far as to say: “ The results of the paper on steel
by Sroparr and Farapay, to the Royal Society in 1822, were of no practical value,
and this, one of his (FArapay’s) first and most laborious investigations, is strikingly
distinguished from all his other works by ending in nothing.”

It may be that Bence Jonus, who in nearly every other subject valued Farapay’s
work most highly, did not weigh the full significance of the words “ ending in nothing,”
and allowance must also be made for the fact that he was not a metallurgist. Moreover,
he had not the advantage of being able to form an opinion, after a full examination
of the various qualities of these specimens of Farapay as is the case with the readers
of this paper, who can better understand from the description of Farapay’s
metallurgical researches, here presented, how much valuable information they contain.

It must also be remembered that Farapay himself appeared to underestimate the
importance of his achievements when. in June, 1820, he wrote to his friend Professor
GASPARD DE LA Rive, at Geneva, “ Pray pity us that, after two years’ experiments, we
have got no further; but I am sure, if you knew the labour of the experiments, you
would applaud us for our perseverance at least.”
of the great amount of labour involved, extending, as it did, over a period of five and a
half years.
