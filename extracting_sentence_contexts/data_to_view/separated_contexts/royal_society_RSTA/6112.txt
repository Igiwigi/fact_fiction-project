In the
context of networks and graphs, there are also highly compressible graphs in which the degree-
sequence entropy is maximal [15]. Thus, if one is interested in measuring irreducible information
content (or measuring the emergence of new irreducible information) in deterministic systems,
which are free of stochasticity, employing any fixed and computable measure based only on
finding and exploiting statistical patterns (in order to approximate the most compressed form that
computes the systemâ€™s behaviour) will exhibit limitations and face these obstacles in general. The
main limitation stems from the fact that most computable patterns are not periodic, the kind of
regularity that a statistical approach would be able to characterize. Computable but non-periodic
patterns will tend to have high statistical complexity (e.g. Shannon entropy with no access to the
underlying probability distribution) but low algorithmic complexity, meaning that a statistical
approach would assign them a random nature that, for all mechanistic and cause-and-effect
purposes, should not.
