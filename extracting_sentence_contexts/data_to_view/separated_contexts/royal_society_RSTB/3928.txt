THE INHERITANCE OF THE LARVAL SKELETON. In the large number of papers that have appeared on the subject of Echinoderm
hybridization the skeleton has been selected as the principal structure that has been
used in elucidating parental influence. â€˜This has been in great part due to the fact
that in the early pluteus, from four to seven days old, the skeleton is one of the most
obvious features. In many of the forms investigated, this structure has quite a
different arrangement; in some, the postoral arm skeleton being arranged in the form
of smooth calcareous rods; in others, the skeleton throughout is highly toothed or
covered with spinous processes; while again in others, the postoral rods are multiple
