(4.76)

A similar representation as (4.76)2 of the contact temperatures of the subsystems, 0! and @2,
is not possible because partial entropies of the subsystems are not defined for compound systems
with respect to the joint propagator and density operator (4.5). The entropy rate (4.14) does not
depend on the Hamiltonian or its decomposition. Partial entropies can be defined for decomposed
systems which are discussed in §5.

The entropy production (4.38); is not negative according to the Second Law (4.75)

D=-p-f=—p®.f>0. (4.77)

But pay attention to the fact that different expressions of the entropy production belong to
different controlled systems: (4.77); belongs according to (4.30) to a non-isolated system, whereas :
(4.77)2 represents the entropy production of an isolated system according to (4.31). The value of D8
the entropy production is equal in both systems because isolation of a system does not influence are
the entropy production according to (4.34). This difference of the meaning of (4.77); and (4.77) 1
comes into sight, if equilibria are discussed (§4f). 1

The propagator @¢om vanishes in conventional quantum mechanics and with it also the entropy : 3
rate and entropy exchange and production according to (4.71) and (4.74). The entropy itself :
is constant in time according to (2.15), and the heat exchange (4.55) vanishes in conventional
quantum mechanics. That is the reason why conventional quantum mechanics is characterized as
an adiabatical and reversible theory.
