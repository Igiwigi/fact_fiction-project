Our nonlinear
spectroscopy set-up has an option for measuring the linear transmittance spectra by focusing
white light to a 201m wide spot on the sample plane and consecutively measuring its spectrum
using an IR spectrometer. All measurements are carried out under normal incidence and with all the beams polarized
along the side of the sample periodicity cell. The numerical aperture for the pump beam was
equal to 0.15.

(c) Estimation of third-harmonic output via local fields integration

The fact of the higher TH yield upon pumping the MD resonances if compared with the ED
resonance is supported by estimating the overall nonlinear polarization within the nanodiscs. This has been done by integrating the local fields over the volume of the nanodisc. To simulate the nanodisc response to external radiation, we implement a model using 4 |
