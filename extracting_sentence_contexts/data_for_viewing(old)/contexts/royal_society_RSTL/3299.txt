produced downwards to another, I will only remark, that the sea in most situations
certainly does alter the form of its coast, and yet that an accurate map of any shore
gives a line indented in such manner, that a series of them, if placed one above and
a little behind another, would produce the same kind of furrowed surface which cha-
racterizes the mountains of Lochaber, as well as most others. I will further observye,
that when travelling along the shores of northern Chile and Peru, where the alluvial
action is reduced to an exceedingly small measure, and where it is not probable that
within a recent period there has been any great change of climate, I was repeatedly
much surprised at observing how absolutely similar all the minor inequalities of the
surface (yet covered with beds of sea shells of existing species) were to those of
countries, where almost every detail in outline is usually attributed to meteoric
agency; I could perceive only one difference, namely, that the larger valleys had un-
usually flat bottoms. Although fully convinced of the truth of this fact, I confess I
was astonished at discovering in the mountains of Scotland, which have been exposed
during a yast period to the destroying action of a wet and boisterous climate, clear
proofs that almost every furrow and inequality has been left nearly in the state in
which we now see it*, by the retiring waves of the sea. From the preseryation of
