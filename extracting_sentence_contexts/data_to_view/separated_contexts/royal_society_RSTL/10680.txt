The notion of inclusion
essentially involves that of a chain of classes with two terminals, viz., a class U which
contains all classes, and a class Z which is contained in all classes, of the chain. In
dealing with a class A we really deal also with the classes U and Z; and in dealing
with two classes A. and B we deal with the four classes A, B, U, Z. When this fact
is recognised, inclusion, as commonly conceived, is seen to be a relation which, as
far as the processes of exact thought are concerned, is accidental ; that which is
essential in it depending upon the places occupied in a system of clagses by two
classes relatively to two others (8c. 388).

378. The classes U and Z are not, apart from accidents, distinguished from any
other classes. The system of which the units are classes is a single one.
