and epiphytic forms grouped under 7'm. tannensis, Bernu. Tm. Vieillardi also appears
to have made unsuccessful attempts towards adopting an epiphytic habit. Indeed,
the whole genus may be said to be gradually relinquishing its primitive terrestrial home,
Tm. Vieillardi being one of the stragglers. The absence of roots in this primitive form is
a further indication, if such is needed, that the rootless habit of the genus preceded the
adoption of an epiphytic mode of life, and is not a reduction phenomenon.

5. The medullary xylem in the aerial shoot of Z’m. Vieillardi may be directly com-
pared with the central cauline xylem in the stele of Asteroxylon and Lycopodium.

6. In Tm. Vieillardi most of the scale-leaves on the transitional region of the axis
are supplied with leaf-traces, and these resemble the leaf-traces of Asteroxylon in the
fact that they stop short at the leaf-base, never entering the free portion, of the leaf.

7. In the aerial shoot of T'’mesipteris the phloem is not confined to a layer outside the
xylem ring, as commonly described, but more or less completely surrounds each
individual bundle of the ring. In longitudinal sections, not only in 7m. Vieillardi but
also in Tm. tannensis (vars. typica, elongata, lanceolata), the histological distinction
between the pith and the phloem abutting on its periphery is clear and unmistakable in
the author's preparations, stained in Gentian Violet and Orange G (Plate 5, fig. 12;
Plate 6, figs. 1-25).

8. The distribution of the phloem in the aerial stem of 7'mesipteris, considered along
with the rest of the stelar anatomy, facilitates the comparison of 7m. Vieillardi with
Asteroxylon and with Lycopodium.
