network planners will need to undertake proactive investment, in anticipation of connection
requirements from generation, taking real advantage of the economies of scale of transmission

The increase in automation and flexibility due to new generation, storage, network, demand and Dw
ICT technologies is paramount to face intermittent and uncertain power outputs from renewable :
generation and defer the need for conventional network infrastructure. In fact, any attempt to =
face the increase in renewables through current practices and without the adequate upgrade 1B
in emerging network technologies could be extremely costly and even infeasible [14]. To truly .
unleash flexibility, however, operators will need to control a much wider array of set points
to ensure that economics and reliability are maintained at acceptable levels. For example, it is
expected that in the UK generating units providing fast frequency control (i.e. fast balancing)
could increase from about 10 (large generating units providing frequency control) to some 600 000
(if 10% of small PV and wind units support frequency control); network automatic controls
such as voltage regulation devices could increase from 10000 to 900000; and automatic controls
in homes (energy management systems) could increase from virtually zero to 15 million (if
half of the installed smart meters were to link with energy management devices) [18]. Along
with the increase in control set points (and thus optimization variables), the amounts of data
available in operational time scales will escalate at all levels due to technologies such as smart
