As regards the source of the E.M.F. of the normally directed current of rest, it is
not in difference of reaction between the two surfaces, for the inner surface is normally
more alkaline to litmus than the outer, a condition that would, per se, lead to an
outgoing current. Moreover, I cannot see that mucin-metamorphosis can be adduced,
seeing that microscopic observation shows no evidence of this in the surface scales of
the epidermis.

It is more probable, as will be seen in the sequel, that the source of the E.M.F. of
the current of rest lies in glandular preparatory processes occurring in the secreting
elements of the epidermis.

The amount of the E.M.F. of the normal current is associated with the vigour of
the animal—a fact noted for the Frog by pu Bors, Bup@x (15), and ENGELMANN.

As regards the explanation of the abnormally directed current of rest observed


PROPERTIES OF THE SKIN OF THE COMMON EEL. 339

- often immediately after putting up the preparation, and especially in Eels fatigued in
the process of capture, it is possible that either or both of two causes may contribute
to its production : (i.) injury to the inner surface during removal tending to produce
an outgoing current ; (ii.) depression of epidermic activity from fatigue, or “shock” of
removal, causing a temporary diminution in the E.M.F. of the normal ingoing current.
