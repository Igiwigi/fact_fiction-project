(i) If collision stabilization is predominant 7. < Tp. In addition, if the process is to be
independent of pressure 7. < @. Hence @ alone must be of the order 10-9 sec.—a very
reasonable value. 7¢ must, however, be much less than this—say 3 x 107! sec. at 3 mm. Hg
pressure. This requires a very large collision cross-section for the deactivation process—
10% times the gas-kinetic value.

(ii) Radiative stabilization is predominant ifr, < 7,. In this case

& = 5x 10-71(0+-7,)-1 cm.3/sec.
Sh 10/7, cm:*)sec.,

since @ is much smaller than rp, which is unlikely to be less than 10-8 sec. In fact radiative
stabilization, for process A, can only occur through vibrational transitions or electronic
quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions, for which 7, will be greater than 10~° sec.,
will be negligibly small in all cases. This gives an attachment coefficient of less than
5x 10718 cm.*/sec., which is 10 times smaller than the rates observed by Bradbury.

For process B greater deactivation cross-sections are required even if allowance is made
for the possibility that several vibration levels of the O; complex may contribute. The
collision cross-section for deactivation of the complex must be some 10* times the gas
kinetic or the radiative lifetime less than 107!° sec.

The reason for the large collision deactivation rate is far from clear. For the Bloch-
Bradbury process or for our suggestion (II) a large quantum of vibrational energy must be
