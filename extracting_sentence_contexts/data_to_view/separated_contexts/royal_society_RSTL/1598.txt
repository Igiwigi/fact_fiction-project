My Dear SR, a Wetgand para
I HEREWITH transmit the details of the experiments which
have been made with the invariable pendulum, placed in my
hands by the Board of Longitude, at your suggestion. It is matter of regret to me, that I should have visited s0
many remote places, with such means in my hands, and have
80 few results to produce. The fact however is, that the ser-
vice upon which I was sent had no connection with scientific
research, and that it was only at casual intervals of active
professional employment, that I had any leisure for enquiries
of this nature. These occasional opportunies I owe to the
generous indulgence of Sir Tuomas Harpy, the Commander
in Chief, to whose assistance, also, and encouragement in
every pursuit having useful knowledge for its object, I stand
essentially indebted. In drawing up the following account, care has been taken
to state all the attendant circumstances, and to record in the
Tables every observation in detail ; 80 that any person wishing

to examine the work, may have the best means possible of
estimating its value.


212 Captain HALL's details of experiments

The methods followed for making the adjustments of the
instruments, conducting the experiments, and deducing the
results, were those laid down in your paper on the length of
the pendulum at the principal stations of the Trigonometrical
Survey.
