removed, the same changes occurred in invyerse order; the broad band split into two
lines, gradually the black thread alone was left, and finally that vanished, and the two
bright lines were restored.

(2) This experiment was then varied in the following way. Some pieces of metallic
sodium were introduced into a test-tube, and a long glass tube conveying coal-gas
passed to the bottom, an exit for the gas being also provided at the top. The sodium was
now heated and the flow of coal-gas stopped. In a short time the reversal of the D lines
was complete. 'The gas was now admitted, and a small quantity only had passed when
the black lines were reduced to threads.

In my former communications to the Royal Society I have pointed out the extreme
importance of these facts in connexion with solar and stellar physics. In observing the
swn by the new method, we get various Fraunhofer lines thickened in the 8pots and
thinned in the chromosphere and prominences ; and in these latter, in some instances,
notably in the case of F, we find the lines gradually widening as they approach the limb
of the s8un.

While this may be remarked as a solar demonstration of the correctness of the
conclusion at which Dr. FRAXKLAND and myself had arrived, it is to be noted that bright
line prominences may occasionally be seen on the sun's disk over or near spots in the
spectrum of which the same lines are thick, while this phenomenon could not exist if
the thickening of the lines were due to temperature alone.
