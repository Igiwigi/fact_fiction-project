There is exactly one way to do this: The sector angles diagonal to each other are
directly related by the rules in (iii). Since we know the sector angles around two of four vertices,
we use this relationship to determine the other two vertices. We then iterate using this basic fact. This iteration leads to the sector angles displayed in the 4 x 4 checkerboard in the figure. Note
the left boundary and right boundary have the same sector angles.
