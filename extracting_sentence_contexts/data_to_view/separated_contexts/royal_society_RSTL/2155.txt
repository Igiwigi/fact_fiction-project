HAYGARTH's Ob/ervations on te
table. The ſeventh table is compoſed by finding the ;
proportion of inhabitants in the different pariſhes ſepa»
rately and together in the fifth, to' the burials for ten. z
years recorded in the ſixth table, In the ſeventh table
the mortality of whites in Jamaica is taken from Dr,

LIND; of Liverpool and Mancheſter from Drs, ENFIELD
and PERCIVAL, Who directed particular ſurveys of thoſe *
towns; of the other places, both town and country, from ©
Dr. PRICE: fo that no facts can be aſcertained on more ©
reſpectable authorities. That the inhabitants of Cheſter If
ſhould have near an equal chance of living to twice the |
age of the inhabitants of Vienna, London, or Edin- |
burgh; and that no large town, as far as inquiries have
been hitherto made, ſhould approach to a nearer propor=
tion of longevity than as 28 to 40, are aſtoniſhing facts,
The center is by far the moſt ſalubrious part of the city;
the average of deaths within the walls is only x in 58, a
degree of longevity much ſuperior to what in general-is
recorded even of the country. The pariſhes which in-
clude the ſuburbs, v/z. St. Oſwald's, John's, Mary's, and
Trinity, are of the largeſt ſize, and comprehend many
central parts of the town which are undoubtedly as
healthy as any of the reſt, but they alſo contain all the
- out-ſkirts, which -onſequently muſt be much HP KU
healthy than appears to be the general average of deaths |
