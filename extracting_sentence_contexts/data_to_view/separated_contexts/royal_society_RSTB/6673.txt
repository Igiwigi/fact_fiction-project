A similar phenomenon was previously
observed in the development of the leg skeleton in vitro (Fell and Landauer 1935),
where the explanted bone rudiments “‘still had a short, stumpy appearance as com-
pared with a normal limb at the same stage of development”. It was concluded that
“this effect. ..was due to the fact that the conditions in vitro retarded chondrification. As the gross anatomical form of the long-bones is largely the result of differential
growth, retardation of the growth rate also involved retardation of anatomical develop-
ment, so that in vitro the limb skeleton chondrified at an abnormally early stage of
anatomical differentiation.’”” This explanation almost certainly applies also to the
subnormal anatomical development of the explanted sternum. From this it appears
that the shape of the sternum depends partly on the relationship of growth rate to
differentiation rate, and disturbances of this relationship produce abnormalities of
form.
