The
ostium is closely applied to the ovarian pocket so that the ova can pass directly from the
one to the other without the necessity of being swept by cilia through any part of the
peritoneal cavity. A somewhat similar apposition of the ostium abdominale to the ovary
has been described by Widakowitch (1908) in Torpedo ocellata. The fact that the diameter
of the infundibular part of the oviduct is smaller than the ripe ova has already been

mentioned; it is obvious that the ova must be considerably distorted while passing through
this portion, though they will have no difficulty in passing into the ostium which is com-
paratively very large. In most elasmobranchs the ostium is very small, although it becomes
wider in the breeding season.
