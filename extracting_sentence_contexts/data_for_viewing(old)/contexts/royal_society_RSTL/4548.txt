AMPERE invented a molecular theory, which led him to conelusions inconsistent with
it. For reasons not of a chemical nature only, but which had reference prin-
cipally to the propagation of light and sound and to other physical phenomena, he
had arrived at the idea that in every chemical substance there were what may be
called three forms of matter, the indivisible atom, the molecule or system of atoms,
and the particle or system of molecules. He conceived, moreover, that every gas
contained in the same space an equal number of these molecules. From this it was a
necessary inference, that in that contraction which takes place when oxygen and hy-
drogen combine to form water, a division must take place of the elemental molecule.
He considered that the oxygen divided, half a molecule of oxygen combining with
each molecule of hydrogen*. On this view therefore the atoms, even of the elements,
formed what was in a certain sense a compound group. The discovery of isomeric
forms of hydrocarbon in different states of condensation, and of other similar facts,
gave rise to new ideas as to the possible differences of bodies, and explanations simi-
lar to that by which the differences between certain isomeric organic bodies have
been accounted for came to be applied to the case of the elemental bodies themselyes,
Thus the allotropy of sulphur has been explained by assuming it, in its yarious forms,
to be the same substance in different states of condensation, in which case the dif-
ference between these forms might be expressed by giving to them the different che-
mical formulz of S, S,, S;. Those physical relations however of density and specific
heat, which might give a true scientific yalue to such speculations, and prove that
these substances were really thus connected, have not yet been made out to exist ; nor
indeed has any fact been discovered which places such a notion beyond a conjecture.
GRraHam again, to explain the mode in which the metals conduct electricity in the
voltaic circuit, assigns to these bodies what he terms a sali-molecular structure, and
