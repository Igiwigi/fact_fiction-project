Here 2g is the cube (0,1)4 in R4.

Here, B is a constant that depends on a and d, but not on 6. Remark 2.3. With minor modifications to the proof one can ensure that the velocity field u in
proposition 2.2 is in fact smooth, and satisfies ||1(-, t)||cx < C(a,d,k) for all t > 0. The proof of proposition 2.2 consists of two steps. The first step involves pulling back the shear
flow on the torus from lemma 2.1 to a compactly supported flow in R’.
