Hence, the first
criterion will be satisfied. Lastly, we need to show that the second criterion is satisfied. In fact, we modify the second
criterion and demand that the output state differs from a valid codeword by an error which is
correctable by our ideal decoder (the ideal decoder is our Look-Up Table Decoder assuming no
further errors). As discussed, this could be an error of weight-2. This modification does not alter
the use of this condition in deriving fault tolerance [27].
