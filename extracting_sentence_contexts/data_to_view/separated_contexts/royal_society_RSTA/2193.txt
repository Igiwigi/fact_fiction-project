This second direction of cleavage has also been observed more perfectly
developed on the four double sulphates containing ammonium as the R-base and as
M-metals, magnesium, nickel, manganese, and copper. It would appear to be connected
with some obviously probable slight difference of structure, due to the different and
more complicated chemical nature of the ammonium, radicle NH, as compared with a
simple alkali metallic atom. It is a fact which may prove later of value in elucidating

~ the exact details of this slight difference of structure, and one which will require to
S be remembered in considering the meaning of the congruency with the rubidium salts
By referred to in the preceding paragraph.

& Orientation of the Optical Ellipsoid.—This comparison is best effected by taking
Bthe position, in the crystals of the four salts, of that one of the two median lines

& lying in the symmetry plane which is not far removed from the vertical morphological
axis c, and which is the « axis of the ellipsoid in all four salts. This principal axial
direction of the optical ellipsoid is the second median line in.
