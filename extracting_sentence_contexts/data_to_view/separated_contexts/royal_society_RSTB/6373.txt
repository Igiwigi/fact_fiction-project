This specimen is figured
by pE Vries (1914, Plate 19) and also by Davis (1927, Plate 5) and was obtained
somewhere in eastern North America by Micuaux in the eighteenth century. The
luxuriance of Micuaux’s specimen indicates that it was perhaps a garden specimen
from seeds collected by him. The foliage of O. paralamarckiana is very similar to

Fic. 1—0O. paralamarckiana, culture 19.35.

that of the specimen in question, and in fact agrees with it in leaf shape more closely
than does the Lamarckiana of DE Vries because of the more pointed leaves of O.
paralamarckiana, but the Micuavux specimen has long petioles. There is, however,
a great difference between O. Lamarckiana and O. paralamarckiana in flower-size,
which almost certainly involves more than one factor for petal-length.
