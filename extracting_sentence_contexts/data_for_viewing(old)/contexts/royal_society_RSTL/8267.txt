-2 before such a method can be practically employed in the arts,
Although the working hypothesis which has suggested the various lines of research
> which have been followed is, I think, sufficiently clear, I refrain from dwelling upon
DV it until other researches now in progress enable me more fully to judge of its value, and
2 to state at greater length the various conclusions which may be drawn from it.

= Application of these Observations to the Solar Spectrum.

â€” These observations have an important bearing upon the solar spectrum, for the reason
D that, as is well known, all the lines known to exist in the spectrum of an element sup-
= poxed to be present in the sun's atmosphere are not in all cases reversed.

5 Before I proceed to give the facts in detail it will be well to go over the prior work
Q of Kironnovy and Axasrr6x, to ec precisely the evidence on which our present know-
ledge of the elements in the solar atmosphere, as determined by Kincnnoyy's method of
solar observation (that is, the non-localization or integration of the various solar
regions, such as spots, faculze and chromosphere), rests.

Kinennoyy, in his paper referring to FRAUNNOFER's prior determination of the double
line D being coincident with a double line observed in the spectrum of sodium vapour,
locates sodium vapour in the solar atmosphere, as Professor Srokes had done before him,

* The great lengths of the lines of sodium, lithium, &e. at once account for the delicacy of their spectrum
reactions.
