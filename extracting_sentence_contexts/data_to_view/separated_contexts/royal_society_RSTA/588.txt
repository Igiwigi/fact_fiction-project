Furthermore, figure 8 presents the N2O formation during the temperature ramp after
adsorption at 150, 175 and 200°C for ‘without’ and ‘with’ soot cases. In addition, the quantified
results for the N2O production are shown in figure 9. It is well known that the ammonium nitrates
become unstable at higher temperatures [29,46] and that this fact correlates with NO formation
(figure 9). In general, less amounts of nitrous oxides are produced when soot is present in the SCR-
coated filter after exposure to NH3, NO2, Oz and HO, evidently emphasizing the suppression of
ammonium nitrate formation or its easier decomposition in the presence of soot. This trend has
also been observed in our previous study conducted on SCR-coated particulate filter for NH3-SCR
reactions [36].
