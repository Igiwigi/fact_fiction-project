cases, for even after sections have stood in absolute aleohol for several hours the
yellow granules will still stain with Scharlach, but not so red as before. But
on warming sections in any fat solvent (absolute alcohol, ether, chloroform, ete.) the
substance which stains is soon dissolved, and subsequent treatment with Scharlach
produces no reaction, the granules remain a yellow colour and exhibit no trace of
red staining. A similar result is attained by treating the granules, in a fresh
section, with warm caustic soda solution; they will no longer stain with Scharlach.
From the above observations it is justifiable to conclude that fat is usually associated
with the yellow granules; either they contain fat or, possibly, are only enveloped in
a thin film of it. Although, owing either to the minute proportion in which the fat
is present, or to its chemical nature, it does not give a definite reaction with osmic
acid, its presence is demonstrated by the two facts—(1) the staining of the yellow
granules with Scharlach or Sudan, and (2) that it is only necessary to previously
“extract” the granules with any of the usual fat solvents or to treat them with
warm solutions of the caustic alkalies in order to render negative their reaction to
these stains. The proportion of fat associated with the yellow granules varies
widely in different specimens, but less so in regard to the granules in the various
cells of the same specimen. Occasionally granules are seen which do not react with
Scharlach, others show a weak reaction, but generally the reaction is quite clear.

The yellow chlorogogen granules remain undissolved even after lying for one
or two days in absolute alcohol, ether, chloroform, or xylol, all maintained at 50° C.,
but their colour is paler than at first. Caustic soda or potash solution, 5 per cent.,
acting for three days, has no solvent action upon the substance of the granules, but
