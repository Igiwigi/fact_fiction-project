At this period the two tensions are operating together on the
skull anteriorly, and this appears to be the essential, determining factor in the
divergence of the Flat-fish skull from the normal. The subocular ligament, which
develops in the tissues outside the skull, on one side only or on both sides (Solea),
between the palatine-lateral ethmoid anteriorly and cranium posteriorly, may be
regarded as a product of the tension. And the magnitude of the tension may be
judged from the fact that the skull suffers deformation under it even when strongly
ossified (e.g., Bothus). The principal changes in the skull and arches can thus be referred to the ventral
mechanism of the head; the latter is more or less asymmetrical from the beginning,
z.e., when the structures are forming, and its â€˜asymmetry must be derived from some
condition in the body. The asymmetries in the posterior region of the skull can
also be referred to the conditions in the body, that is, this part of the skull is under
the influence of tensions operating on the dorsal fin and superior pharyngeals
(ef., ante p. 87).
