The number of field-changes available is rather small for this fine subdivision, but
if the table be accepted at its face value the striking new fact which emerges is the
small value of the ratio V,/N_ for very close discharges. The effect is present among
both the simple and the complex field-changes, and the difference in the value of the
ratio N,/N_ in the first two rows of the table is so great that it can hardly be a chance
effect due to insufficient sampling. Before discussing the significance of these results
we turn to the consideration of the large number of observed field-changes due to
discharges whose distances could not be determined. These are tabulated according
to the magnitude and sign of the field-changes. In the case of complex discharges
separate figures are given for the bigger component only and for both components.
The tables which follow include all observed field-changes whether the distance of the
discharge was known or not.

If the numbers for simple and complex discharges be added together the following
