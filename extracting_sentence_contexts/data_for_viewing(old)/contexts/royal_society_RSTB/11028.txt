the chromosomes. Such interstitial chromosome repeats have
often been treated as a nuisance that interferes with our
measurements of the ‘true’ telomeres. The occurrence of these
interstitial repeats varies among chromosomes, individuals
and species. Furthermore, we assume that the level of these
repeats is stable within individuals, but this may not always
be so. We are only beginning to appreciate the diversity in the
occurrence of these interstitial repeats of the telomere sequence
and to understand their potential functionality [35-37]. This is
likely to represent an important area of future research.
