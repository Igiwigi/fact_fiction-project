In these
situations, attempts to impose sanctions for non-reporting
on the local scale are unlikely to succeed and will instead
further damage relations with animal owners and reduce
their engagement as partners within health systems. A more positive approach could be taken to promote the
value of reporting, building on small improvements and
rewarding change.

(iv) Regulations and rumours

Recognizing that there can be strong disincentives for
national governments to report disease outbreaks, the
revised IHR now include new powers for the WHO
to initiate a response to a PHEIC without official noti-
fication from the nation state in which it is detected
[2,36]. The move towards the use of such ‘rumours’
for detecting emerging disease threats has been
enabled by the recent advances in web-based technol-
ogies, and their importance is demonstrated by the fact
that the majority of recent outbreak investigations by
WHO were initially prompted by unofficial reports
[23]. Rapid assessment and response to rumours can
provide important health benefits, even in the event
of ‘false positives’ (i.e. disease events that turn out to
be neither novel, emerging nor of international con-
cern, but nonetheless cause morbidity or mortality). However, reliance upon rumour-based reporting also
has potential negative consequences [39].
