It differs from the regularly bicrescentic tooth of Paleotherium till more than from
that of Rhinoceros or Macrauchenia ; while in the lateral compression and flattening, and
the complexity of the posterior column, it shows a slight approximation towards £quus.

'The molar and premolar teeth of both upper and lower jaws thus without question
show strongly marked Rhinocerotic characters; but on passing to the examination of
the canines and incisors the resemblance completely fails, at least to the true Rhino-

ceroses, as all the latter have these teeth either quite rudimentary and deciduous, or,
when functionally developed, greatly reduced in number and separated from the molars
by a wide diastema. There is, however, an American genus from the Lower Miocene of
Dakota, to which Leipy has given the name of /yracodon, which, as proved by the
8ockets in the alveolar border, possessed the full complement of incisors and canines as
in Zomalodontotherium*. Unfortunately the characters of these teeth are at present
imperfectly known ; but they appear to have been more differentiated than those of
Tomatodontotherium, and in fact to occupy an intermediate position between that genus
and true Rhinoceros; 80 that, judging by the teeth alone, we may place 1omalodontothe-
rium, Hyracodon, and Rhinoceros as three terms of one series of modifications; and it is
quite possible that as Zyracodon is of greater geological antiquity than Rhinoceros, 80
Homalodontotherium may be a still more primeval type. The discovery of this new form throws some light upon the affinities of the very
enigmatical Nesodon and Toxodon. If, as observed by the first describer of those genera,
< the interval between Toxodon and Macraucheni is evidently partly filled by Nesodon”f,
Homatodontotherium is another link in the same chain connecting Nesodon with the true
Perissodactyles.
