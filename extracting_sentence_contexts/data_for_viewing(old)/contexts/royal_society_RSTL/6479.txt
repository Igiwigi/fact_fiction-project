$hould believe that it belonged to a neighbouring bog, mentioned by several writers,
«from which have been taken, several feet below the surface, many trees of the fir kind;
several 18 inches in diameter, together with pine-nuts, but no coal”.

In s8ome of the lower beds, close-fitting joints not unfrequently occur in the lignite,
the surfaces of which (rarely planes) have a high polish : the workmen call such pieces
« glassy ;” and the term aptly expresses the character. They also call them * slides,”
believing them to be © Slickensides.” There do not appear to be any © faults” in the
beds at the pit.

It has already been stated that the lignite often has a © charred” appearance; and
indeed it is somewhat difficult to believe that it has not ignited spontaneously ; nor are
we without facts which give some support to this opinion. It is well ascertained that
the combustion 80 prevalent in the heaps of refuse is spontaneous, and the lignite beds
are 8ometimes found to be on fire in the tunnels or © ends.” Mr. Diverr, writing me
on this question, says, © Some ten or twelve years since, I found a fire raging in an * end”
at the western extremity of the pit, which had been abandoned for some months. I
enclosed the main western * end* with a dam of timber and clay, in the hope of extin-
guishing the fire, but only sncceeded in checking it. This part of the pit was buried by
a run of clay from the north for many years, and was excavated again about twelve
months since, when the fire was still burning. Tt is now again buried by *run ' sand.
IT have never doubted that this ignition was spontaneous.” Mr, Harcnevr, however, who
gave much attention to the chemistry of the lignite, was of opinion that there was no
evidence of true combustion .
