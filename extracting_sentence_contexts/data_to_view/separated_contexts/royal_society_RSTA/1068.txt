In the case of the uncertainty relations, :R
we can either prepare our instruments so as to measure a change of momentum of certain : o
parts of those instruments or so as to locate the spot that registers an impact by a quantum 3
object, but never do both in the same experiment. The uncertainty relations are correlative :3
to the complementary nature of these arrangements. In fact, the use of conservation laws in : Ss
quantum physics is connected to the uncertainty relations because the complementary nature “sO

of ‘the space-time description and the laws of the conservation of energy and momentum’ [10,
v1, p. 94]. Could one still speak of the momentum or energy conservation in considering the
interaction of particles, say, as in the case of the Compton effect? Yes, of course!
