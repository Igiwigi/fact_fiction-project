L. N. G. FILON ON THE ELASTIC EQUILIBRIUM OF

lead to infinities, or at all events, to discontinuities in the stress. In other words,
that, though we have chosen our constants so as to make (rr ).-« formally zero, yet
the limit of (77) as given by the series is not zero when 7 approaches a. This
would suggest that the series for rr, considered as a series of I-functions, behaves at
7 =a in much the same way as a discontinuous Fourier series whose general term
is sin nz behaves at z =z. In fact, if we differentiate rr in the usual way with
regard to v and then put 7 = a, we get a divergent series. It is easily seen, beets | that no discontinuity really occurs except at the points
where the shear is applied discontinuously. The general term in rr is of the form
(dropping irrelevant factors) :
