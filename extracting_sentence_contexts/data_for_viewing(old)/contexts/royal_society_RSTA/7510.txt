derivatives. We may also calculate the initial curvature of the shockwave,

d(v+0,) [dr = Ky, +4N,d(fo+B,)/dr

(use is made of (5), (39), (6) and (35)), and the initial values of higher derivatives of both 3
and (w+6,). In this way we may try to construct a shockwave solution for any given type of
singularity of the Mach-line pattern, as has been done in Tollmien (1947) for one case in-
volving a cusp of a limit line. Alternatively, we may study the case where 6 = dd/dr = 0,
d*6/dr* +0, at the point where the shockwave starts, and thus seek to prove, eventually, that
any shockwave must start at a limit point if it starts with zero strength at a point in a super-
sonic region and if its strength is an analytic function of 7 near the point where it starts.

It should be noticed, however, that our argument is based on the fact that the shockwave
equations imply an infinite value of the component of the velocity gradient normal to one of
the Mach directions when d-> 0. The shockwave equations, in turn, are based on the assump-
tion that the width of the shockwave is negligible compared with the macroscopic dimensions
of the problem; this is true for shockwaves of finite strength, but not for very weak ones
(Taylor 1910). No case is reported where the position of the shockwave has been determined,
for the same problem, both from experiment and from the theory of inviscid fluid motion and
the shockwave equations.

7. HE REFLEXION OF FIRST-ORDER DISTURBANCES AT THE SONIC LINE

To complete our investigation of first-order disturbances, we discuss their reflexion at the
sonic line. The case arises in a nozzle with a sharp-edged throat, if the sonic velocity is reached
