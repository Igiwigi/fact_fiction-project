& (7.3) Suppose that p is a maximal ideal (of R), ¢ an integer between 1 and e, and m an
-2R-submodule of S such that

a S=m+ N (PS)qy

then S=m + Sy for any r>1.

I It must first be observed that

. D,PS)q = PS+ M1 (P'S)q, for any #51.

“gin fact, the ideals es) qj are respectively q;-primary, so the only prime over-ideals of their
&(direct) meet are qy,...,q,; the right-hand side is therefore the meet of its isolated com-
‘Bponents with respect to q;, ..., q, by (8-2). Hence the right-hand side contains the left; but
“Bthe reverse inequality is obvious. Substituting back, therefore

E S= pStm+ H PS) ay

a “From this, using (7:1), it follows that

S=p'S+mt+ N (pS),
