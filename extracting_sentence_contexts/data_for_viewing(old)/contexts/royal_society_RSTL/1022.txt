X. On some general llustrations and Applications of the fore-
going Facts and Principles, and Conclusion,

The general ideas advanced in the preceding pages are
evidently directly in contradiction to-the opinion advanced by
FasRoN1, and which, in the early stage of the investigation,
appeared extremely probable, namely, that chemical changes
are the primary causes of the phanomena of GaLvanism.

Before the experiments of M. VoLTa on the electricity
excited by the mere contact of metals were published, I had
to a certain extent adopted this opinion ; but the new facts
immediately proved that another power must necessarily be
concerned ; for it was not possible to refer the electricity
exhibited by the apposition of metallic surfaces to any che-
mical alterations, particularly as the effect is more distinct in
a dry atmosphere, in which even the most oxidable metals do
not change, than in a moist one, in which many metals un-
dergo chemical alteration.

Other facts likewise s0on occurred demonstrative of the
same thing. In the VoLTaic combination of diluted nitrous
acid, zinc and copper, as is well known, the side of the zinc
exposed to the acid is positive. But in combinations of zinc,
