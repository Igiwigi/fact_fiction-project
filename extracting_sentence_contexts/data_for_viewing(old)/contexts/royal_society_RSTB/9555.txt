(a) The potential and challenges of mobile DNA
technologies

The first hours of a crime scene investigation, the so-called
‘golden hours’, are often of crucial importance for the
police to get more information about the identity of potential
suspects and to obtain relevant facts and data. Especially in
high profile cases, the criminal justice system has a strong
