In 1890 VircHow (26) contributed further to the subject, laying stress upon the
replacement of the capillary circulation in the gill-like pseudobranch of the Notidanide
by a system of open continuous loops in the reduced pseudobranch of other sharks,
by which a freer passage is set up between the afferent pseudobranch artery and the
anterior carotid.

He also draws attention to the contortion of both the anterior and posterior carotids

in Carcharias and Lamna, and records for the first time a fact of probably some con-
siderable importance, namely, the marked increase both in the width of the convoluted
vessels and in the thickness of their walls. This, as I have described above, was very
noticeable in both the anterior and posterior carotids of Zamna, and appears to vary
in degree in other sharks according to the amount of contortion of the vessels.

Vircuow also makes the statement that convolution is restricted not to particular
vessels, but to all the vessels within a certain area, becoming less marked as the limits of
this area are approached. This to some extent is true. Convolution is strongest and
most pronounced upon vessels within the space between the cranium, palato-quadrate
and eyeball, but does not affect all vessels within this area, being confined, except rarely
(cf. Alopecias), to the main trunks of the vessels without involving the branches of
distribution.
