I found, however,
that no matter how small a portion of this organ I used, and no matter from what part,
of the organ I cut it, this portion would do its best to bend over to the side which I
irritated, Similarly, no matter how short a stump of the polypite I left in connexion
with the nectocalyx, on irritating any part of the latter, the stump of the polypite
would deflect itself towards that part of the bell, although of course, from its short
length, it was unable to reach it. Hence there can be no doubt that every portion of
the polypite—down, at least, to the size which is compatible with conducting these
experiments—is independently endowed with the capacity of very precisely localizing a
point of irritation which is seated either in its own swbstance or in that of the bell *. We have here, then, a curious fact, and one which it will be well to bear in mind
during our subsequent endeayours to frame some sort of a conception regarding the
nature of these primitive nervous tissues. ' The localizing function which is s0 very
efficiently performed by the polypite of this Medusa, and which, if any thing resembling
it occurred in the higher animals, would certainly have definite ganglionic centres for
its structural correlative, is here shared equally by every part of the exceedingly tenuous
contractile tisxue that forms the outer surface of the organ.
