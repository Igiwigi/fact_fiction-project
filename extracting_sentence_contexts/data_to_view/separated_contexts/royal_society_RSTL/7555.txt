J. TL. CLARKE ON THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN. 285

(28) This intimate connexion of the sensory division of the fifth nerye with the vagus

- and glossopharyngeal nerves in the grey tubercle, as well as the connexion, just shown.
| of its motor nucleus with the glossopharyngeal nucleus, with the returning fibres of i
t glossopharyngeal nerve, and with the © fasciculus teres,” are facts of uncommon interest.
| 1-(29) The longitudinal fibres (V V', fig. 8, Plate VIIL.) immediately in front, and on
\ the outer side, of the hypoglossal nucleus (2') have the same kind of anatomical con-
| nexion with that nucleus as the antero-lateral white columns of the spinal cord have
with its anterior horn. In longitudinal sections carried through these columns and the

_ hypoglossal nucleus the fibres along the border of the nucleus may be seen to enter
or issue from it, just as the fibres of the antero-lateral columns do along the border
Hof the grey substance in the cord. It has been seen that along the line Lf, from the
Agpinal-accessory nucleus outward, the longitudinal bundles between N and » are paring
Sand wide apart (ﬆe 9”, fig. 27, Plate X.).
