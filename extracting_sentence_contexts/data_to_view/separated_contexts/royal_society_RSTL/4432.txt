The electro-chemical theory has defined more exactly in what this
affinity consists, and states that the two particles are to one another in a positive and
negative electric relation. But I do not know that it has ever been pointed out that this
chemical relation—this affinity between the particles of a substance—is an essential
condition of the decomposition as well as of the composition of the body. As I am
about to infer a chemical difference between the particles of the element from the
fact of their chemical separation, I must say a few words upon this point, and I shall
Simplify the whole question by stating briefly the mode in which I consider chemical
change to be effected. I may do this sufficiently for my present purpose in the fol-
lowing propositions :—

1. That when two particles chemically combine, a certain chemical relation exists
between them which is expressed by the terms positive and negative.
