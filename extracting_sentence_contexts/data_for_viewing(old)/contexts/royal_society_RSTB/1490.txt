and Semon obtained it. Further, the area for acceleration of respiration is that
situated nearest to the focus on the prorean gyrus from which I obtained abduction
of the vocal cords ; whereas the proximity of Spencer’s chief focus for the arrest of
respiration makes it possible for an effect obtained from Horstey and SEmon’s
abductor centre to be in reality due sometimes to spread of the current to the
arrest centre, and, apart from this, the focus for abduction as indicated by these
observers comes within the peripheral limits of the arrest area as defined by SPENCER,
and comparable to the other focus within SpeNceR’s area of arrest of respiration
from which arrest of the cords in adduction can be obtained, rather than a centre for
abduction comparable to that for adduction which they found on the coronal gyrus
in the cat.

The fact that I have obtained evidence of the existence of a focus in the cerebral
cortex of the dog, excitation of which results in abduction of the vocal cords, is at
variance with the results obtained by Horsiry and Semon in this animal, for they
were unable to find any evidence of the existence of such a focus. That this should
have been their experience is in no way surprising, for I feel sure that but for the
preliminary procedure of dividing the adductor fibres in one recurrent laryngeal
nerve before exciting the cortex, which enabled me to find the first indications of the
existence of such a focus, my conclusion would have been the same as theirs. It was
only after I had divided the adductor fibres in one or both recurrent laryngeal nerves
that I was able to evoke the movement of abduction of the vocal cords, by stimu-
lating the particular focus on the prorean gyrus. This, of course, led me to test the
excitability of this portion of the cortex with still greater care, in all stages of ether
narcosis, even in animals whose recurrent laryngeal nerves were both intact, with the
