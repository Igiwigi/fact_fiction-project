the former animal for the preliminary investigation of the accuracy of the general
position which is involved in our first statements. But we also found in the Cat that,
while with a given strength of excitation, stimulation of the lower limb cortical area
ve the definite result of a movement of two divisions in the electrometer (the con-
Gection of the cord, &., being as stated before), the excitation of the occipital lobe
and the temporo-sphenoidal lobe respectively gave no result at all. Upon this point
may be remarked that in some instances we were able in the Cat even to differen-
ate, as we easily could do in the Monkey, between the upper limb and the lower
mb areas. That is to say, that if the dorsal cord were observed, we got a well-
farked effect by exciting the lower limb focus (as indicated by FrrRimr), whereas
Recitation of the fore limb focus produced no visible change in ‘the cord’s state, as
pvidenced by the electrometer.
Thus the following facts were noted in the Cat (126).
