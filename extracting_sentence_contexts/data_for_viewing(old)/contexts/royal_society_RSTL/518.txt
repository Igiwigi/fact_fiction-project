When therefore the component parts of shell and bone are
considered, it appears that the essential characteristics are, car-
bonate of lime for the one, and phosphate of lime for the other;
and that their bases consist of the modifications of a glutinous,
gelatinous, or membranaceous substance.

I experienced much gratification in tracing the progressive
and connected changes in the composition of the various shells
and bones ; and a considerable increase of pleasure arose, in pro-
portion as the observations made on those bodies were corrobo-
rated, and the chain of connection extended, by the develope-
ment of the facts resulting from the experiments on Zoophytes,
which form the principal subject of this paper.

It will now be proper to review these: experiments, and to
examine how far they agree with those made on shell and bone,
| and how far they tend to prove, that these substances are all of
a nature closely connected.

The experiments on the Madrepores afforded the following
results.

Madrepora virginea, when examined by acids, left but very
little of any gelatinous substance or membrane.
