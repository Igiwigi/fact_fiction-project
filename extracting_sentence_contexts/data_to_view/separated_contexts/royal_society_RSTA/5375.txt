However, this being the case ILES should, as
LES, become problematic near walls where at high Reynolds number grid
resolution demands are severe. Hence it seems unclear why the LES community
has invested substantial research effort into hybridization with near-wall RANS
modelling and the ILES community has not considered this technique. There
seems three possible reasons for the success of pure ILES for wall bounded flows:

—some ILES are akin to wall resolved LES, i.e. they are quasi-direct numerical
simulation (DNS) near walls (Drikakis et al. 2009);

—some form of wall modelling is used, such as log-wall functions, but the use
and justification of the actual ILES approach detracts attention from the fact
that there is wall treatment (Fureby 2009); and

—some flows considered are more ‘top-down’ than ‘bottom-up’. By the former, it is meant that turbulent structures external to the wall region
are strongly convected into the boundary layer. The structures overwhelm the
classical boundary-layer physics.
