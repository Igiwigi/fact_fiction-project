(without stimulation) ranges from approximately 300 to 700 ml dâ„¢! [3]. Sebum is an oily substance
mostly composed of lipids. In fact, different compounds present on the skin surface have diverse
distributions (influenced by skin cells, microbes and daily routines) [103]. The main function of
sweating is to protect the human body from overheating. Skin excretions (including sweat) also
moisturize the skin, and protect it from evaporation of water.
