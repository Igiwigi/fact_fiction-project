It may be as well to notice that the equations (@.), (6.), (c.) are solved by auxiliary arcs

as follows:
As8ume
tan 1,= tan pAy, tan 1,= tan «Ap,
then
=> @W, =Ng—N1 o wg =1n +1
S It is needless to remark that Jacos1's transformation does not enable us to reduce

2 the integral of the circular form. 'The difficulty which we here encounter, is exactly
S analogous to that which presents itself in the reduction of the cubic equation of ordinary
S algebra. In fact, if we were to apply Jacos1's transformation to one only of & or ©, the
© auxiliary arcs just mentioned would give values of » of the form q+1'\/ —1), and the
= difficulty would depend upon the interpretation of F(y+a'x/ —1).
