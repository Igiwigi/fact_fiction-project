If this
is the case, flights that are highly convoluted and extrem-
ely inefficient (e.g. bird 2, figures 4 and 5) could be
interpreted as the individual being exploratory, rather than
being ‘lost’, and potentially unrelated to their laboratory-
based neophobia and SEF behaviour from the loft. If this
was the case, those individuals are exhibiting latent learning
and building up a detailed mosaic map for future use. The fact that they made it home eventually demonstrates
the desire and motivation to home, and hence deviations
could indeed be interpreted as exploratory and ‘intentional’,
termed ‘exploration refinement’ by Guilford et al. [54]. How-
ever, the long periods of time that the birds spent perched as
opposed to in active flight would suggest this is an unlikely
explanation.

(c) Future directions

It is established that individual variation in personality can
have fitness consequences [55], with, for example, personality
dictating overwinter survival in female red squirrels (Tamias-
ciurus hudsonicus) [55] and reproductive fitness in fish [56],
birds [57] and mammals [58]. Similarly, Santos et al. [59]
demonstrated that laboratory assays of homing pigeons’
boldness behaviour could predict an individual’s likelihood
to be predated by raptors.
