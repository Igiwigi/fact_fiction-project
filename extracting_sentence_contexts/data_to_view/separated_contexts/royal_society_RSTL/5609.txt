II is a seminyariant * reduced to zero by the operation

* The term © Seminyariant” js due to Mr. Carrey, who in a letter to me dated March 22, 1560, 8ays,
«The meaning is a function which is reduced to zero by one only of the operators which reduce to zero
an invariant. It is in fact the leading coefficient of a covariant. Tt may also be defined as a function of
the coefficients which is not altered by the substitution of #+7 for x.” Defined as functions of the coelſi-
