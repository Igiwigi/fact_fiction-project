The diphasic variation SN (viz., apex negativity followed by base negativity) is,
in consequence of injury of the apex, converted into the monophasic variation N
(unbalanced negativity of base). After a time the diphasic variation SN re-appears,
and now it is converted into the monophasic variation S (unbalanced negativity of
apex) in consequence of injury of the apex. These facts, illustrated in fig. 1, are
precisely similar to those observed by Burpon SanpErson and Pacer * upon the
ventricle of the Frog and Tortoise, the only difference being in the nature of the
normal variation antecedent to injury.
