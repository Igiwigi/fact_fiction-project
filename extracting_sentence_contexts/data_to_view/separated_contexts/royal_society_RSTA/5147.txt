g a 59. When a charged body moves relatively to the surrounding zther, with a
_ velocity small compared with the velocity of electric propagation, it practically
| carries its electric displacement-system (jf, g, /) along with it in an equilibrium
configuration. Thus the displacement at any point fixed in the ether will change,
aud we shall virtually have the field filled with electric currents which are completed
in the lines of motion of the charged elements of the body, so Jong as that motion
continues, On this view, Maxwe t's convection-current is not differentiated from
onduction-current in any manner whatever, if we except the fact that viscous decay
ally accompanies the latter. A metallically coated glass disc, rotating in its own plane without altering its
osition in space, would on this theory produce no convection-current at all; but if
he coating of the disc is divided into isolated parts by scratches, as in RowLanp and

764 MR. J. LARMOR ON A DYNAMICAL THEORY OF

Hurcnrsonâ€™s experiments,* or even if there is a single line of division, each portic
will carry its field of electric displacement along with it, the field preserving
statical configuration under all realizable speeds of rotation. If the scratches did n,
run up to the centre of the disc, the field of displacement due to the central part
would be quiescent, and the displacement-currents would be altered in chara
The dielectric displacement in the experiments above-mentioned, with two paralle
rotating gilt glass condenser-dises having radial scratches, is across the field from on
disc to the other, and is steady throughout the motion; so that the convection-
currents are completely represented by the simple convection of the electric charge
on the discs, and are not spread over the dielectric field.
