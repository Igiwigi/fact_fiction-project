The first part of the present paper is devoted to establishing a complete system for five
quadratics which, in the second part of the paper, is shown to be irreducible. The reductions
are based on the classification of possible forms given by Turnbull, and in order to make the
account self-contained there is a certain amount of overlapping with Turnbull’s original
paper. This overlapping is essential if the present paper is to be intelligible at all, since many
of Turnbull’s reductions are not pressed far enough, and an account which begins every

‘discussion at the point where Turnbull breaks it off would, in the present case, be too dis-
jointed to follow.

The reductions are effected by using the familiar identities of symbolic algebra. The length
of the discussion is due, in part, to the large number of forms which arise for consideration,
and also to the fact that, for a comparatively few forms, the actual reductions themselves
are of considerable length. It is necessary, particularly in the more complicated cases, to
give the work in detail, since the processes involved are by no means obvious.
