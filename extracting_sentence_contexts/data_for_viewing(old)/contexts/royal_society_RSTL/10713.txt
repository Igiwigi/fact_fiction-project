concerned.* We might, perhaps, be inclined to infer that, because the internal -
friction is independent of the load, 80 also will be the torsional elasticity, but my own
experience had taught me that it was by no means safe to do 80. Tt is true that,
Experiments VIII. and IX. had shown that the torsional elasticity must be nearly =
independent of the load when the latter is ab all Jarge, inasmuch as the period of
vibration was nearly the same for all the loads. There were, however, slight
differences in the vibration-period for the different loads, which IT felt inclined to
attribute to the fact that the boxes might nob always hang quite vertically. The
following experiments seem to show conclusively that for loads ranging from moderate
amounts to great ones the period of yibration is independent of the load.

LPxperiment XII.

A pan made of brass was suspended by two hooks, H, H (fig. 3); the bottom of the
pan was circular, and the two suspenders. H A, H A, made of drawn brass, were
soldered into A. The lead cylinders before-mentioned were in the first instance
placed on the pan, 80 that their centres were in the same line as the axis of the wire.
The brass cylinders, C,, were placed near the ends of the bax V Y, at equal distances
from the wire, and had in consequence of their position and mass a very considerable
moment of inertia as compared with the rest of the vibrator. After the arrangements
