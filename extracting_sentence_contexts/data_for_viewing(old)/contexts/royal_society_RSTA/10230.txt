in centimetres per second, p the: instantaneous pressure in tons per square inch, and a
an empirical constant equal to about 3째5) may be of use where it is not possible to make
a direct experimental determination.

The maximum pressure (P) developed by a given charge is usually well known, and
by aid of the above formula the curve of rise of pressure can therefore be obtained
The radius of the cordite for successive intervals of pressure (p = 0째1P, p = 0:2 P,
&c.) is first computed, and the time required to burn through the corresponding
distance at the average pressure (p = 0째5 P, p = 0째15 P, &c.) is then determined. In
calculating the radius, the volume of the unburnt explosive must, of course, be taken
into account, and this renders the work somewhat tedious.

The formula does not take into account the fact that under experimental conditions
some time elapses while the flame is spreading before the normal rate of combustion is
set up. The zero of the calculated curve is, therefore, shifted somewhat to the right,
and a sharper slope given to the initial stage (a, fig. 10).

It may with some truth be argued that the error occurring at a very low pressure
would not affect the results as applied to ballistics, the calculation and experimental
curves being in agreement by the time the motion of the shot commences. It is
hoped, however, that the day is not far distant when we shall be able to obtain an
indicator card from a gun with the same ease as we now indicate other heat engines ;
approximate calculations such as the above will then cease to be of practical value.

We have explained above the system used for firing the charge. When the key
