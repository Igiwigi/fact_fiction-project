KOROSI ON AN ESTIMATE OF THE DEGREES OF LEGITIMATE

Besides this, the thesis needs not only to be justified by still more and numerous
observations of other countries, but requires also to be corrected by the circumstance
that greatest fecundity is not equal to greatest health of the children. As for this
latter point I had occasion to make observations on the influence of the parental age
on the mortality of children. The results which I obtained in this enquiry seem to
advocate deferring the time of marrying one year beyond the limits mentioned
before.*

Let us finally enquire in what degree the observed facts correspond with the conse-
quences deduced from the statistics of the age differences. We find in our table of
natality the following figures for the couples between the quoted limits of age and for
the children born in those families in four years :—

Father 24-25 and mother 18, 19, or 20 . . . . . 87 families with 148 births,
» 25-26 ~ az > £0 ak, eee a 262..
» 26-27 <4 43 : ate oe. ee * 346,
Total . 414 5 706 = 45

or yearly 189 births, giving a natality of 45°7 per cent. Looking at the table of natality (rough figurest), we shall see that there are only
two age combinations more (referring to at least 100 families) where the natality is so
high, namely :—

Father of 26 years with mother of 21 years (46°8 per cent.),
and the rs 28 3 Fe ‘3 284 'y, 0 (45:8ia ee):

Thus it seems possible that an enquiry established on a larger scale would perhaps
extend the limit of the most suitable age for the bridegroom and for the bride by
2-3 years.
