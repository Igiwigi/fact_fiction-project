high spatial accuracy. Low dispersion errors and low numerical damping in propagating waves
are then achieved, compared with a lower order FVM or finite difference method. Waves can
therefore be generated and propagated towards the structure with high accuracy in a numerical
wave tank (NWT). Furthermore, the far-field waves generated by the structure can be described
with high accuracy.

The following limitations apply in the developed code: (i) the body geometry must fit on
a rectangular mesh, (ii) vorticity should not reach the free surface, and (iii) turbulence is not
accounted for. The importance of turbulence depends on the problem being considered. For
instance, it is crucial in determining the flow separation points for bodies without sharp corners
in super- and transcritical flow conditions. Even though free vorticity flow becomes turbulent at
much lower Reynolds numbers than for boundary layer flow, turbulence modelling is believed
to be secondary when flow separation from a sharp corner occurs. However, the fact that
turbulent diffusion of free vorticity flow is much larger than viscous diffusion does have an
effect, in particular in ambient oscillatory flow. We are not aware of quantitative investigations
of the latter effect with relevance to our problem. Turbulent flow modelling would require a
three-dimensional model.

Using the present hybrid method instead of using the Navier-Stokes equation with a state-of-
the-art numerical scheme in the whole liquid domain is significantly more time efficient.
