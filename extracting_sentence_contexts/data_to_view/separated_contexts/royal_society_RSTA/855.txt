This is the grand goal for theoretical physics. We do not expect a single good
measure; macroscopic quantumness has many facets, indeed. But there is a need for structuring
these facts and combining the macro side with the quantum side in relevant figures of merit. There is already some literature on this, but quite disconnected from experiments. There are
also some experiments, like those mentioned above and even more, but usually disconnected
from abstract theoretical concepts.
