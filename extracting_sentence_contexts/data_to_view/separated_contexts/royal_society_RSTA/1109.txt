In more detail, the components Si, S; and U are defined as the space-time
decomposition (4.2) of the energy-stress tensor 7,â€™ that appears in equation (3.1). Also, we have
introduced the definition of the so called transport velocity as di := (vu! + B')/a. Finally, we stress
that due to the fact that system (3.1) is overdetermined, see (3.2), we are free to chose whether the
total energy or entropy equation is discretized (we chose to discretize the energy equation). The
remaining quantity is computed from the equation of state. Finally, for the static spacetimes,
the Cowling approximation [72]

aSiKi = 55" Bl aivik + Sla;Bi, (4.7)

can be used for the extrinsic curvature Kj; [3] in (4.6c).

(b) Numerical examples

(i) Heat conduction

Here, we solve a simple Riemann problem that involves heat conduction.
