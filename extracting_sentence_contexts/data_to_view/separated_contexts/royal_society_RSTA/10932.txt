Unless, therefore, the
results of M. Le Roux were inaccurate, it appeared that no simple generalisation
could be made which would embrace all the elements whose indices were known,
But the coincidences exhibited by the halogens and the inert gases were so striking
as to induce me to attempt to repeat the work of the French physicist, and to verify
his conclusions. In this desire I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux
himself speaks of the accuracy of his results with diffidence, owing to the great
difficulties involved in the experimental method he employed. The earliest researches on the indices of the permanent gases were made with a
hollow prism, but this was afterwards abandoned for the more accurate method of
interference bands.
