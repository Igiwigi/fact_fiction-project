corpuscles observed in this row, presented indications of division into corpuscles of
minuter $ize.

66. We thus find blood-vessels, the walls of which consist of filaments, having the
same structure as those filaments which the blood-corpuscle forms. In connection
with the spiral direction of the outer filament in these vessels (fig. 16 B), as well in-
deed as with many facts recorded in this memoir, I refer to the rouleaur in which
the blood-corpuscles are seen in the microscope to arrange theiselves, as probably
indicating a tendency to produce spiral filaments. To form rouleauz, corpuscle joins
itself to corpuscle, that is to say, ring to ring, and rings, as we have seen (par. 34),
pass into coils. The union of snch coils, end to end, would form a spiral, But the
formation, by the blood-corpuscles, of these rouleaur, is no less interesting in con-
nection with facts recorded in a former memoir ; namely, that structures, including
blood-vessels, may be seen to have their origin in rows of cells derived from corpus-
cles of the blood.

67. I have noticed very curious resemblances in mould, arising from the decay of
