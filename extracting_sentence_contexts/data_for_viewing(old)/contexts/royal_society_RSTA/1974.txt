With Maxwell the scientific imagination was everything: Stokes carried caution to excess.
Maxwell revelled in the construction and dissection of mental and material models and
images of the activities of the molecules which form the basis of matter: Stokes’ published
investigations are mainly of the precise and formal kind, guided by the properties and
symmetries of matter in bulk, in which the notion of a molecule need hardly enter.

But it has turned out, over the intervening century, that understanding both molecules and
‘investigations --- of the precise and formal kind’ on the ‘properties and symmetries of matter
in bulk’ is required to make progress in many areas of physics.

The history linking continuum and discrete aspects of the question at hand is convoluted and
interesting. In 1834 Russell observed solitary water waves [2]. Stokes proposed in 1847 that what
Russell had observed were in fact periodic wave trains in a nonlinear system [3]. Benjamin and
Feir demonstrated in 1967 that these Stokes waves could become unstable [4]. Lake et al. showed
in 1977 that under certain circumstances the so-called Benjamin-Feir instability may lead to a
Fermi—Pasta—Ulam—Tsingou-type recurrence [5]. Meanwhile an approximate theory for a solitary
wave was given by Boussinesq in 1871 [6] and Rayleigh in 1876 [7]. In 1895, Korteweg and de Vries
derived a full nonlinear theory [8]. In 1965, Zabusky and Kruskal noted that the Korteweg-de


Vries equation, the integrable continuum limit of the discrete Fermi-Pasta-Ulam—Tsingou system,
possesses soliton solutions [9].
