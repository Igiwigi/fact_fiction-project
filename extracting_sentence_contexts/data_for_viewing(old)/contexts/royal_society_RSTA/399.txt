to equation (3.4), it can therefore be concluded that the edge SNR is maximized, for a fixed beam
intensity Ip incident on the object, at an illumination fraction slightly lower than 50%.

However, if the intensity on the detector is kept fixed rather than the intensity on the object,
the edge SNR is maximized at a different position of the detector edge. In fact, noting that
Trop = C+. (Yedge)lo, equation (3.4) can be rewritten as

A plot of the quantity C’, /C; is presented in figure 2d. It shows that the maximum of this function
is reached for a misalignment of about 10 1m from the centre of the beam, corresponding to a very
low pixel illumination fraction, about 8%.

The radiation dose to the sample is proportional to the intensity incident on it. Therefore, if
in a given experimental set-up the dose needs to be minimized (as is often the case for biological
samples), the SNR optimization should be done by considering Ip fixed, thus resulting in the
