It was only when the liquid was evaporated to dryness that a change took place; but
then the change was no longer due to the action of the potassa, but to the influence
of heat, and in no way differed from the decomposition which the crystals undergo
when heated alone. The deportment with potassa of the new iodine-compound altogether precludes the
idea of considering it as an analogue of the hydriodides of ethylamine, diethylamine,
and triethylamine, all of which are readily decomposed under the influence of the
alkalies. However, the iodine, though it cannot be eliminated from the crystals by the
alkalies, may be separated with the greatest facility by silver-salts ; in fact, the nitrate,
the sulphate, the oxide of silver, behave with the iodine-compound exactly as with
iodide of potassium or sodium. On adding nitrate of silver to a solution of the iodide,
iodide of silyer is at once precipitated and a nitrate remains in solution, which on
evaporation crystallizes in deliquescent needles. With sulphate of silver, a perfectly
similar change takes place, an analogous suIpbate remaining in solution.
