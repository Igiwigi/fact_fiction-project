This gale was felt between
the 48th and goth degrees of latitude, and, no doubt, ex-
tended its effects very far to the south and west ; but what
the state of the winds had been in those quarters, previous to
the 27th of January, we are ignorant. The winds in the Bri-
tish Channel had been easterly, for three days preceding the
gale: the fourth day, preceding, there had been strong gales
at SW ; and the five days preceding that, there had been
chiefly light winds at west. According to this state of facts,
we can only suppose that the current originated from a vast
body of water, pent up in the Bay of Biscay, by violent gales
of wind ; first from the southward, eleven hours; then from
a point or two to the south of west ; and lastly, at south-west. * Cape Clear is reckoned to be in long. 99 25' from London.
