In fact,
there is hardly any tide observable between the Hoorn reef and the entrance
of the Sleeve.”

'The 7* tide line on the Ower shoal is further back than the same line on the
$hore; which, being contrary to the course of single tides, appears to indicate 5
there a tide of interference ; the absence of tide on the coast of Jutland is also k
probably the result of interference, for the tides at Heligoland are said to rise |
9 feet (Nozs). If we suppose the southern and northern tides to reach this
space at an interyal of 6 hours, —for instance, if the tide-hours for these tides |
be respectiyely 3) and 9,—the tide will be altogether obliterated by their com-

bination. We may therefore account for seyeral of the facts, by supposing the 9 tide-
line to advance from the north in a convex form, 80 as to approach this part ;
and the southern tide to move 80 as to produce the lines 12", 1, 2b, 3b on the
coast of Denmark, if it were single. We may thus suppose in the middle of the
ocean @ space which has its tide at 6" nearly, by the interference of the tides
at 4b 5h 6b
