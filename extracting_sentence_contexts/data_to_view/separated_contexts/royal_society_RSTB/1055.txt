The next stage seen is represented in figs. 107 and 108, where immediately below the
epiblast are two elongated cells lying next to the two nucleated protoplasmic masses,
which are continuous with the yolk. The two protoplasmic bodies are the essential
parts of the two yolk-cells, and the two cells beneath are the first mesoblastic cells
which have been cut off from them, This is seen from the facts that their outer
boundaries are continuous with the contour of the yolk: the two cells are not
coextensive with cells of the epiblast, at their junction with the latter, but are, on
the contrary, coextensive with the yolk-cells, the nuclei of which may sometimes be
seen dividing : they are also of a different character to the epiblast cells, inasmuch
as they often contain yolk granules and oil drops, undigested remnants inherited from
the yolk, and consequently the staining is less deep. The growth of the protoplasm of the yolk-cells at the expense of the yolk con-
tinues, and the two nuclei with their surrounding protoplasm pass forwards; new
mesoblast cells are cut off from the two yolk-cells, while the earlier ones divide longi-
tudinally and transversely (figs. 109 to 111).
