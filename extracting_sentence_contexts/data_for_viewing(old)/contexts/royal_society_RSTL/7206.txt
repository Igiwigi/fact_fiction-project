both these investigations will supplement each other. By the kindness of Admiral
FirzRor I am able to compare the instruments which are used by the British Navy with
my chemical analyses, and thus to obtain a comparison between both geries.

I have at different times found an opportunity to publish several parts of my obser-

treatise in the Danish language*. Since that time I have obtained numerous samples
of sea-water, principally from places which my previous examination had not reached.
In this new form, and greatly augmented by new facts, I permit myself to lay it before
the illustrious scientific society of a nation to whose navigators I owe 80 great a part of
the material for my inquiries, This part contains an enumeration of the elements which
