from above, the fibres of the superior commissure are found to spread out into a delicate
layer roofing in the ventricles quite to the anterior part of the hemisphere, as described
in the Kangaroo.

Having described the actual condition of an important and well-marked region of the
cerebrum in several members of the two great groups of the Mammalia, it now remains
to trace out the relation that the several structures entering into the formation of this
region bear to one another in each of the two groups. It will be necessary also to
inquire how far the results brought out by the present method of examination are in
accordance with the views generally received.

At the outset a distinct confirmation is afforded by the dissections recorded in this
paper, of the great fact, first observed by Professor OwEx, that the brains of animals of
the orders Marsupialia and Monotremata present certain special and peculiar characters,
by which they may be at once distinguished from those of other mammals. 'The appear-
ance of either a transverse or longitudinal section would leave no doubt whatever as to
which group the brain belonged. In the differentiating characters to be enumerated,
80me members of the higher section present a considerable approximation to the lower ;
but, as far as is known at present, there is still an interval between them unconnected
by any intermediate link.

The differences are manifold, but all have a certain relation to, and even a partial
dependence on, each other.

They may be enumerated under the following heads :â€”
