the ordinary form of sporidium of Spheria lanciformis, and & and d are exactly the
fruit of Zendersonia polyeystis minus the gelatinous border. The absence of the latter
is easily accounted for, since all sporidia which have gelatinous envelopes lose them in
process of time, and the specimens in which these different forms were found were
unfortunately s0 far past their prime that the perithecia were almost empty. This latter
cireumstance may perhaps be considered as throwing some doubt upon the observation,
and it certainly would have been more satisfactory to have found the Spheeria and
Hendersonia in full fruit in the same stroma ; but if the facts T have stated be not con-
sidered sufficient to establish the identity of the two plants, they must, T think, be
admitted to afford reasonable grounds for a suspicion of relationship between them. Tf the Hendersonia be an imperfect form of the Sphzeria, then the 80-called perithecia
and fruit of the former will be (to adopt M. TuLasxE's terminology) the pycnidia and
stylospores of the Sphzeria. In the last vol.
