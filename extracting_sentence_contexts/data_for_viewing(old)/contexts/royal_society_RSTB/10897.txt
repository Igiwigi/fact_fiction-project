will exist. If we exclude the extreme values, we obtain qualitat-
ively similar results (median (absolute) r = 0.09, 28 out of 110
correlations statistically significant at p = 0.05).

The top five correlations in terms of (absolute) strength
were: CO, production in 2010, Oil use in 2011, Chocolate con-
sumption in 2004, Military spending (% GDP) in 2013, and
Population aged between 15 and 64 in 2013. However, exclu-
sion of extreme values (3*IQR rule) gives a rather different
top 5: Chocolate consumption in 2004, Contraception preva-
lence in 2010, Research & development expenditure in 2010,
the % of malnutrition in 2010, and the % of teenage mothers
in 2012. The fact that this top five looks quite different,
points to the importance of outliers in ASR and exemplifies
how volatile these statistical relationships are. For example,
Military spending, ranked fourth without exclusion of
extreme values, is now ranked 98th in terms of strength
when excluding extreme values.

We repeated this exercise at US state level (see figure 4). The
median (absolute) correlation with sex ratio was 0.22. Seven-
teen out of 50 correlations with sex ratio were statistically
significant (34%). The top five correlations in terms of (absol-
ute) strength were: Date of statehood, the Gini Coefficient
(2010), mean travel time to work (2009-2013), the maximum
