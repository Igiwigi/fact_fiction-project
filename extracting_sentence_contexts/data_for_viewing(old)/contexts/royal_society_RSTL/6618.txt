There seems to be a distinction between the law of mortality and that of sickness,
inasmuch as 9, in the law of mortality, is a poxitive fraction less than unity,
the similar term B in the law of sickness is greater than unity,

Art. 29. Here I must dra the reader's very particular attention to the formula

SL=CE+Ef+k—M,+pr, where 2M,=#.7=h.q-,
where for analytical anticipation it is put in the form
Li =00 + hp *+he**—My,,+wt*;

and the two portions &z"** and py"** are developed into series proceeding by the powers
of x, because those series for several of the first terms, when x is at, all large, are 80
divergent that in that case they become of no practical service; and in fact, though, if a
sufficient number of terms be used, they are ultimately convergent and would lead to
the true yalue, they present 80 formidable an obstacle as to cause, if those series be used,
a complete refusal of the aid which was expected from them to render the formula
analytically anticipatory, at least at those periods when these functions haye a prevailing
influence oyer anticipation ; and if this difficulty had not been overcome by the adoption
of a subterfuge, which I almost despaired of finding, a great part of the highly im-
portant analytically anticipating powers of the formula would be destroyed. The series
alluded to are exhibited as follows ;—
