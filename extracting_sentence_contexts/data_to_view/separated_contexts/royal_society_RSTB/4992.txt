The basal portion of each pleuroccipital cartilage,
immediately ventral to the posterior boundary of the foramen jugulare, is perforated

by three foramina, serially arranged in an antero-posterior direction, through which
emerge the roots of Nerve XII. The fact that at Stage P there are four foramina,
transmitting five nerve roots, has already been noted. In Stage 8 the condition
observed is the same as in Stage R, but in adult Sphenodon two foramina only have
been found by Howes and Swinnerton (1901). On the ventral surface of the parachordal cartilage there is, in this region, a decided
thickening and incipient ossification, which extends outwards from a single centre
and is evidently the developing medio-ventral basioccipital bone.
