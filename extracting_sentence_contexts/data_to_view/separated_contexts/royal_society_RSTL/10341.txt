The only other grasses in any fair amount with the
Sammonia-salts were Avena flavescens and Holeus lanatus; whereas, without the
Smmonia, besides these two, Alopecurus pratensis, Avena pubescens, A. elatior, and
edgrostis vulgaris, were also in fair quantity. In other words, with the ammonia-salts,
A few individual grasses attained greater prominence, and the rest were more meagrely
epresented than without them. Woe have, in fact, with the ammonia, the constantly
Sgbserved result of increased vegetative luxuriance. S Leguminous species were, under the influence of the dung and ammonia-salts
<together, almost banished ; Lathyrus pratensis, however, retaining the first place. Of miscellaneous species, there were in 1862 only four on plot 1 with the ammonia-
Ralts which contributed as much as 1 per cent., whilsb there were five on plot 2 without
them.
