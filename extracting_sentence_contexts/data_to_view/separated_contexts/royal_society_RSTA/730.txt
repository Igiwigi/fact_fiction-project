Along the
front edge of the panel is arranged a bank of telephone keys, controlling the various
circuits. Fig. 9 shows diagrammatically the arrangement of the circuits and, as far
as is consistent with the limitations of the drawing, those leads which are in fact
twisted closely together are shown side by side. The internal circuits of S and of
the zero adjuster are, for simplicity, shown purely formally in this figure. The whole assembly is immersed in a stoneware tank containing transformer oil,
so that all the inductive coils and resistances are protected from the atmosphere
and are maintained at a uniform temperature.
