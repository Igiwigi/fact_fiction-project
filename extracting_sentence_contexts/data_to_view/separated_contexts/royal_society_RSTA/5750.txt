where i, j,k denote gauge group indices, with fi the gauge group structure constants. In our four-dimensional cosmology [43-46], we shall not cancel the anomalies. In fact, we shall
assume that only fields of the bosonic degrees of freedom of the massless gravitational string
multiplet appear as external fields in the effective action describing the dynamics of the early
Universe. Chiral fermionic and gauge matter are generated at the end of the inflationary period
as we shall discuss later on, in §4. With the above assumptions, one may implement the Bianchi
identity (2.5) as a constraint in a path-integral, via a pseudoscalar (axion-like) Lagrange multiplier
field b(x).
