they are swrounded, can, when in action, fail by their friction to urge the two extremi-
ties onwards in opposite directions, whilst at the same time the fibres by which these
entozoa are covered are in consequence of their direction preventing the separated ends
from regaining their former position, and thus the two ends being always carried in
opposite directions without the possibility of a counter movement, a general elongation
must ensne. This apparatus also, by splitting up the primary fasciculi, will serve a loco-
motive purpose, and thus enable these animals to reach the cellular intervals between
the muscular fibres, where their further development will be completed. That such is
the effect of the fibres in question is evident on a careful inspection of some of the fas-
ciculi in which these animalcules are contained, in which a separation of the fibrille can
be seen to have been produced by the pointed ends of the entozoon ; these fibrille
having been obviously turned out of their original course, and some directed to one side
and some to the other. This explanation receives confirmation from the fact of those
Cysticerci which are developed in the muscular parietes of the heart being of a different
shape from those formed elsewhere, although their structure in all other respects is
precisely the 8ame. These Cysticerci, in the first or vermicular stage of their develop-

ment, are yery short and thick, and of an oval shape. Their locomotive fibres, though
perfectly demonstrable, are very short, and in many instances imperfect. See Plate X;
fig. 15.

This difference might have been anticipated, considering the close texture of the mus-
