temperature for assimilation, according to the length of time which was allowed to
elapse before readings were taken,

Section V.—SuMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.

i. Reeapitulation.

Let us now recall the evidence at our disposal on the question of the relation
between temperature and assimilation. In the first place we have the series of
curves in figs. 2 and 8 (Section III.), These curves are all of the same type; they
show an initial rising portion, changing abruptly into a level line. The greater the
intensity of the light, the higher up in the temperature-scale does this change in
form occur.. The steeply rising portion of the curve is an expression of the fact
that, at the temperatures concerned, the intensity of the light is sufficient for
maximal assimilation, the long level portion merely gives the amount of CO, the
light employed was capable of decomposing. From these curves we have obtained
the maximal assimilation from —6° C., where the assimilation begins, to +11° C.

We next consider the evidence given by the curve in fig. 4, embodying the results
of the experiments in Section IV. (ii.). This is again a curve of the same type as the
earlier ones and shows the insufficiency of the eightfold light for maximal assimila-
tion in the middle part of the temperature range. The decided fall at the very
high temperatures was a new feature. As each number employed in the curve is
the mean of two separate experiments, this steep fall is well established.
