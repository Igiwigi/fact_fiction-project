But, as in the duck in early stages of development of the
barbs, a point may be seen projecting from the side opposite the apex of the ridge,
which is attached to cytoplasmic strands, as though intermediate cells have lately
been drawn into the barb. There are very few medullary cells in these barbs, the
central spaces rarely being divided. 158 A. HOSKER

The chief difference in the development of protoptiles in ducks and fowls lies in
the fact that the former have a well developed rhachis and hyporhachis, while the
latter have a very short rhachis, and therefore fusion of barbs does not occur until
late stages of development (about the 19th day). Consequently, for a considerable
distance from the tip of the feather, the uniform barbs (of which only about three
in shaft and aftershaft are slightly larger than the rest) are crowded indiscriminately
into the space vacated by the pulp just before hatching. The calamus is very short
and no caps are formed during the incubation period.
