HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 407

As a final result the evidence would seem conclusive that D() for Au is
29465°18+7, that A = 81d = 113961+31‘5y, and that the satellite separation is
produced by 289,. Summary. It must be confessed that much of the foregoing discussion is of a problematical
nature, and that, in fact, some of the suggestions offered are incompatible with one
another. This is no objection in a preliminary search for general principles, as the
raising of questions is only next in importance to answering them. Nevertheless,
some results appear to be well established and others to have considerable evidence in
their favour.
