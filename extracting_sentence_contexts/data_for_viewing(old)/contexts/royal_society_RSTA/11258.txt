was, however, obtained with a K,SO, jelly and Cu and Fe(CN), indicators.

The making of osmotic pressure apparatus might be improved by depositing the membrane electrolytically
in the walls of the pot, previously charged with a potassium chloride jelly. Current readings would give
a sure indication of the condition of the membrane during and after its formation,

the K region, will find itself forced to drop back. This explanation of the sharpness
of certain margins was advanced by WuetHam (loc. cit.), but bears repetition here.
Tt comes to this—that the boundary will possess stability if the necessary condition
be fulfilled, but not otherwise. As a matter of fact it has been found by experiment
that the colourless SO, ion following the yellow CrO, ion through a jelly tube over-
takes it continuously, so that there is no boundary visible, but only a gradual fading
out of colour. A similar result was got also by following the blue Cu ions with
colourless Zn ions through the tube: again there was no boundary, but the colour

adually faded out. These cases probably illustrate the non-fulfilment of the con-

SHition that the foremost ion must be by nature the faster.
