No thawing took place during the
process. Does not this show plasticity even in very small masses of ice?” I have also been lately informed,
on excellent authority, that in a new work by a most eminent German mineralogist, the plastic character of
ice in masses is aszumed as an admitted fact. In corroboration of what has been aid in the text, I may farther
add, that whilst these sheets are passing through the press, I obserye in the Athenzum (June 20, 1846), an
account of a patent process for moulding solid tin into tubes and other utensils, in the course of which it is
*tated that ** tin under a pressure of about twenty tons to a circular inch, will run according to the law of
fluids.” * See Third Letter on Glaciers, Travels, Appendix, p. 407.
