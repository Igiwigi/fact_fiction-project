Suppose that the earth has a uniform core, of radius ¢ a, electric conductivity «
and magnetic permeability ». The part of the earth above this core is treated as
non-conducting, and of permeability unity, though. in fact, the conductivity of the
oceans is higher than that found for the core (§ 1). 3.3. The daily magnetic variations.—For the periodic component of frequency p,
of the harmonic V,’, the complex ratio 1,’/E,’, at the earth’s surface r= a, on the
assumption that the internal part of the field is due to electromagnetic and magnetic
induction within the earth by the outer field, is given by*
