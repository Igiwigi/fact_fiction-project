Accepted: 12 July 2021 A wealth of theoretical and empirical arguments have suggested that music

triggers emotional responses by resembling the inflections of expressive voca-
lizations, but have done so using low-level acoustic parameters (pitch,

When applied to musical material, we find that these three acoustic manipula-
tions trigger emotional perceptions that are remarkably similar to those
