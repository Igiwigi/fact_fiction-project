0Â°0454 gram nitrogen, only one-ninth of which pre-existed as nitric acid or ammonia.
The total gain of nitrogen in plant and soil was 0:0671 gram, a result which is almost
identical with that found in 1858. He adds, that there is this curious coincidence,
that in both cases it is by the soil, and not by the plant, that the gain has been effected.

In the case of none of the other vegetation experiments in 1859 are the gains or
losses by the soils given, so that the total gain or loss cannot be estimated. Bous-
SINGAULT points out, however, that in 1859, there was about twice as much nitrogen
taken up by a haricot growing in 100 grams of the soil, as by one growing in only
50 grams in 1858. It may be added that haricots took up much more nitrogen in
proportion to a given amount of soil than lupins.

Referring to the main results, BousstNGAULT says the singular fact appears, that
the soil not only gained ammonia and nitrates, but organic matter also, possibly the
remains of living organisms. On careful examination, he has observed that vegetable
earth contains, not only dead organised matter, but living organisms, germs, the
vitality of which is suspended by drying, and re-established under favourable con-
ditions as to moisture and temperature. This mycodermic vegetation is not always
visible to the naked eye, and its progress must be followed by the aid of the micro-
scope. The mycoderms have only an ephemeral existence, and they leave their
detritus in the soil, which in time may give rise to ammonia and nitrie acid. Even if
the nitrogen of the air takes part in nitrification, a part of the nitrogen will exist in
mycoderms, or their remains.
