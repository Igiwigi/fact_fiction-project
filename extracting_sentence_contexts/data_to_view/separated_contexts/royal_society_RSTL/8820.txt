'Thus, out of 31 flasks opened in the same air, 18 remained intact, while 13 were
taken possession of by organisms—a fact obyiously the same in character as that
described by PasTeuR. Such experiments demonstrate, if demonstration were needed,
that it is not the air itself, or any gaseous or vaporous substance uniformly diffused
through it, but some discontinuous substance floating in it, that is the cause of the
infection. Instead of our tubes let us suppose thirty-one wounds to be opened in the
same ward of a hospital; plainly what has occurred with the tubes may occur with
these wounds—s0me may receive the germs and putrefy, others may escape.
