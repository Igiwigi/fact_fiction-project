*; and though the magneerystallic force was sufficient to make the crystal
move and point, yet the very motion s0 produced generated the current which reacted
upon the tendency to motion, and 80 caused the mass to advance towards its position
of rest as if it moved in a thick fluid.

2515. Having this additional knowledge respecting the arrest and reyulsion of the
antimony (effects dependent upon its superior conducting power, in this compact
crystalline state, as compared with bismuth), one has no difficulty in identifying the
magnecrystallic force of this metal with that of the former, and the correspondence
of the results in all essential characters and particulars. In most of the pieces of
crystals of antimony the force seemed less than in bismuth, but the fact may not
really be 80, for the inductive current action just described, tends to hide the mag-
necrystallic phenomena.

2516. Different pieces of antimony also seern to differ from each other in their
setting force, and also in their tendency to exhibit revulsive effects; but these dif-
ferences are either only apparent, or may easily be explained. The arresting and
revulsive action depends much upon the continuity of the mass, 80 that one large
piece shows it much better than several small pieces, and these again better than a
