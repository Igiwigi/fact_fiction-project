a result of reduction from a larger type, similar in nature to that seen in Todea,
though carried further. We have noted above (p. 41) that the “filmy” Zodeas
have a smaller output per sporangium than 7. barbara ; this suggests that reduction
of output accompanies the “ filmy” habit, and if this be so, then we may look upon
the simple sporangia of most species of Zrichomanes as simple by reduction, not by
primitive character.

Trichomanes is the simpler type of the Hymenophyllacez in its prothallus ; while
the prothallus of Zymenophyllum consists of a broad, ribbon-like expansion ; that of
Trichomanes is usually filamentous ; the archegonia in Ferns do not show distinctive
features, but Herm,t who has drawn attention to the value of their antheridia for
comparative purposes, specially notes the similarity of those of the Hymenophyllaceze
and of the Gleicheniacese. This is a fact of importance when taken along with the
data of spore-output now disclosed, since features of the reproductive organs of
both generations indicate a similar affinity. The result of a general comparison of
the Hymenophyllacese with other Ferns is summed up by CampseEtt in the following
sentences} :—‘ The Hymenophyllacese, on the whole, approach most nearly the
Gleicheniacee, with which they agree in many points, both in the sporophyte and
the gametophyte, but they also recall the Osmundaceve, and possibly may form a
branch somewhere between the two, but nearer the former. The peculiarities of the
gametophyte are probably in large measure the result of environment, and the
filamentous prothallium of some species of Z'richomanes is beyond question a
secondary and not a primary condition.” This expresses the view which I entertain,
