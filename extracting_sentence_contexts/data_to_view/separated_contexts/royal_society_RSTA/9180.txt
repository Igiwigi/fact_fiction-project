The fact that K,CO, does not diminish the luminosity due to Na,CO, seems to show
conclusively that the luminosity is not due to positive ions. The K,CO, increased the
number of negative ions about nine times, and, therefore, must have diminished, the
number of positive sodium ions in the same ratio. That the negative ions from
K,CO, do combine with the positive ions from Na,CO, is shown by the fact that the
conductivity of a mixture of sodium and potassium carbonates is less than the sum of
their separate conductivities as it should be according to the ionic theory. In conclusion, I wish to say that my thanks are due to the trustees of the Rice
Institute for the facilities for experimental work which they have provided.
