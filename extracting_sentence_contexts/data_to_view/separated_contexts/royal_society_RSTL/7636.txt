Five, if not six, of these dykes appeared at different places
in the section of the coast between the headlands of Atanekerdluk and Immarsoit.

Â«It has been already mentioned that this locality had been frequently visited * before
1867 for the sake of its fosil deposit. This was evident by numerous fragments that
we found in the course of our ascent, which had been dropped by others in descending,
and it seemed at first as if the deposit was very extensive. We found it in fact to be
confined within narrow limits. It did not appear to extend a greater length than 400
feet, with a maximum depth of 150 feet. In most places the portion exposed was
nothing mor? than a seam a few feet in depth.
