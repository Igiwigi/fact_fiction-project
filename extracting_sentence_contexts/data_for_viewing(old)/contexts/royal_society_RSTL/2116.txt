whole time of the experiment, whilst in the other it was heat-
ing during the first part of the time, it follows, that a greater
proportional temperature should be communicated to the
second screen by the first, than to the first by the iron ball.

Other circumstances will partially co-operate in producing
this effect; as the greater proximity of the second gcreen to the
thermometer : also more heat might be lost in. communicat-
ing an equable temperature to the first screen from its central
and most heated part; whilst the heat would be thus more
equally radiated to all parts of the second without such loss.

Thus it appears that the fact stated by M. Dz La Rocre
is fully substantiated ; while on the other hand it is satisfac-
torily accounted for, without supposing any new property of
heat, or any direct radiation through glass.

(10.) I have been more particularly led to this enquiry,
from becoming acquainted with some experiments on the
subject by Mr. Ritcntz, published in the Edinburgh Philoso-
phical Journal, No. XXII. p. 281 ; in which, among. other
conclusions (to which I shall presently advert), he maintains,
that at high temperatures below luminosity a portion of the
heat radiates through glass of ordinary thickness, but with-
out giving any details by which it can be made to appear
