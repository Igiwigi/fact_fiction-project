* In other forms, especially among the Cycadacec, the base of the phyllopodium shows

* The extension of the stipular development transyersely across the face of the phyllopodium is not
an isolated morphological fact : a similar extension is also to be found in the development of orbicular
leaves, snch as Tydrocotyle, Tropeolum, &c. This bas been clearly shown by Gogser (f Vergl, Rntw.,‚Äù p. 234). It will remain for future observations to 8show how far a similar comparative treatment may be applied
to the stipules of Dicotyledons,
