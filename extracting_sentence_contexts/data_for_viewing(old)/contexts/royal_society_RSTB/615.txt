side at the level of 6th to 7th dorsal segments. Sections were prepared after hardening in the usual
manner. (Vide photo-micrograph, Plate 1.)

Examination of the microscopical sections from this case showed complete destruction of the grey
matter at the seat of the injury, with hemorrhages and exudation of plasma. The posterior column and
the anterior and lateral columns of the left side were completely destroyed. The posterior column of the

* Note in connection with this case.—The animal was apparently hyperwsthetic on the paralyzed side

side; but I have found that some animals when frightened take no notice of pricking with a needle, and
again, the fact that the animal removed the clip from the non-paralyzed side, on all occasions, showed
conclusively that it was conscious of a sensation, which led to a purposive act, dependent for its
execution upon the higher volitional centres.

animal should have removed it on all occasions.
