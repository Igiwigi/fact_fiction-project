This is what we mean when we state that quantum mechanics on a basis described by a real
number q can be transformed to quantum mechanics with a basis of a pair of integers, Q and P.
Subsequently, one may transform to momentum space, using the matrix

(qip) =e". (4.11)

This procedure is not quite symmetric under the interchange Q <= P, q <= p, but this symmetry
can be restored [6]. At the same time, one can reduce the effects of edge states. This we do by
multiplying the coefficients of a wave function |) in the space of the pairs ng, np, by a complex
phase, <i#(ia-"), This phase can be chosen such that the coefficients become exactly periodic both
in np and in ng. This would remove the edge state completely, except for the fact that the phase
function ¢!” will feature a vortex singularity. This means that, at the very location of this vortex,
we still will have an edge state.

The result of this procedure, requiring a calculation that has been published elsewhere [6], is
that we obtain a transformation from the basis (q| or (p| to a basis of states (Q, P| that, apart from
a few signs, is entirely symmetric. We write for the q and p operators

q=Q+ag and p=P-+ap, (4.12)

where the operators ag and ap are not exactly restricted to the interval (-4, 3) but they will stay
of order one:
(-1)P+@+1 jp
