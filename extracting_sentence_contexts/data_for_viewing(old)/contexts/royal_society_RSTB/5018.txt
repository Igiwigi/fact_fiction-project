little beyond each, especially beyond the third, the false annual ring being more distinct
in the remainder of its course, on the right of the figures, appearing double in this region.
Tn Photo. 43 there is a local increase and fusion of the series in connection with the third
branch, which suggests its greater share in the production of the series. When the
tissues at the base of this branch are examined critically they disclose some interesting
features. In Photos. 39 and 41 the leaf trace subtending this branch is shown. It
displays more irregularity in its tissues and their connection with the stem than normal
traces, and the centre of this irregularity is just within the series of resin canals. In

fact, the trace itself has a resin canal at the level of the stem series. Above the branch
a greater irregularity occurs (Photos. 43 and 44). Here a ray is shown sharply diverted
to the left, at an angle of about 30 degrees, and the whole branch displaced in its subse-
quent course. There is also a lack of symmetry in branch No. 2, especially in the upper
part of the connection (Photos. 43 and 45), which will be more apparent by comparison
with a normal branch, such as that in Photo. 37, where the attachment is practically
bilaterally symmetrical.

From the features disclosed in the series of sections, it is evident that the branches
suffered a lateral downward strain just before the mid-season of their growth, when their
tissues were in a soft, growing condition. The agent that injured these two branches,
especially branch No. 3, is without doubt responsible for the major part of the outer
series of resin canals. In the case of both the inner and the outer series there are small
