We
refer to this slightly abstract construct as an ‘LN element’
(figure 1) to distinguish it from simple cells. The response

‘false’ match

of a single LN element will still depend upon the spatial 2
phase of a luminance grating, and so to build model complex a
cells it is usual to combine two LN elements that have RFs in x
quadrature (the RF in the second element is obtained by shift- z
ing all of the Fourier components through 90°). The fact that 3

the two LN elements are in quadrature confers phase invari-
ance on the model complex cell. The fact that the response of
both LN elements depends on disparity makes the model
sensitive to interocular phase difference. Note that once a single monocular RF has been defined
(of any shape), these rules completely define a model com-
plex cell selective for zero disparity (with identical RFs in
each eye, as in figure 1).
