In the 2013 season, 30 m of the frozen lake water was sampled by drilling. Unfortunately, the
rising water was heavily polluted with kerosene, which came from the abandoned (blind) 5G-
1 borehole (figure 1). This fact severely restricted the study of biomarkers and primary water
composition but was not restrictive for the recognition of the mineral fraction carried with the
lake water. We did not expect to find particles larger than 10â€”20 1m because they had to settle
from upper levels of water (at least below 30 m) before the water froze (i.e. in 22-24h). Two ice cores of frozen water from 3429 m (40 cm long) and 3448 m (30 cm long) were analysed
in an attempt to detect mineral microparticles.
