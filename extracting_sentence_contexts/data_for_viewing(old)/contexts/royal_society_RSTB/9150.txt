1. Introduction

Specialized pairs of microstructure-covered fields of arthropod cuticle often
function for mechanical adhesion (attachment) between different body parts
within an organism [1-5]. These systems are often called probabilistic fasteners
due to the fact that they are composed of cuticular micro-outgrowths of different
Author for correspondence: origin [6] and because the size, shape and density of the outgrowths on both
surfaces do not correspond exactly to each other. Thus, mechanical interactions
between the micro-outgrowths of both surfaces take place without precise posi-
tioning of both surfaces [1]. Probabilistic fasteners prevent sliding of surfaces,
when in contact. Mechanical adhesion (attachment), in this case, must depend
on the size, shape, distribution density and the material properties of outgrowths
(called elements in this paper), and is fast, precise and reversible. Individual
elements are not necessarily hook-shaped (figure 1). The mechanism of attach-
ment in such systems is definitely different from the typical hook-and-loop
Velcro principle, but has been only marginally studied for the case of probabilistic
fasteners with parabolic contact elements [5].
