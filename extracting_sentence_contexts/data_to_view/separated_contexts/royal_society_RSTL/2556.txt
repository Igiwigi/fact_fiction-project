Mr. WEsTBECK $aid that he had always heard from his father that the
mark, which was cut the year he was born, was intended to express the lowest level
of the sea during the digging of the canal in 1770. I have already stated that there is no tide on the coast here, a circumstance which
seems very extraordinary ; but all the pilots and seamen agree in asserting the fact. A strong wind off the shore causes the water to fall two or three feet, and to rise as
much if it he in the opposite direction. Notwithstanding these occasional oscilla-
tions, the inhabitants pretend to determine whether the sea is two or three inches
above or below its standard level.
