The leaf-bundles pass through it, but they clearly have no further
S connexion with it than results from that positional relationship. When I wrote the
2 second memoir of this series I had not ascertained 80 clearly as I have since done the
Z relations of these foliar bundles. Two facts, however, require further notice. One is that
2 in that memoir I described a unique bit of a Diplozylon-stem in which some vascular
Z bundles were given off from the ligneous zone, but whether or not they were foliar I
E cannot 8ay*. The otherrelates to S{igmaria.
