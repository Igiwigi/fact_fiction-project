age earned M = 10.37 ECU (s.d. = 3.63) per round, and Agents
M=8.83 ECU (s.d. = 7.20).

Just over one-third (36% of N =3,680) of messages were
lies. Comparing the difference between Agents’ actual trust-
worthiness (computed as percentage returned) and the
gossip describing this trustworthiness reveals that, on aver-
age, these lies were large. Just under half (47%) of lies were
positive, claiming that M = 6.39 ECU had been sent and M=
11.12 returned, when in fact M=3.73 ECU had been sent
and M=2.51 returned. A very similar proportion (49%) of
lies were negative, claiming that M=6.39 ECU had been
sent and M=2.60 returned, when in fact M=5.54 ECU had
been sent and M=7.57 returned. The remainder (4%) were
ambiguous and omitted from the lie typology.”
