Our view of decoherence appeals to symmetry, invariance of S—entanglement-
assisted invariance or envariance under phase shifts of pointer state coefficients, equation (4.2). As S entangles with €, its local state becomes invariant under transformations that could have
affected it before. Rigorous proof of coherence loss uses quantum core postulates (0)-(iii) and relies on quantum
facts 1-3:

1. Locality: A unitary must act on a system to change its state. A state of S that is not acted upon
does not change even as other systems evolve (so 1s @ (ley Xe] + ele) \(e)|) does not
affect S even when S and € are entangled, in |Wse).

2.
