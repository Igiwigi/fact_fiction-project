diameter of the vessels; such a relation has already been indicated (BRown 1921;
CuaLk and Cuatraway 1935; Frost 1930a). Inthe Sterculiaceae the simple correlation
between these features was + 0-655 + 0-107; the partial coefficient, eliminating the
percentage of solitary vessels and vessel number, was rather lower (+ 0-408).


WOOD ANATOMY OF THE FAMILY STERCULIACEAE 323

One striking relation emerged from these figures—between the diameter and the
percentage of solitary vessels. The simple correlation coefficient was + 0-922 + 0-028,
which has increased to + 0-938 in the partial correlation coefficient eliminating
vessel-member length and vessel number. This relation does not appear to have any
significance beyond the fact that where groups are common the number of small
vessels is increased, and the mean diameter correspondingly reduced.

Making use of Frost’s (19304, 6) conclusions regarding vessel-member length, one
is led to the conclusion that Pterocymbium is the most primitive genus, and that, allowing
for some slight interchange in position between the genera, there is a gradual progres-
sive specialization through a series running as follows: Pterocymbium, Scaphium, Brachy-
chiton, Sterculia A, Firmiana, Tarrietia, Argyrodendron, Cola, Pterygota, Sterculia B, Heritiera,
Octolobus, Eribroma.

Specialization of the wood within this group of genera does not seem to be related to
the distribution of the vessels, but there is a slight positive relation to diameter.
