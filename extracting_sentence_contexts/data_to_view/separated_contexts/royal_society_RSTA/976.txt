Significant barriers remain, however,
before the aims of the Sponge City initiative can be fully met. In particular, the transformation
of old building stock and associated drainage infrastructure [33] will be hindered by planning
requirements for land modernization, pressure from land scarcity, land price inflation and
unresolved ownership issues. A sign that progress is being made in sustainable urban drainage in China is the fact that
while overseas expertise in LID, SUDS and WSUD is frequently referenced, examples of best
practice are increasingly being drawn from national rather than international examples [34]. This is particularly true in the area of infrastructure performance measurement and cost-benefit
analysisâ€”all of which bode well for the encouragement of future investment needed to sustain
the initiative into the future. Indeed, as the PPP model of investment becomes less assured, new
models for financing new development will be key in the delivery of national Sponge City aims.
