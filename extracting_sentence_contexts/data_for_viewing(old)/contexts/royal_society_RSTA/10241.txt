enounced by him. The attempt is given in an appendix to my paper, but
unfortunately I failed to understand his work completely, and my investigation,
as it stands, is erroneous from the fact that one term in the energy is omitted.*
I think, however, that the defect may easily be made good.

The analysis of the present paper is carried out by means of ellipsoidal harmonic
analysis. In the course of the work it becomes necessary to refer to previous. papers
by myself, all published in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions’; they are : “ Ellipsoidal
Harmonic Analysis,” vol. 197 (1901) A, pp. 461-557; “ The Pear-Shaped Figure of
Equilibrium of a Rotating Mass of Liquid,” vol. 198 (1902) A, pp. 301-331; “The
Stability of the Pear-Shaped Figure of Equilibrium, &c.,” vol. 200 (1903) A,
pp. 251-314; “The Integrals of the Squares of Ellipsoidal Surface Harmonic
Functions,” vol. 208 (1904) A, pp. 111-137. These papers are hereafter referred to
by the abridged titles “ Harmonics,” “The Pear-Shaped Figure,” “Stability,” and
“ Integrals,” :
