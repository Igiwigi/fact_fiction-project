This was recently shown in a helium-neon laser with a spot-defect
mirror [29]. A novel amplitude-based approach that does allow control over the handedness was
introduced by Lin et al. [30]. In this approach, two nanoscale-thickness aluminium strips were
inserted into a conventional diode-pumped solid-state laser, strategically placed to introduce
higher loss for one helicity when compared with the other by virtue of the fact that the standing
wave pattern is a lobe structure that rotates in opposite directions for the two helicities (figure 4). By this method, it was shown that helicities of = +1 could be selected. An alternative approach to selecting the desired mode is by shaping the pump light to be
annular [31].
