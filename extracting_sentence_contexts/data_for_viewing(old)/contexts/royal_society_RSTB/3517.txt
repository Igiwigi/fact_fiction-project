Primitivplatte zu keiner Zeit ein Stadium existirt, in dem Ectoderm und Entoderm yollstindig von
einander getrennt sind.”


OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 41

there is practically no ectodermal shield-differentiation around this primitive plate.
This “primitive plate” we take to be the initial stage in the formation of the
primitive knot, which will form the subject of future description.

The gap which separates the last two stages (“O” and “ alpha”) is an unfortunate
one, since, in the absence of an intermediate stage, we are unable to demonstrate the
mode of origin of the yolk-entoderm in Monotremes. But in view of the fact that,
in the earlier stage O, the yolk itself appears to be absolutely non-nucleated, the
yolk-entoderm cells probably owe their origin to the proliferative activity of some
of the cells which in that stage were shown underlying the otherwise unilaminar
blastoderm.

It has become usual to regard the establishment of a bilaminar blastoderm, through
the appearance of an entodermal or second germinal layer, in the Amniota, as
a partial and indirect manifestation of the process of gastrulation. Hence this
establishment of a second or entodermal layer has been recognised by Husrecur,
KerseEL, and others as constituting a “ first phase of gastrulation.”

We see no reason to believe that the processes representing this “first phase
