My late experiments have shown beyond all doubt that, the number of elements
taken from the same frogs being equal, the muscular current is much stronger than
the proper current. I have recently shown that when from defect of nutrition, a
very low temperature, or the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, &c., both the mascular
and the proper current of the frog are weakened, the diminution is much more con-
siderable in the latter than in the former. And in fact, composing the pile described
at p. 116 of my treatise with halves of frogs prepared by cutting the thighs in half, I
find a differential current varying in intensity, but always in the direction of the
muscular current. It is only in yery robust frogs, dividing the thigh in the thickest

part, and leaving a very small internal surface of the muscle exposed, that the differ-
ential current is found to be either null, or in the direction of the proper current.
