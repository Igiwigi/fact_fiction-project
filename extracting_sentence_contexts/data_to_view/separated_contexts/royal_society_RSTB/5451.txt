Mitosis is commonly seen in the mid-gut rudiment and this appears to account for
the main growth of the mid-gut. The development of the mid-gut from the proctodeal
end is very similar to that from the anterior end. The main difference lies in the fact
that the proctodzeum begins to form, while the posterior endoderm mass is still small. This entails a more prominent proliferation of cells from the blind end of the proctodzeum. In other words, the development of the proctodzeum coming so soon after the beginning
of the development of the posterior endoderm mass, the formative area of the posterior
endoderm rudiment is carried inwards to the end of the proctodwum.
