Hence it would appear that so long as portions of the frontal centres
remain intact, the movements of the head and eyes are not permanently paralysed. The prefrontal and postfrontal regions are shown by the secondary degenerative
changes demonstrated in Experiments 22 and 23, to be anatomically related to the
same tracts of the internal capsule and- crus cerebri. 'This fact also would indicate
community in their physiological relationships. Though the prefrontal regions did
not react, or very doubtfully, to electrical stimulation, yet this would nob militate
against their being considered part of the same physiological centre as the postfrontal
regions. For it was found that the occipital lobes did nob respond like the angular
gyri to electrical stimulation, and yet formed an integral portion of the visual centres.
