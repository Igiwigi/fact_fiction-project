and Dumas' views, observes, that * it is nseless to allude to the question of penetra-
tion by the spermatozoon, as he believes that the only living author of the theory has
himself renounced it}.‚Äù But very recently it has been announced, in a paper on
the Ascaris Mystar, by Dr. NEeLs0N, communicated to the Royal Society, that the
spermatozoon in that animal does penetrate into the snbstance of the yelk; and a
somewhat similar account of that of the Earth-worm was formerly given by Dr. ArzTfur
Fare ||. Yet, with all due respect for the observations of these able investigators, I
must still have hesitated to admit the fact of any penetration, eyen into the envelopes
of the egg, had I not more recently been convinced of this fact by direct observa-
tion, in correction of my former opinions, in s0 far as relates to the penetration of
the spermatozoon into the envelopes of the eggs of the Frog, and its arrival at the
vitelline membrane. To them, then, be all honour on this subject, while I subjoin
my testimony to a fact which I had heretofore failed to observe.

It was during the month of March last (1852), while making experiments on the
Frog's egg by artificial impregnation, before some scientific friends, that certain
appearances were noticed beneath the microscope within the expanded jelly of the
egg, which led to a snspicion of the probability of penetration by the spermatozoon.
Heretofore I had employed, in my observations, either a deep glass cell, in which the
egg was completely immersed in water, or the common object-glass of the microscope.
In the experiments now referred to, a shallow glass cell was employed, which was
capable of containing only a single egg. This, while it admitted light freely around
the egg, was too shallow for its complete immersion, and the egg was therefore
covered by a drop of water, into which the object-glass of the microscope was passed,
