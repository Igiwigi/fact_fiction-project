The phenomena are thus accounted for on the hypothesis that the electric charge
na conductor consists of a distribution of discrete electrons over its surface. It
js true that the facts of electric vibrations on conductors show that these electrons
must be extremely mobile and sensitive to electric force; this is because of the very
strong charges involved in them, but it does not imply that when the conductor is
rotated, the electrons will slip backward over its surface and remain where they were,
owing to the electric inertia. They will not take up the motion of the conductor just
at once ; but there is no electrie foree which would tend to prevent that result, and
the same steady viscous agencies that produce electric resistance when a steady
‘current of electrons is flowing in a fixed conductor, will ultimately make them move
‘with the rotating conductor, after a time relatively long but probably absolutely very

Pdifficulties of pure electrodynamie theory that are not removed by the hypothesis of
moving electrons, to which, from the consideration of several distinct classes of
phenomena, and apart altogether from electrochemical theory, we have been com-
Pelled to resort. This hypothesis, in its wider aspect involving the nature of matter
itself, seems also to have a philosophical necessity ; for the location of causes of
Fdisturbance of the uniform all-pervading medium in permanent discrete singularities
Sor nuclei of strain or motion, that belong to it and can move about through it, is
Sthe only way of avoiding the introduction into theory of either direct distance
suctions, or else those assumptions of independent media superposed in the same space
Zand discharging different functions, which violate the maxims of modern physics.
