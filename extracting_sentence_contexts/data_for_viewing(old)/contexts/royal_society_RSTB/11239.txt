in alignment with the standard model of system consolidation. Recent memory elicits the formation of basal dendritic spines in hippocampal area CA1 while remote
Memory is associated with both apical and basal spine changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) ([55, fig. 4]). (b) Findings of structural plasticity changes in
alignment with the multiple trace theory of memory consolidation. Spine density changes in anterior cingulate cortex occur within hours after contextual fear
conditioning (FC) ([91, fig. 3]). (c) Local structural plasticity changes may not be needed for a memory to be accessible. DG engram-specific spine density at
day 15 (remote memory) was significantly reduced compared with that on day 5 (recent memory), but on both days, optogenetic activation of DG engram
cells induced behavioural freezing ([18, fig. 3]). All figures are reproduced with permission. (Online version in colour.)

(mPFC spines were not monitored in this study), although 5. Epigenetic modifications and remote memory

spines are known to occur in an engram-specific manner
[29]. In agreement with these ideas, a reduced number
of spines in DG engram cells at 14 days post-training was
recently reported, despite the fact that behavioural fear
expression could be elicited optogenetically (figure 2c) [18].
Collectively, these incongruent findings point to the need
for an alternative explanation to spine dynamics for remote
memory stability.

An interesting fact in memory consolidation is the obser-
vation that the longer-lasting it is, the more resistant it
appears to disruption [122,123], giving rise to a consequential
passage of time effect once a commitment for a permanent
change has taken place. But what might this change be, if it
is not at the level of the spine? Certainly, a change of lasting
nature. As such, epigenetic mechanisms were postulated
