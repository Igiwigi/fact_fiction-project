There is a valuable historical survey of the experimental treatment of the problem
of free convection given by Compan(*) in the paper already cited, and also by Kine("*).
It is unnecessary here to cover the same. ground again. Two or three points,
however, require to be emphasised because they bear directly on the object of the
present enquiry. We have already stated that most experimenters on the rate of
cooling of a thermometer in an enclosure maintained at constant temperature have
been satisfied with the measurement of the velocity of cooling, #.e., with the rate of
loss of temperature.

This was all very well so long as the same instrument was used for all observations.
J. Vixcent, in his account of ‘‘ Nouvelles Recherches sur la Température Climato-
logique,” considers this fact a fatal objection to Hmserpen’s work (Joc. cit.), and
suggests that a possible way of overcoming the difficulty would be for all investi-
gators adopting the rate of cooling method to have their thermometers made to
the same pattern by the same maker. As already mentioned, our experience
does not support this contention, for kata-thermometers made to the same pattern
differ so much in their water equivalents that comparison of results obtained with
different instruments is out of the question unless the same have been properly
standardised.

It is essential, therefore, for the sake of scientific precision, to express the rate of
cooling in heat units per second. Uncertainty arising from changes in the tempe-
rature of the surrounding air in the cooling enclosure must also be avoided, and it is
not clear how far that condition was secured in the researches referred to. Another
