On a
farther investigation of this subject, a fact presented itself to
me, which may not be unworthy of the attention of this
Society, and, as it is in some measure connected with the
preceding observations, I have taken the liberty of annexing it. In those birds that remain but a short time paired with the
female, there appears a vast disproportion in the size of the
testes, compared with those that live in the connubial state
much longer. The cuckoo and the swift point out the fact
most obviously. The common brown wren, which remains
united with its female from the early part of spring, until the
autumn, exhibits testes very far exceeding‚Äù in size, either
those of the cuckoo or the swift. The cuckoo, although a
polygamist, may here be considered in the same point of
view as the birds that pair.
