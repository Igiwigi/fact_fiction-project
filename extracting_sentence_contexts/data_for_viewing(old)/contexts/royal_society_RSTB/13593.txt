rich typology of sign language types attested across the
world, together with the sign languages associated with the
presence of a deaf population, we must also count non-
primary sign languages that do not imply the presence of
an uncommonly high deaf population. As a matter of fact,
bimodal bilingualism (oral and signed language bilingual-
ism) is a relatively common feature among hunter-gatherer
societies, and does not depend on the presence of a deaf
population. This is the environment in which the sign
languages that have been called ‘alternate’ have developed
[65]. One of the first descriptions of an alternate sign
language is due to Walter E. Roth at the end of the nineteenth
century [103]. He carefully analysed many of the signs used
in the sign language of the Queensland First Nations. The
