This equation is satisfied identically if, for suitable values of a variable e, whose
imaginary part does not exceed unity, and whose real part is less than 2q, we can select
coefficients @, in accordance with

where each side is an odd function of ». The use of this apparently simple artifice
yields a definition of the coefficients which can in fact lead directly to a solution. The
value of the integral can be deduced from that of an integral due to Potsson, namely,

where | p|<|q|. Writing e for p and 2g for q, and integrating with respect to k from
zero to unity—this involves no delicate considerations if the preceding condition is
satisfied—we find
