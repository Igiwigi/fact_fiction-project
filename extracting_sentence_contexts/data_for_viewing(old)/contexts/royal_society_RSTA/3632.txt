being healthier and more successful at work, and, most relevant to this article, engaging
in prosocial behaviours. They summarized numerous cross-sectional studies reporting that,
compared with less happy people, happy people are more likely to volunteer, cooperate and help
others, to be good organizational citizens in the workplace, and to donate money and blood. More
importantly in the present context, Lyubomirksy ef al. [29] also reviewed a dozen or so studies
showing that individuals experimentally induced to be in a happy mood later behaved in more


prosocial ways than did those in a control group. For example, just reminiscing about positive
events in one’s life or answering positively toned questions like ‘If I set my mind to it, |can make
things turn out fine’ causes people to be more likely to volunteer, donate, and help others.

Although none of the studies reviewed by Lyubomirksy et al. [29] assessed PEBs, the fact that
many PEBs involve a sense of helping and being a good citizen suggests that feeling happy might
cause people to engage in more PEBs. Why might that be? According to Lyubomirksy et al. [29],
positive moods might lead people to view themselves as being more generous, to anticipate that
helping others will lead to positive outcomes (like expressions of gratitude), and to have more
positive views of others and therefore believe that one should act beneficently towards them.

A clear next step for testing this pathway would be to determine whether experimental
manipulations that put people into a pleasant (versus neutral or unpleasant) mood increase
the likelihood that they express concern for the environment or engage in PEBs like recycling,
re-using objects or choosing low resource ways to accomplish a task.
