the spines were much less numerous than on the typical spiny shoots. Their presence,
however, lessens the contrast between the two types of axes.

(4) The large sporangia have been investigated by the film-pull method in two museum
specimens. The existence in the sporangial wall of a black, carbonised, outer layer
(probably representing a thick-walled epidermis) and of a thin, brown, translucent
layer (representing a persistent tapetum) is demonstrated. These layers appear com-
parable to those shown in the sporangia of Rhynia.

(5) Spores have been demonstrated within a number of sporangia. They range in
size from 100 » to 60 », have smooth yellow or brown walls, and a small apical region.

(6) The bearings of these facts are indicated and briefly discussed.
