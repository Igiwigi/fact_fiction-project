The main type of steady solution which describes the rotor blade behaviour in the conventional a
forward flight operating envelope is a periodic orbit (limit cycle solutions). Conventionally, aed
helicopter rotor models have a constant rotor speed and are written in the non-autonomous 22
form, in that the independent variable t appears explicitly in the equations. In fact, the blade : Ss
azimuth angle w is a non-dimensional form of the time variable t. Unlike in helicopters, the rotor : s
in forward autorotation has a variable rotational speed. Hence the rotor is not forced to rotate at : s
a fixed frequency and the blade azimuthal angle y would then need to be modelled as a state 23

variable.
