IN GASES. These curves plainly show that the retardation of the explosion-wave depends upon
the density of the gas added as well as upon its volume-~a result in accordance with
Berruecor's theory. I think it a fair inference from these facts to conclude, when the addition of a gas
to an explosive mixture retards the rate of explosion by an amount which depends
upon its volume and density, that such added gas is inert, as far as the propagation of
the wave is concerned, and that any change which it may undergo takes place after
the wave-front has passed by—in other words, is a secondary change. §3. Oxygen Inert to Carbonic Oxide in Explosion of Carbon Compounds.
