Figure 2. Bifurcation diagram showing the UV branch (black), the Turing branch with wavelength A; (blue) and insets near
the folds of the Turing branch with branches of modulated states (red) corresponding to allowed spatial modulations on a half-
domain of length 2.54.7 and NBCs. There are in fact six such branches but C,D have nearly the same norm as the others as do E,F. Solution profiles B(x) (green) and W(x) (blue) near the upper fold (a = 1.0225, left) and lower fold (a = 0.98, right) are also
shown. The red dotted lines indicate the maximum and minimum values of B(x) for the corresponding stable Turing solution to
help with the detection of the modulation.
