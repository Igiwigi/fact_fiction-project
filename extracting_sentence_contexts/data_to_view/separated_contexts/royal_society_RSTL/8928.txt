The second argument is of far greater weight. It may be
put thus:—All persons would admit the validity of our conclusions if, having first
detected the element x, thus latent in its compounds, we were able to verify our hypo-
thesis by digging it out. x having been discovered, there would be but little doubt as
to the existence of w and »y. We have not got quite to this point, but nevertheless we
arenot 80 very far from it ; for we can show clearly that the application of the very same
formal principles of reasoning to existing facts would have enabled us similarly to detect,
prior to their isolation, the latent existence in their compounds of elements which have
actually been isolated*. Were we able to conduct, our chemical experiments only between certain fixed limits
of temperature (let us say between 0” and 300* C.), a barrier would be placed upon our
researches. We might still conduct innumerable experiments, but the science which
resulted from them would be eentially different to our present chemistry.
