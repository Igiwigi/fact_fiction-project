In view of the doubt which still attaches to estimates of the relation
between drag and wind speed, (7) should only be regarded as an approximate guide. In passing it may be pointed out that the thermocline slopes observed in figures 5, 7
and 8 are all, with the possible exception of figure 7, considerably less than those estimated
from (7). This does not necessarily point to inadequacies in the theory, but may be due to

a variety of causes: over-estimation of mean wind velocity, the fact that the fetch was not
long enough to allow the full drag to develop, or that the time of blow was not long enough
to build up the maximum slope. It is clear that time relations are important here, and it is
hoped that more detailed observations with adequate wind data will be made in future. In this connexion, the results of a theoretical investigation by Proudman & Doodson (1924)
of the time relations of meteorological effects on the sea surface may be applied.
