human mitochondrial ferrochelatase interacts with ABC
transporters [88]. Hence, a similar trafficking towards an
ABC transporter present in the chloroplast envelope is poss-
ible but remains to be characterized. There is also an urgent
need to identify whether and which protein(s) would serve
as soluble haem or haem-derivative receptors in plastids,
cytosol or nucleus for further trafficking. As these factors
may be similar to those involved in the trafficking of haems
towards haemoproteins (haem chaperone function), proteins
belonging to the HBP or GST families are obvious candidates
