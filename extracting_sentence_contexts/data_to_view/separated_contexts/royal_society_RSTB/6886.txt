This
favourable environment seems to have led to a rapid evolution of new types, most
particularly noticeable in the Lagenidae, which so largely dominate the Lias fora-
miniferal fauna. As a result of this rapid evolution, with an abundant population,
difficulties are found in the naming of many specimens of this family, which seem to
show a wider variation within the group than is often the case. In fact, the ‘species’,
and sometimes the ‘genera’ also, are by no means sharply defined. Certain authors have endeavoured to describe such Lias faunas by the multiplica-
tion of trivial names. By the nature of the problem these forms are generally ill-defined
and insufficiently differentiated from neighbouring species both in nature and by their
authors.
