o address whether perceived societal benefits command us to search for it, or
whether such an endeavour may rather turn out to be a threat to our own
existence (cf. [44]). Modelled after the Torino Scale for asteroid/comet impact
oredictions [45] and the Rio Scale for a putative discovery of extra-terrestrial
intelligence [46], the London Scale index (LSI) with values ranging from 0 to 10
ogether with an independently evaluated level of risk or biohazard [47] provides
an assessment of the scientific importance, validity and potential risks associated
with putative evidence of extra-terrestrial life discovered on Earth, on nearby
oodies in the Solar System, or in our Galaxy.

Various scenarios of encounters with extra-terrestrial life have already been
ortrayed in the science-fiction literature and films, some of these being more
scientific, others more fictional (cf. [48]). Imagination, however, must not be
underestimated as a valuable means to advance knowledge towards new frontiers,
and is not at all an unscientific concept. It is also valuable that a broad public has
een given the opportunity to reflect on this topic. Similarly, scientists involved
in relevant research themselves should engage with journalists and the public (cf.
49]). Media reports and weblogs debating extra-terrestrial life, including those
hat relate to this very Royal Society Discussion Meeting, also provide some
evidence on public opinion and reactions that can be expected.

If data are absent or ambiguous, we tend to argue by retreating to analogies
or theories about universalities. Historical examples, however, need to be well
understood before these can serve as a guide, which is demonstrated by the fact
