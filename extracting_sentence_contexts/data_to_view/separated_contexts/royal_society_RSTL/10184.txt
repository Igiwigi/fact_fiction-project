It may
be very abundant and of a loose flocculent character in one part, while elsewhere it
gradually disappears and is replaced by a definite membrane lying between the
ectoderm and entoderm, which is unmistakably the supporting lamella. In favourable |
specimens the granular mass may be traced around the section, becoming more and
more closely compacted until it passes directly into the supporting lamella. These facts leave no doubt that the supporting lamella is derived from the
granular mass, which becomes compacted together to form a definite membrane. The
granular mass probably never has naturally any considerable thickness, being com-
pacted into the membrane as 800n as it is formed. The loose flocculent character is
probably produced by the action of the reagents which causes the material of the
gupporting lamella to swell up, while the central mass at the same time shrinks away
from the ectoderm, forming the cavity in which the granular mass lies.
