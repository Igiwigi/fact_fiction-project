electrical combination.

obscure, or their experiments inaccurate, they were neglected:
the chemical and electrical phenomena exhibited by the won-
derful combination of Volta, at that time almost entirely
absorbed the attention of scientific men ; and the discovery
of the fact of the true connection between electricity and
magnetism, seems to have been reserved for M. OxrsrTeD,
and for the present year.

This discovery, from its importance and unexpected nature,
cannot fail to awaken a strong interest in the scientific world -
and it opens a new field of enquiry, into which many experi-
menters will undoubtedly enter : and where there are $0
many objects of research obvious, it is scarcely possible that
Similar facts should not be observed by different persons.
The progress of science is, however, always promoted by a
speedy publication of experiments; hence, though it is pro-
bable that the phenomena which I have observed may have
