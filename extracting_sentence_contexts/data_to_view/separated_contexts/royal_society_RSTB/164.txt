Du Bots-Reymonp.—The extensive work of pu Bors-ReyMonD (18) remains to be
referred to. This deals not so much with the response of the organ to excitation of
its electrical nerve as with the peculiar behaviour of the organ itself in respect to the
passage through it of electrical currents. The main facts which are thus brought out
may be broadly stated as of two kinds. First, those relating to the electromotive pro-
perties of the organ after the passage through it of an electrical current; and, secondly,
those relating to the influence exerted by the organ upon the traversing current
itself—in other words, phenomena of polarisation or after-effect, and of conduction. In both these respects the behaviour of the tissue varied with the direction of the
electrical experimental current.
