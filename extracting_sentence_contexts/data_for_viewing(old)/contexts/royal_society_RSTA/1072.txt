Figure 4. Vortex trajectories past an oscillating fibre of frequency c with initial phase yr without a mean flow, « = 0:
(a) @ = 011; (b) w = 1; (Cm = 10. The grey sector indicates the region in which the fibre oscillates. (Online version in colour.)

These results for vortex sound generated by a fibre oscillating with prescribed motion
suggest at least two strategies in which fibre unsteadiness could weaken the resulting acoustic
emission. First, if the phasing of the motion influences the vortex trajectory in a way that
increases the minimum distance between the vortex and fibre, the peaks of the acoustic signature
are reduced. Second, the acoustic emission is reduced when the speed of the vortex in close
proximity to the fibre is reduced. These strategies based on the dynamic vortex-fibre interplay
are supported by the fact that the reduced acoustic pressure Pr due to the vortex dominates
the total acoustic field. The radiation due to the angular acceleration of the fibre is largest (but
still relatively insignificant) for # =10 with an amplitude of |Ps| ~ 1.04; this acoustic pressure
amplitude changes by a factor of w” to render this contribution negligible at smaller fibre vibration
frequencies.
