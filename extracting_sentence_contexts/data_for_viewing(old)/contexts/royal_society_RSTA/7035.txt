THE SOFT X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF SOLIDS 119

edge width of about 2:5-0-5 eV for K(L,) V, as compared with 0-5 eV for K(L,3) V,
in the case of Al K-radiation (8 A). It follows that the Auger process L, > L, causes
an edge width of the order of 2 eV for the Al K(L,) V-radiation and hence an equal
edge width for the Al L, V-radiation. Since the absolute edge width for Al L,-radiation
is certainly less than a few hundredths of 1 eV, it is clear that the intensity of the ,-
emission band of Al should not exceed about 1 % of that of the L-band.

In absorption, the L,-edge should be diffuse, but it should not, of course, be weak.
In fact, owing to the greater strength of s—> / than of p > s absorption transitions, its
strength should exceed the statistical ratio of 1 : 2 as compared with that of the L,-
absorption edge. Absorption data in the required region have been given by Skinner
and Johnston (1937) and by Johnston (1939) * for Mg and Al respectively. Neither show
any evidence ofa sharp L,-absorption edge. The approximate position of the absorption
can be estimated. Near the required place a diffuse but strong maximum of absorption
is observed both for Mg and Al. It seems fairly sure that the L, ‘edge’ lies on the slope
to the long wave-length side of this maximum, i.e. at 180-190 A for Mg and 130-140 A
for Al. The L,-absorption system is superposed upon the Z,,-system in this region, and
the characteristics of either cannot be deduced without making an assumption about
those of the other.

We next come to the discussion of the relative intensities of L,- and L,-emission bands
