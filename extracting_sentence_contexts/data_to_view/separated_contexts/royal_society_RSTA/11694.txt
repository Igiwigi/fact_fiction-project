pillars of ebonite of from 8 to 20 centims. long, and the two points of the reversing
key requiring special insulation are made by placing ebonite cups on the ends of two
pillars of fused quartz, each about 10 centims. long. The advantage of fused quartz
as an insulator—where it is exposed to dusty air—lies not so much in its great
freedom from surface effect, as observed by Boys (‘ Phi]. Mag.’ [5], vol. 28, p. 14), as in
the fact that a small oxy-hydrogen flame can be applied to it without fear of breakage,
and thus the insulation be made practically perfect for the day, without any rubbing
or deranging of contacts. The advantages of the general arrangements are—

(1.) The points at which the insulation requires to be perfect are reduced to the
fewest possible.

(2.) The system being definitely earthed at the galvanometer, gives a complete
protection against electrostatic effects, which are very noticeable when this precaution
is not taken.

(3.) The general insulation of the system is necessary when the evaluation of the
galvanometer sensitiveness, or the capacity of the sulphur condenser, has to be
determined, and it is a great convenience to secure this by disconnecting a single
wire. The insulation of the “new galvanometer,” by means of fused quartz rods,
will be explained in its proper place (see p. 88).
