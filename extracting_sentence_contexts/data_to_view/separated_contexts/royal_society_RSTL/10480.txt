The sponge-beds appear not to continue with any regularity in a horizontal diree-
tion, and they vary also in their characters in short distances. Thus the beds in the
cliff section to the west of the harbour, though only imperfectly shown, are thicker, |
and decidedly contain more chert than those of the section deseribed. This fact has.

Devonshire, which latter, as will be shown in the sequel, are likewise s8ponge-beds.
