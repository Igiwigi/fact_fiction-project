containing a perfect spire of chambers, and large onés which are empty, appears to
point to the conclusion that the empty Orbulina shells when small contained such
chambers. What is the relation between the Orbulina shell and the contained chambers? The suggestion that these constitute a young individual about to be set free i

the Orbulina shell; (2) that they are often seen in stages of degeneration ; and (3)
that the largest Orbulina shells are empty and complete.
