1. Introduction

A large body of research supports the view that learning in the brain relies on
complementary learning systems. One of these systems, based primarily in the
hippocampus and related structures, allows the rapid acquisition of new knowl-
edge; the other, based primarily in neocortex, supports the acquisition of
structured knowledge that generally builds up over relatively long time scales.
The primary evidence for this view comes from the effect of extensive bilateral
lesions of the hippocampus and related structures in patient HM and sub-
sequently in other neuropsychological patients and animals. In humans, these
lesions profoundly impair the acquisition of arbitrary new memories, while
leaving intact previously acquired knowledge and skills, as well as the ability
to gradually acquire new skills and often-repeated factual information.
