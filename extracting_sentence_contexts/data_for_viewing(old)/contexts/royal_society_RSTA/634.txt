image.

— This technique can also be extended to three-dimensional image reconstruction.

— For a typical PC like the one used for this study, the nonlinear level set algorithm
presented here takes 34s to run the experimental data for a mesh of 1367 elements (the
mesh used for this study), and 65s for a mesh of 2064 elements. Such computation times
are not ideal for online measurements, as they will not allow real-time measurements
of the process. Hence, other optimization techniques can be applied to arrive at the best
results in terms of image resolution and computation time. One important optimization
would be to implement this algorithm in high-performance computing such as GPU.

In addition to the fact that the level set approach does promise to make an ill-posed problem
better behaved, it offers other advantages such as the following:

— the level set method allows one to perform numerical computations of a geometrical
object containing curves and surfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid without the need to
parametrize such objects;


— the level set method has the ability to follow shapes with changing topology (i.e. split in
to multiregions, develops holes or vice versa);

— the level set method does not require any a priori assumptions about the topology (i.e.
spatial location) or the nature (i.e. shape and size) of the inclusion;
