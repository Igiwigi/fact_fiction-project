We shall now investigate the corrections which must be applied to the above results,
There is, in the first place, a mechanical correction depending on the fact that the
plane which contains the four points S, S', 'T, 'T', and which also happens to contain the
centre of gravity of the bending apparatus (7. e. of the crosspiece and other pieces rigidly
attached to it), does not, contain the point 4 on which the apparatus is supported. Tet

& « denote the distance of this plane below the point 2, and W the weight of the bending
A apparatus. Als let A denote the horizontal distance of one of the points S or 'I from 7,
5 and w the weight hung at S or T, and let 9 denote the angle through which the end of
the rod is bent or twisted. Then the couple which produces bending or twisting is
s w(A—ab), and this is resisted by two couples, Was, due to: the weight of the bending
D apparatus, and 79 or f9, due tothe torsional or flexural rigidity # or f. We have therefore,
