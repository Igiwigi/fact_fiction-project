interesting. These were at first thought to be faint carbon lines, but it was noticed
that in certain spectra, especially of titanium, these lines came out with strong intensity.
It was then noticed that another pair of lines, namely 818-2 and 814-7, also appeared
with considerable intensity on the same plate in which the first pair were strongly repre-
sented. It was therefore concluded that these lines very likely belong to the sharp
series of trebly-ionised silicon, as given by Fowxer.{ These lines are omitted from
most of our tables in which they appeared, except Ti, in which they appeared with maxi-
mum intensity. The wave-lengths recorded for them in this table are average values
obtained from a considerable number of plates.

In the spectrum of calcium there is only a fair correspondence in the lines assigned to
this element by various observers. The spectrum of ionised calcium seems to be entirely
missing from our plates, with the sole exception of 1555-7, in spite of the fact that the
Fundamental Series of doublets is clearly present in the results of all other observers,

excitation there more nearly approaches that used in this work than the methods employed
by any other, and the results should be more nearly comparable. It is probable that the
