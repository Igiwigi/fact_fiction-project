The aluminium band was now removed and the experiment again repeated. At
the pressure of maximum gensitiveness the revolutions of the fly were only 8:5
revolutions a minute, diminishing on each side of this pressnre.

The black aluminium band was replaced, and a fly, with clear mica vanes, not
blacked, and favourably presented (273), was suspended in the instruament. The
experiments were now repeated as in the last case, and the result was as beforeâ€”
that the fly rotated more quickly with the aluminium band in, than when it was
absent,

The increased speed in these experiments must not be entirely attributed to the
fact that the blacked aluminium band presents a better reacting s8nrface for the
rebounding molecules than does the polished glass. In the first place, the intro-
duction of the metal band slightly diminished the distance between the fly and
the reacting surface; and in the second place, the rays from the candle not only
shone on the fly, but also on the opposite hemi-cylinder of black aluminium, and
warming ib converted it into a driving surface. Fach of these actions would
cause an increase of 8peed in the fly; but added together, they could only account
for a part of the jump from 84 to 40 revolutions. The diameter was only to a slighb
extent diminished, and it has been shown that a much greater reduction of diameter
(437) had only power to add 50 per cent. to the speed. The effect which the light
of the candle shining on the blackened hemi-cylinder would have on the speed
was ascertained by placing the candle in snch a position that it would illuminate
the inner half of the aluminium band, while its direct action on the fly was cut off
