We seem here, therefore, to have a crucial
test of the validity of the theory, which may be quite as easy to apply as the previous
test of the numerical value of the parental correlation. Of course the results now reached are not consistent theoretically with normal
correlation surfaces with their elliptic contour lines. The fact that Mr. Ganron came
to his elliptic contours in the first instance on the basis of his observations, and not
from any theory,* shows that they must in the case he was dealing with be approxi-
mately correct. Further, there is no doubt that in other statistics for characters in
man there is within the limits of random sampling a close approximation to normal
distribution.
