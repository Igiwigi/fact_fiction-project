Consider a DNA region D that can bind a set of proteins Xi
(i=1,...,n), each with multiplicity m;. Let the cytoplasmic protein concentrations be [Xi]. This
binding event can be represented as

k

7"
D+mjX1 + m2X2 +--+ +1nXn = D- X1m, + X2m, +++ XMm,,- (2.1)
k

For simplicity in the discussion that follows, this representation clubs together what are in
fact several independent binding events, and includes effective rate constants ky and kâ€” for


this clubbed reaction. Indeed, there might be several configurations of the bound state: other
combinations in which the DNA can bind these proteins. Let s; represent these various states
(including the one in which the DNA is bare).
