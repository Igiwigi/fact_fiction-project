which are correlative to Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations and establish Bohr’s interpretation
of them. In Bohr’s interpretation, one only deals with complementary phenomena manifested in
observable parts of measuring instruments, under the impact of quantum objects, and the classical
properties of these observable parts, to which and only to which, rather than quantum objects,
the uncertainty relations now apply. Non-realism could in fact be inferred from complementarity,
because the latter prevents us from ascertaining the complete composition of the ‘whole from
parts’, to the degree that the latter concept applies, because the complementary parts never add
up to a whole in the way they do in classical physics or relativity.

I would like to close this section by noting a more general long-term impact of Heisenberg’s
approach on twentieth-century and then twenty-first-century physics. This thinking not only
introduced a new type of mathematical model in physics, which is an epochal achievement
already, but, by the same token, also established a new way of doing theoretical physics. In fact,
it also redefined the practice of experimental physics in quantum regimes, at least as this practice
appears from the non-realist perspective adopted here.

The practice of experimental physics no longer consists, as in classical physics, in tracking
the independent behaviour of the systems considered. Instead, it consists in unavoidably creating
configurations, by now almost unbelievable in their complexity (think of the Large Hadron
Collider, where the Higgs boson was recently discovered), of experimental technology that
reflects the fact that what happens is unavoidably defined by what experiments we perform,
how we interact with quantum objects, rather than only by their independent behaviour.
These configurations, of course, relate to quantum objects. But they embody the effects of
the interactions between quantum objects and measuring instruments, through which effects
quantum objects are defined and, when possible, distinguished from one another, while always
