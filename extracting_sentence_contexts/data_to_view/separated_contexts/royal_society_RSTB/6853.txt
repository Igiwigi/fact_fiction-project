Discussion

An interesting comparison can be made between the giant-fibre system of the prawn
and that of the earthworm. In the latter animal three giant axons, provided with myelin
sheaths, pass along the ventral nerve cord. They are not, however, continuous; for in each
segment the axoplasm is traversed by a septum, so that the giant fibres are in fact made up
of a chain of segmental axons like the lateral fibre system in the crustacean. The axoplasm
of each segmental fibre is completely separated by the septum from that of the next fibre
in the chain. Each fibre of the chain has been shown to be a syncitium, for they are made
up by the fusion of the processes of several nerve cells in the corresponding ganglion.
