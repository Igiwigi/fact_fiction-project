Therefore, :3
they cannot be found out by initially ignorant observers through direct measurement without :
getting disrupted (reprepared). Yet, the states of macroscopic systems in our everyday world seem
to exist objectively—they can be found out by anyone without getting disrupted. This ability to
find out an unknown state is in fact an operational definition of ‘objective existence’. So, if we are
to explain the emergence of everyday objective classical reality, we need to identify the quantum
origin of objective existence. We shall do that by dramatically upgrading the role of the environment: in decoherence theory,
the environment is the collection of degrees of freedom where quantum coherence (and hence
phase information) is lost.
