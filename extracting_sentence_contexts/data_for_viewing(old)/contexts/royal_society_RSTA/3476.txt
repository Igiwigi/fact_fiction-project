automated calculations of the uncertainties. A quantification of the uncertainties of each
dataset can be performed objectively by determining the uncertainties related to equipment,
sampling, data interpretation etc. But when interpreting the geology of the area, different
data types are combined and a high degree of subjectivity is introduced by the geologist.
In the interpretation process, the uncertainties of the individual datasets are not additive,
creating a higher model uncertainty.

Thus, it seems that in geology the subjective component of the process of decision-making
is no less important than in cognitive psychology or economics. As was already pointed out,
this viewpoint was presented in great detail in the paper of Baddeley et at. [11] devoted to the
comparative analysis of decision-making in geophysics and the humanities.

In fact, the aforementioned subjective component in geological decision-making is closely
coupled to contextuality of data collected on different scales and by multiphysics techniques.
Observations cannot provide a complete picture of subsurface processes. The number of drillings
is restricted. Each well gives some portion of information about these processes, but it is far from
being complete.


(c) Geology: physical space reality or mathematical illusion? 8 |

The ideology of ‘objectivity of classical physical processes’ is heavily based on the idea about
‘really existing physical space’. The latter is mathematically modelled as the Cartesian product of :f
three real lines, R°. Moreover, typically one does not distinguish the mathematical model R° from E
its physical counterpart. Therefore, physical processes modelled with dynamical systems in R°,
