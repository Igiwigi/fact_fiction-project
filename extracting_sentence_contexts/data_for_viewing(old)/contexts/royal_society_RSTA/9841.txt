The specimen in this case has been slowly cooled from fusion and is therefore in a
meta-stable condition ; dark cores of primary y are surrounded by sheaths of decom-
posed 8, leaving a residue of eutectic. The decomposition of the 8 body is not
obvious in this photograph, but is very clearly seen in fig. 25 representing a portion
of the same specimen as fig. 24 but magnified by 500 diameters. Here the laminated
structure of the rims of decomposed £8 is very evident. In fig. 26 (x 150) we have
the micro-structure of alloy No. 77, which in this respect is typical of all alloys
containing less than 78 per cent. of zinc, after annealing for a considerable time at
430° C. followed by quenching from a temperature just above 256° C. The specimen
exhibits a perfectly homogeneous structure merely diversified by a few holes and
cracks. If this structure were met with only in the alloy of the composition of the
compound Al,Zng, the structure might be described as that of the pure 8 meteral, but
as a matter of fact this same homogeneous structure is exhibited by all the alloys
containing less than 78 per cent. of zinc which have been treated in the same way.
It follows from this observation that the 8 body forms a solid solution with the y
body, since to the right of the line GFK the reaction y+liquid = 8 must leave a
residue of y. For purposes of distinction the authors have termed this solid solution
of 8 and y the } meteral. The 8 which is dissolved in this 3 body, at any rate so
long as it is present in any considerable quantity, still undergoes decomposition at the
temperature of the line JKL, and the phases present below this line are again y+,
but of course the amount of a decreases rapidly with decreasing concentration of
zinc. It has not, however, been found possible to determine microscopically the
concentration at which « ceases to appear in the alloys.
