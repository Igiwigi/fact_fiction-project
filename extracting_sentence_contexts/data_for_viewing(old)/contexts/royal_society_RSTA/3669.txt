In this section, we show how coils and other related patterns may be used as building blocks
towards the fabrication of larger structures.

Using the settings provided in §3b, we print a piece by moving the nozzle along a circular
trajectory with a relatively large radius R = 50 mm > R¢. Upon completion of a circle, the printing
plate is lowered to account for the filament thickness, and another circle is made. In figure 5a,
we show a photograph of the experiment, where the circular path followed by the nozzle is
evident. In figure 5b, we provide a computerized tomography scan of the resulting structure,
which appears as if the glass threads have been ‘woven’ into a wicker basket. Further, this
metaphor becomes instrumental, since each layer presents bonds with adjacent layers, resulting
in overall strong mechanical cohesion. We note that those bonds—as well as their distribution—
are irregular. This is attributed to the fact that, as a coil forms, it crosses its own path, effectively
resulting in the formation of a bump. As a result of this effective roughness, only a fraction of
the thread contacts the neighbouring layers. This result contrasts with conventional prints, where
a single thread follows the exact path of the nozzle, and where each layer fully bonds with the
previous and following layers, strongly stiffening the resulting structure [23]. However, the latter


is more exposed to catastrophic fracture than the former: in its ‘woven’ configurations, we expect
that a mechanical load large enough to damage the structure will lead to a series of small cracks
distributed in the wall, as opposed to a single catastrophic fracture crossing the entire structure.
