that of normal silver ;’I and pressure “instantly converted gold-coloured allotropic
silver into normal silver.”**

We conclude from the above evidence that this silver was not “allotropic,” but
consisted of normal silver in a finely divided state.

14. Hermann VoceEt’s Silver.

Before leaving the consideration of these discontinuous forms of silver, reference
must be made to a paper by Hermann VoceEr,tt in which the author describes how

* “The least touch of the finger removed the film of gold. . . . These films, though they are certainly
porous to gas . . . . have evident optical continuity” (FARADAY, loc. cit., p. 439). Cf. also the facts that
films analogous to CAREY Lxa’s did not conduct (BARUS and SCHNEIDER, loc. cit., p. 285), and that the
phosphorous films did not sensibly conduct electricity (FARADAY, loc. cit., p. 407).

} This is the colour by transmitted light when p is fairly small. Cf. figs. 9 and 11.

§ This is the reflected colour for values of » from zero to nearly -8. Cf. fig. 13.

|| Professor R. W. Woop repeated this experiment, using glass instead of paper to support the silver
film. The metallic effect, then, does not disappear, but remains after the film has become quite dry.
