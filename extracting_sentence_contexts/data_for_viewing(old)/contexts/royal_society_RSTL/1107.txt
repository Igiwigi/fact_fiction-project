on a large scale, as I have no doubt that, with proper care,
one part in a thousand, or even less, of manganese might be
insulated from iron.

The separation of iron from uranium cannot be accom-
plished by the process above described, that metal possessing
a property analogous to that which forms the subject of this
paper. By inverting the process, however, we shall succeed
even here. A mixed solution' of iron and uranium being
de-oxidized by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen, and then
treated with an earthy carbonate, the iron passes in solution
while the uranium separates. This difference in the habitudes
of the two oxides of iron presents us in fact with a kind of
chemical dilemma, of one or the other of whose horns we
may avail ourselves in any proposed case. In studying the
habitudes of uranium, however, I have met with some anoma-
lies which require farther investigation. Zirconia too might
probably be freed from iron with equal facility by a similar
inversion of the process ; but this I have not yet had an op-
portunity of trying satisfactorily.
