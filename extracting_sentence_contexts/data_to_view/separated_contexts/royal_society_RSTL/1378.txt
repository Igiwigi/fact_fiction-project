This defect in the eye I am led to believe is brought on by
the cornea losing its elasticity as we advance in life, neither
contracting nor being elongated to its usual extent, but re-
maining in a middle state. That elastic substances in the body
do undergo such a change may be well illustrated in the vas-
cular system. The aorta is composed almost entirely of elastic
substance, and there is probably no part of the body, at an ad-
vanced age, which is so often found to have lost its natural
action ; it appears to undergo a change from age alone, be-
coming inelastic, and then taking on diseases of different kinds,
as being ossified, or becoming aneurismal ; but in neither of
these diseases is it found to be contracted, although often the
reverse, and when disease has not supervened, the artery more
commonly remains in the middle state. ;

The cornea having similar properties must be liable to a
similar change, but its action being less constant, and the
power which it is to resist being weaker, the change will be
probably more gradual and less in degree, but sufficient to

account for the alteration we find in the focus of the eyes of
old people,

There are many other circumstances respecting vision, and
many which occur in disease, that may be exptained by a
knowledge of these facts; but as this lecture is only intended
to establish the facts themselves, in doing which I have already
taken up too much of the time of this learned Society, I shall
at some future period consider their application to the phae-
nomena of vision in health, and disease. P

tendons insensibly lost in the external lamina of the cornea,
