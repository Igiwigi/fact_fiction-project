MOIR: THE TRANSITION FROM ROSTRO-CARINATE FLINT IMPLEMENTS

that this extension of the keel was accompanied, inevitably, by the reduction in size
of the dorsal platform. He also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag

period onwards the width of the ventral plane suffers a marked reduction. The Post-
Crag rostro-carinates, in fact, show an ever-increasing tendency to be compressed
from side to side. In the Middle Glacial Gravel of Suffolk, a deposit later in age
than the Red Crag, a series of rostro-carinates has been found which shows clearly
the characteristics above described. A diagrammatic drawing of one of these rostro-
carinate implements from the Middle Glacial Gravel is given in fig. 5, and it will be seen

that in the Norwich test specimen (fig. 4) the point B, which represents the furthest
extension of the keel towards the posterior region (the keel commences at the
point A), is situated about in the middle of the dorsal surface of the implement,
whereas in the Middle Glacial specimen the backward extension of the keel is
greater, and in consequence the distance between A and B is more extended.
