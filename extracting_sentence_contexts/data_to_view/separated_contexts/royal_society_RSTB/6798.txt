SUMMARY

I. From observations on the chromosomes of Osmunda regalis by three different
technical methods (sections, aceto-carmine squashes and ammoniated smears), the
following facts among others have been elucidated:

(1) The haploid complement is 22 chromosomes, closely similar in length and with
terminal or subterminal (but not median) attachment constrictions. (2) The number of coils made visible by the ammonia technique is 4 for the first
meiotic division; 8, of smaller diameter, for the second meiotic division; and ca. 14
(i.e. 12-16) for a cell of the tapetum.
