experimental observations, we carried out BXD simulation of the ions diffusing inside of the
monolayer towards the surface with subsequent desorption. For a reaction coordinate, we used
the distance from the ion centre of mass to the surface. The residence time was estimated
using the kinetic master equation. The BXD module in the CHARMM code was used, and BXD
box-to-box rate constants were obtained. The rate constants were corrected by the previously
discussed decorrelation procedure, which excludes the correlated velocity inversions separated
by very short time. The rate constants included an additional correction, designed to account
for the presence of image charge at the gold surface. This procedure allows one to compute the
survival probability for ions diffusing from the monolayer to the vacuum, which is shown at
figure 4a, yielding the residence time of 91s for (CH3)2SiNCS* and 1.5s for the more compact
SiNCS* ion, which explains why SiNCS* is not seen in the mass spectrum at long times.

This system provides a nice demonstration of the fact that BXD is capable of reaching time
scales which are many orders of magnitude longer than the time scales typically recoverable by
atomistic simulations. This is because of BXD’s multiscale approach: atomistic simulations yield
box-to-box rate constants, which are used as subsequent input for kinetic analysis, covering much
longer times.

BXD is also being applied to better understand the elementary chemical mechanisms that guide
diamond etching—a process wherein solid-state diamond is converted to its gas-phase atomic
constituents [37]. In particular, BXD is being used to understand the kinetics and thermodynamics
for dissociation of methyl radicals from diamond surfaces, according to the scheme in figure 5a,b.
