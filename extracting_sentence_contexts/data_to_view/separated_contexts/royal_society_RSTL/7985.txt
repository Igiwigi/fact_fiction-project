Whilst these changes have been going on, corresponding
ones have connected the remaining procambial cells into an interrupted ring of prosen-
chyma with somewhat thickened walls, or, in other words, into a ring of limiting tissue,
making the whole axis a closed bundle. 'The cortical layers appear to be composed of
meristem ; that is, they do not grow from any true cambial structure, but by the division
of the preexisting cells of all the parts, until the normal dimensions of each stem are
reached. The central vascular bundle of the axis thus represents the Xylem, and its
investing prosenchyma the Phlbem, whilst the bark derives its existence from an inde-
pendent source, originating in the primitive cellular tissue. In the plant quoted most
of the vessels of the fibro-vascular bundles appear to be derived from the leaves. 'The
outer vyessels of these bundles are smaller in size as well as more spiral in structure
than the inner ones. 'These facts have an important bearing upon the interpretation of
our fossil forms. NAGEL has argued that the fibro-vascular bundles belong to the stem
and not to the leaves, because he finds such bundles in Psilotum, in which the leaves are
deprived of them ; but the Psﬆ#lotum is altogether s0 exceptional a form that it can
scarcely outweigh the evidence afforded by the Lycopodia and Selaginelle. Guided by these examples, I think we can ascertain the homologies of the fossil stems
80 far as their tissues are represented in the living types.
