It is gratifying to me to state that no part of these experiments has inflicted
pain, beyond that of prompt decapitation, or division of the spinal marrow. 'This is true, at least, if the conclusion be correct, that when the head is re-
moved from the body, sensation and volition cease, whilst the reflex function
and the irritability alone continue; and it may be satisfactory to the humane
to know that the motions of the eel, for example, after the head is removed,
are not motions arising from sensibility, but from another principle, as distinct
from feeling as the irritability of the mere nervo-muscular fibre. This fact will
snggest the propriety, as well as the means of avoiding such monstrous cruelty
