But in the equation before us, aÞd'& (to a numerical factor pres) is *%***, and

(4+2r)—(28+t)=(q+2r+3s+4)—5(8+t)
=5(4—s+0). Hence the difference between the indices of s and » in each term is a multiple of 5,
and consequently, since the discriminant is a symmetrical function in s and y, it will be
a rational integral function of ©+7* and «xz. Moreover, as no such term as cd can figure
in the discriminant, which, as we know, must in all cases contain one or the other of the
two final and of the two initial coefficients, we see that no term can be of higher than
the 14th degree in s, x, nor yet 80 high, for the only terms that could be of that degree
would be be; but making « and F each zero in the original form, it becomes obvious

that all the terms free from @ and F contain be as a factor(*), Hence, in fact, the
discriminant will be only of the twelfth degree in s, 7, and being therefore of only the
8econd degree in &+7*, will admit of comparatively easy treatment.

(7) Before proceeding to the calculation of this discriminant, it will be useful to
investigate, as a Lemma ancillary to the subsequent discussion, under what conditions
four of the roots of the supposed equation will become imaginary when «=. In this case writing 7 +=, the equation

becomes

Z—2—2+1+9(2—1)+10f=2+(5:—1)z+10—5:—1=0,
or 8ay f2=0. The determinant of #(z) is thus (5:—1)*—402+ 20:+y, i. e. 5(L—s)(L+3z); and all
the roots of z, and consequently of (a, y), will be impossible, unless 2 lies between
1 and —4.
