The general relation between the river and the free water-table of our farm is demon-
strated in fig. 24, p. 356, as an eight-year mean for Roda Gauge and for Pit III. The

that the pit was deepened sufficiently to show water all the year round ; the first
complete record is available in fig. 23, for 1931. The failure of the pit to follow the river
