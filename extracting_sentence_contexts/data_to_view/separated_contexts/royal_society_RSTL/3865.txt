The clear liquid was again subjected to the
current, which it transmitted readily, and with the same phenomena as before. There could be little doubt that su{phocyanogen was the anion transferred in this
experiment. This part of our snbject still presents a tempting field for investigation,
from which however we were for a time diverted by an important class of facts which
next fell under our observation ; we have however since returned to the study, and
are at present engaged in researches upon the cobaltocyanides, and other double
cyanides, the results of which we hope ere long to lay before the Society. 6. We were purposing to follow up the examination of the double salts by the
electrolysis of other classes of these compounds, when we were stopped by the occur-
rence of a new order of phenomena, which it was necessary to turn aside and examine
as affecting the yery foundation of the process which we were employing.
