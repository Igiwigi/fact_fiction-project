line of the doublet ; they were, however, quite useless for taking the actual readings.
The device finally used to secure trustworthy observations consisted in levering open
the jaws of the slit to see the character of the lines and releasing the jaws in order to
take readings when the lines were seen to be narrow and luminous (without reversal).
This condition could sometimes be maintained during several minutes but was never
quite to be relied on; the reversal of the line could usually be detected even without
opening the jaws of the slit, by the loss of sharpness of the extinction and a sudden
change of perhaps 2° in the readings as the neighbouring line broadened and spread
into the field of view; this effect was particularly troublesome in the case of the less
refrangible line. The sodium lines were read without any prism on the eye-piece, as
the half-shadow angle could be reduced from 10° to 5° by removing this prism; this
exceptional course was justified (a) by the small amount of the stray light in the
grating spectrum (b) by the fact that the stray light would be practically a
continuous spectrum crossed by some scores of extinction bands and would not be
likely to deflect the extinction more in one direction than in the other ; the eye-piece
would not in any case have been adequate to throw out stray light from the other
sodium line.

A very promising method of producing a bright sodium spectrum without reversal
consisted in adding sodium salts to a silver are. But owing to the relative feebleness
of the light and the extremely trying character of the work of taking readings, the
attempt to utilise this method was finally abandoned.
