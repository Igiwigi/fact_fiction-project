and (4) 23871°3 (W.) or (5) 70°00 (R.), about equally displaced on either side of the
normal line.

Some space has been devoted to the consideration of the 8 series as on it depends
the determination of the important u, v links as well as the limit for the D series.
The latter is perhaps in general the more important as it affords with the F, the
means of obtaining accurate determinations of the oun. In the present case, however,
the measures have such large possible observation errors that they do not add to the
aceuracy already found in the foregoing discussion. A few points only will therefore
be here referred to. Both the D satellites for m = 1 and the F lines for m = 2 with
related lines form the majority of the lines in the long wave end of the spectrum
(n < 20000). One clue as to a distinction between the two sets may be found in
the fact that where the 5640 link occurs on a D line it links backwards, while in
the F it links forward. Consequently where a line has a link forward it is probably

not a D line, but is either a F line, or is attached to a D line (as in the 1864 set in X
attached to the D group near 20312). The D-qualification test with D (0) = 8 ()
can be applied to these suspected D lines, taking the 20438 as a definite D,, line.
That is the mantissa difference of the lines from that of 20438 must be an oun
multiple. A very large number are found to satisfy this test. It must be remem-
