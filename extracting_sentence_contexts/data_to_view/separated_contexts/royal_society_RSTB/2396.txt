not been able to detect any regularity of orientation of the sporangia. The sporangia are of an elongated form, as in Cyathea (fig. 93), the annulus is very
slightly oblique, and rather variable in its details ; it is continuous to the base, but
stops short at the insertion of the stalk, and does not pass continuously behind it, as
in Cyathea; nevertheless the sporangium is not symmetrical, the annulus being
usually slightly curved out of the plane, at the distal end. A comparison based on these facts leads to the conclusion that Diacalpe has a near
relation to Spheropteris, and that it is further removed than this genus from the
Cyathea type.
