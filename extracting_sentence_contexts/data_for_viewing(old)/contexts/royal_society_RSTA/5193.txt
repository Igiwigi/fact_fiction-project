adopted (known as secondary stabilization), which may include trenching, anchoring, placement
of mattresses or overweight clamps and/or rock dumping. Presently, each of these approaches
are known to provide reliable design solutions, but they come at a cost, with accounts suggesting
that stabilization comprises 30% of the cost of recent pipeline projects [1]. This is a substantial
amount given that the total capital cost of pipelines typically exceeds US $4 million per kilometre
of pipe [2].

Primary and secondary stabilization solutions are designed on the basis of conventional
design approaches, incorporating industry guidelines such as DNV-RP-F109 [3] and industry best
practices (e.g. [4]). However, it is widely accepted that these design approaches are simplified and : =
may be overly conservative on a sandy seabed, because they do not account for any variation 3
in pipeline embedment due to scour following the initial placement of the pipeline. This is
despite the fact that the same wave and current velocities that are evaluated to assess pipeline nee)
stability will almost always have the potential to mobilize sediment on a sandy seabed well before :
they can mobilize the pipeline [5]. A more correct stability analysis must therefore account for [4
scour of sediment from beneath the pipeline and the potential for pipeline lowering, which will DN
alter pipeline embedment and have a direct impact on hydrodynamic loading and lateral soil =
resistance. It is noted that previous work has incorporated changes to pipeline embedment into Ss
stability analysis (e.g. [6,7]), but this work has focused on changes in embedment due to cyclic .
loading of the pipeline as opposed to changes in embedment due to scour.

The detailed processes of pipeline scour and lowering have been described at length by

Fredsee et al. [8] and Sumer & Fredsge [9,10]. They are known to commence due to pre-existing
gaps under the pipeline or when a scour hole initiates beneath a pipeline due to ‘piping’
