gap: a challenge for the neuroeconomics of
decision-making under uncertainty. Phil.

The experimental investigation of decision-making in humans relies on
two distinct types of paradigms, involving either description- or experi-
ence-based choices. In description-based paradigms, decision variables

trial-by-trial feedback. In the decision-making literature, ‘description—
experience gap’ refers to the fact that different biases are observed in the
two experimental paradigms. Remarkably, well-documented biases of
description-based choices, such as under-weighting of rare events and loss
