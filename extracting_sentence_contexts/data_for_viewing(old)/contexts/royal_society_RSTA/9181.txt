MONOCLINIC DOUBLE SELENATES OF THE NICKEL GROUP. 227

Oleavage.—A. cleavage parallel to the orthoprism 7’{201} is well developed in the
erystals of all four salts of the nickel double selenate group. In addition, the
ammonium salt exhibits a feeble facility for cleavage parallel to the symmetry plane
b {010}. This second direction of cleavage has also been observed more perfectly
developed on the four double sulphates containing ammonium as the R-base and as
M-metals, magnesium, nickel, manganese, and copper. It would appear to be connected
with some obviously probable slight difference of structure, due to the different and
more complicated chemical nature of the ammonium, radicle NH, as compared with a
simple alkali metallic atom. It is a fact which may prove later of value in elucidating

~ the exact details of this slight difference of structure, and one which will require to
S be remembered in considering the meaning of the congruency with the rubidium salts
