However, strong differences are predicted further across the valley. Starting from about the centre of the valley, near-free-field sound propagation is predicted at
all octave bands for the rigid ground, while there is a much stronger reduction along the
grass-covered valley. Effects become increasingly pronounced with increasing sound frequency,
consistent with the fact that surface impedance decreases with frequency. These numerical
simulations indicate the importance of ground type in the case of ridge wind turbines emitting
sound into a valley. This behaviour deviates from wind turbine sound propagation above flat
ground, where the effects of ground type are typically much less pronounced [36].
