This is particularly important, as it would not be surprising if the
> elementary Coulomb approximation tended to become unsatisfactory for the heavier
= systems;t and it is desirable to know whether or not there is already a partial failure for K 1. ¢ Emphasis must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed the values of o? are
& extremely sensitive to the wave functions—either set of experimental results could be
8 reproduced by altering the values of n* derived from the term values by little over 1 part
in 100. There is little doubt, therefore, that, even for K1, the wave functions themselves are
5 remarkably accurate.§
