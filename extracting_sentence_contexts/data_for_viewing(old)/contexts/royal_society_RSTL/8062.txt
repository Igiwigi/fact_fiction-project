clusion that the distances from the centre of the various groups, as recorded by Scuwapr,
were not sufficiently precise to warrant very great refinement in the mode of estimating
the foreshortening. We have not therefore attempted to make use of Scuwapr's obser-
vations for the purpose of determining whether there be any law regulating the beha-
viour with regard to increase or diminution of the groups as they pass across the disk
of the un, such as we have elsewhere attempted to deduce from CarrINGToN's obserya-
tions, but we have confined ourselves to estimations of the spotted area of the whole
visible disk. !
We ought also to add that, in preparing our fortnightly mean values, those for the
days in which the sun's disk was not observed, were obtained by interpolation, 80 that
in Table V. the differences between the fortnights of Scawasr's series and simultaneous
fortnights of CanrixGroX's and of the Kew series may be partly accounted for by the
fact that the days of observations at Dessau were not the same as those in this country,
In fine, the differences registered in the Table include the uncertainty occasioned by
interpolation, as well as that occasioned by the method of observation.

27. In addition to fortnightly values we have given three-monthly values for every
fortnight, each of the latter being the mean of the three fortnightly values which
precede, and of the three which follow it.

We have given these three-monthly means in addition to the fortnightly means, inas-
much as our experience has led us to conclude that in the former while we get rid of
fluctuations of extremely small period, we yet preserve the most striking peculiarities
