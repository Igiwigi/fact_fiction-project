Note.—The class cogrd,,‘a does not include a itself (cf. *27°43), It will be noticed
that universal preservation of order by ranges in perspective on a pair of lines is a
characteristic of a pair of parallel lines in Euclidean space, and of nonsecant lines in
hyperbolic space. The choice of this property for the definition of parallelism (or
nonsecancy) arises from the facts that (1) any two coplanar objective reals are
copunctual (according to the subsequent axioms), so that the property of nonsecancy
(in its ordinary acceptation) is not available, (2) we do not wish to make “cogredience”

synonymous with “ nonintersection” (using “intersection” in the special sense here
defined), as this would impose an unnecessary limitation on the concept. The idea of
cogredience is an essential element in the definition of a relation which, with the aid
of axioms, distributes the points in any punctual line into an order. *20°42.
