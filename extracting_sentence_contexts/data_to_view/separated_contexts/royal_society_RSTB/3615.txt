There is nothing wrong with this method so long as the
observer remembers that he has destroyed this important structure, and does not
proceed to describe it as though he had respected its integrity. The criterion of
fixation must be the relation of the fixed material to the live picture, and, judged by
this standard, the wet fixation and passage into some mounting fluid is greatly to be
preferred. The criticisms that may be urged against the wet method are slight
shrinkage of the protoplasm of the body, and the fact that, as the attitude in three
dimensions has been very closely preserved, it is almost impossible in many cases to
get an accurate microscopic measurement of the length of the animal. The ordinary
methods of measurement supply no means whereby the elevation towards the eye of
the observer can be accurately estimated in the case of small objects of irregular
shape. Another drawback to the wet method is that all the parasites in a drop of
fluid may not adhere to the cover-slip ; it is clear that in certain kinds of work this is
â€œa very serious disadvantage.
