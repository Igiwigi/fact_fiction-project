Note that a great variation of
breakdown and switch fields is detected at 400 nm, at which the ‘mostly’ rhombohedral to mixed
thombohedral/tetragonal phase transition occurs, as mentioned above. Figure 7a-d depicts P-E loops obtained in PBLZST thin films. Low electrical hysteresis and
ferroelectric-like loops characterize the studied films, a fact attributed to a low antiferroelectric—
ferroelectric switch field. At temperatures above 53°C, P-E loops exhibited a leaky performance,
and for this reason, ECE in the 200nm PBLZST was measured indirectly within the 0-53°C
temperature span, as opposed to 0-120°C in the thicker films. ECE, i.e. temperature change (AT)
