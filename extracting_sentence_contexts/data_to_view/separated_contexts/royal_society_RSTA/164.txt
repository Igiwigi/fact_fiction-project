The effort required to convert a program
is minimal, and the process is well-documented. Since the geometry and resulting
rasters are generated separately on each node, VR JUGGLER has the advantage of
greatly reducing network traffic, compared with Curomium. In fact, the minimum
traffic required with VR JUGGLER is of the order of hundreds of bytes per frame,
which is unproblematic.

4. Application: histology image viewer

An OpenGL image viewer was created, which can load an image and render it on
the wall using VR Juccier. Application of compressed textures was also explored
as a way of reducing memory usage of the graphics cards, although this either
places a burden on the graphics cards at run-time (causing stuttering) or requires
a pre-processing step.
