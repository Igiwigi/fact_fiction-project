One of the
most famous machines of all times was built by Turing with just pencil and paper. Maynard Smithâ€™s point, in other words, amounts to saying that to understand embryonic

development we need a model or an algorithm that allows us to understand, at least in principle, : =
how a system can increase its own complexity in a convergent way. : >
Note that we do have a mathematical model that explains how a divergent increase in [3
complexity can take place. That model is provided by the equations of population genetics in : =
the presence of natural selection, and accounts for the fact that in the course of evolution living D8
systems gave origin to the increasingly diverging forms that make up the tree of life. But embryonic ia
development is a convergent, not a divergent, increase in complexity, and this is the key point that : =
any theory of development must explain. :3
As a matter of fact, we do have such a theory. It was proposed in The Organic Codes [7], and [3

here it is briefly summarized with a two-step procedure.
