sidered. Though e,, and w, are dependent on the gradient of u,, it is readily seen that
(apart from the fact that e,, = é,,) there exist a set of virtual changes of configuration
in which any one alone of all the variations involved in (1-71) is different from its value
in the change of configuration already considered.

' Suppose, for instance, that the variations 5w, in the virtual change already considered
have values 32, (3, % 2), Sey (1, Lp 2g), dug (7, 72 Xs), throughout the solid, de,, and
Sw, being determined from the gradient of 3%,, Su. 3u3, according to the formule
(1-22) and (1-23). Let us denote the values of the variations in the above virtual
change by the superscript 0, and the current co-ordinates by X,, X., X, while the
co-ordinates of P are 2, £2, 73. In a virtual change in which the displacement variations are
