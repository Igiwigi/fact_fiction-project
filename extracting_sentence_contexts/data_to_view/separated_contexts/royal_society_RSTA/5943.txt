Finally, we remark that figure 2 also explicitly indicates a pressure /shear decomposition of the
propagating relaxed micromorphic waves. This decomposition is obtained by writing equation
(2.3) in a reference system aligned with the direction of propagation considered (0째 and 45째,
respectively). In fact, given the correct choice of the reference system, equation (2.3) give rise
to two sets of uncoupled PDEs that can be interpreted as pressure and shear waves. Given
the chosen class of symmetry (tetragonal), this uncoupling is only possible for the 0째 and 45째
direction, while waves are coupled when considering intermediate directions. This means that
an analogous distinction between shear and pressure waves cannot be done for intermediate
directions.
