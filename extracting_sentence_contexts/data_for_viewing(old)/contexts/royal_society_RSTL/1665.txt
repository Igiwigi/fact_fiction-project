feet English, and when this is reduced to toises, we have for
the lengths of the three arcs from Lieut. Col. Mupcz's mea-
sures,

From Clifton to Dunnose 162067,g
Clifton to Arbury 70g80,2
Arbury to Dunnose 91687,1

These last values exceed those resulting from my compu-
tations, the first by 10 toises, the second by 2, the third by 8
toises; and these differences arise from the convergence of
the meridians, which the author thought might safely be neg-
lected, and in fact it does not make a difference that is percep-
tible in the value of a degree upon the meridian. For the
difference of 8 toises, in the distance between Dunnose 'and
Arbury, makes but 5 toises difference in the value of a degree
upon that arc, and the difference of 10 in the whole distance
from Dunnose to Clifton, makes 3E in the measure of each
degree on that arc. So that, as far as this source of disagree-
ment is concerned, the author's results and mine would not
be found to differ materially from each other.

-- But, if we attend to the angular dimensions of the several
arcs, as deduced from observation and from calculation, these
will not be found to agree 0 nearly.
