They were, in fact, ordinary zoospore nuclei in the process of
fusion. The sporangium was unusually large, and it may be that some accident
prevented the cleavage walls from forming. That, however, does not alter the fact
that intra-sporangial fusion of gametes took place in these few instances, an occurrence
which serves to strengthen the belief in the normality of fusion between gametes of the
same sorus. â€˜The wide question arises as to whether, in the particular case mentioned,
the organism under the stimulating effect of the presence of toxic substances may
not have had recourse to an earlier (? more primitive) method of sexual reproduction. It has often been stated that, in nature, sori are developed in spring, while
resting sporangia do not appear until late summer and autumn, by which time sori
are no longer to be found, and it is hinted that the difference in the temperature of
the seasons is responsible for the formation of one or other of the types of repro-
ductive bodies. That more sori are formed at the beginning of the season and more
resting sporangia at the end is certainly true, but resting sporangia may and do occur
quite early, and sori similarly may be found quite late.
