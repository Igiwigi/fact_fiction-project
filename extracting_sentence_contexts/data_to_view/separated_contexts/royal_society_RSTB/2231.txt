R. KENNEDY ON THE RESTORATION OF

return of normal motion in the paralysed moiety of the tongue, but if, on the
contrary, it was the central apparatus which determined the character of the move-
ment in the peripheral organ, then he expected to find movements of a rhythmic
type develop in the tongue. As a matter of fact he found after four months that
movements had developed on the surface and border of the tongue which could not
be taken for rudimentary or returning voluntary movements. ReicuerÂ® (12), who examined the animals at six months for Scutrr, reports that
in the affected moiety of the tongue there was no return of voluntary movements,
but that in their place were developed circumscribed areas of rhythmic movements
between which, and the movements of respiration, there was an unmistakable
relationship. He also described a series of vermicular movements occurring in the
posterior and middle thirds of the tongue during deglutition, and the same during
vomiting.
