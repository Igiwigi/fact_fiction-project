It is shown, moreover, by the experiments further on, upon timber, wrought iron, and
steel, that the strength of a pillar with one end round and the other flat, is always an
arithmetical mean between the strengths of pillars of the same dimensions with both ends
rounded and both flat, however the ratio of the strength of these may vary. We
see, too, by the first and second columns in the preceding abstract from Table IV.,
which contain the ratio of the strengths in pillars with discs, that their results are in
accordance with the rest. From these facts, as well as from other evidence not ad-
duced, I conclude that the above mean would always take place, however the fixed
ends were fastened. 17. The case of pillars fixed at one end and moveable at the other, is not without
its interest in practice; as piston rods of steam-engines and the rods of force-pumps
are instances of the use of materials in that form, it being the same thing in effect
whether the pillar be rounded at the end, or turn upon a joint there.
