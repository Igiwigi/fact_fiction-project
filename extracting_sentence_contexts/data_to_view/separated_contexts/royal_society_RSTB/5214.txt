The oral ambulacral plate differs from all the succeeding ambulacrals
(a) in being more massive. (b) in being bifurcated at the inner and expanded at the
outer extremity. ‘he first adambulacral plate on each side is laid down at the same
time as the third ambulacral plate and bridges the gap between the outer ends of
ambulacrals 2 and 3. The second pair of adambulacrals are also present in the imago
and each bears a short spine (fig. 25, B, ad.', ad*.).

(C) The Development of a Spine.—tn Asterina the spines are simple and develop in a
regular though simple fashion (Lupwia, 1882, Plate VIII, fig. 100); the base is always
a regular triradiate which later becomes hexaradiate. In Leptasterias it is a curious

fact that the part which is first formed is not the true base, but the part marked « in
fig. 26, c. The primordia of four different spines from the same larva are represented
in fig. 26 a and b to give some slight idea of the great irregularity which prevails. The
majority are either somewhat irregular six-rayed stars or tri- or tetraradiates.
