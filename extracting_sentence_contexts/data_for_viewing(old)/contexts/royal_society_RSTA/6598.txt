is marked by a short line on each radius. The elongation of the masses is, of course,
considerably greater in the section through the axis than in the other section. Each
mass is shaped somewhat like an egg, and the small ends face one another and come
very nearly into contact.

In the headings to the figures, amongst other numerical data, are given the square
of the angular velocity and the angular momentum of the system. The density of
the fluid being unity, the angular velocity # is given by the value of w°/4z; this is
the function of angular velocity which is usually given when reference is made to figures
of equilibrium of rotating fluid, such as the revolutional or Jacobian ellipsoids of
equilibrium. The moment of momentum of the system is given by reference to the
angular velocity of a sphere, of the same mass as the sum of our two masses, rotating
so as to have the same momentum. If, in fact, b be such a length that a sphere of
fluid of that radius has the same mass as our system (so that b? = a + A’), then the
moment of momentum is given by a number p in the expression (47)! b’ X pw. By this
notation the angular velocity and moment of momentum are made comparable with
the results given in a previous paper* on the Jacobian ellipsoid of equilibrinm.
From that paper the following table of the axes, angular velocity, and moment of
momentum of several solutions of JAcosi's problem is extracted.
