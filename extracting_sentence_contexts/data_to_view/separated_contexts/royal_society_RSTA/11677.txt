subject to the conditions p=q=s, p=rzs. It is clear that we must either have

(i) p=q=rz=s or (ii) p2=r>qzes;

and that these two systems do not overlap. If (i) obtains we may perform the summation ¥a?*!*"** by writing 7 = s+A,
q=s+A+B, p=s+A+B+C, where A, B, C are arbitrary positive integers, zero

and since C, B, A, s may each of them assume all values ranging from zero to infinity,
the sum is clearly

if, on the other hand, the parts of the partition have such values that (ii) obtains, we
may write

The fact is that the alternatives (i) and (ii) exist because there are two lattice
arrangements of wnequal numbers, and the signs of equality and inequality are
arranged in (i) and (ii) so that the required sum may be separated into two non-
overlapping systems in correspondence with the lattice arrangements. The fact that
