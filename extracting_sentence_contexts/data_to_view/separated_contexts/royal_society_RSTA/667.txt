It is also important to remember that
only three types of surfaces were tested in air, and one in water in these experiments; imagine all
the surface conditions and substrates a gecko encounters during its normal activities and what
the results of those experiments may yield [25]. The majority of gecko-inspired synthetic adhesives focus completely on adhesion, rather than
anti-adhesion (though see [64]) and other properties. In fact, most gecko-inspired synthetics only
mimic the fibrillar setal geometry, paying little attention to chemistry, material properties or even
context (ie. the adhesive environment), all of which appear to be important parameters in the
natural system. Remarkably, many of these synthetics perform well in laboratory conditions,
some of which even outperform the natural system in terms of adhesive performance (e.g. [65]). Yet, why do we not have a gecko-inspired adhesive that can resist high loads, attach and
detach with ease, self-clean, remove water, maintain material properties in variable environments,
and resist wear and deformation simultaneously?
