December 3, 1919; Experiments III and IV on January 22, 1920. Experiment III
was the least successful, as a number of the pieces died, and others did not
regenerate very much. In Experiment II the pieces were not kept in finger-bowls,
but in glass capsules containing only a small quantity of sea water.

Experiments in which the regenerated worms are properly and constantly fed will
be necessary before many of the problems presented can be solved, but the practical
difficulties of carrying out such experiments are considerable. Some points are,
however, clear from the results already obtained.

All the worms experimented on were large adults in which the modifications of the
segments which result in the formation of a stolon had already commenced, though
the stolon head itself had not yet begun to bud. It is a fact of great interest that
regeneration is most rapid and extensive in those segments which undergo normally
the greatest modification to form large swimming feet and dorsal cirri, commencing at
segment 20, and so far as regeneration of the anterior region is concerned with a
maximum in the region of segment 30. Experiment IV suggests that there may be a
second maximum as the tail region is approached (segments 46-51), and the final
segments in Experiment I also made a good growth anteriorly.

To what if any extent the rate or degree of regeneration is dependent upon the
number of segments in the original piece or upon the actual bulk of the original piece
is not clear from these experiments, though the good growth of segments 14-19 in
Experiment IV certainly suggests that the number of segments is important. On the
other hand the growth from segments 10 to 13 in Experiment IV is not as great as
