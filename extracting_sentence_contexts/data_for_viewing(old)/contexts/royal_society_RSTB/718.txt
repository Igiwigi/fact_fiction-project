of water present, also: I have not examined this point in much detail, but the
following facts may be noted. The lumps fall rapidly in alcohol, in distilled water,
and even in Pasrrur’s solution and other media of high specific gravity. Some idea
of the amount of water contained in the lumps may be derived from the following
observation :—On August 27th, I started a culture in a sterilised soda-water flask.
Five grams of the fresh Ginger-beer plant were put in 500 c.c. of Pasteur-Asparagin ;*
on September the 11th the carefully collected crop weighed, fresh, after draining on
filter paper, just over 52°5 grms, This, dried at 100° C. till it lost no more water,
weighed a trifle over 7 grms, Assuming the proportion of water to have been
the same in the original 5 grms., its dry weight would have been ‘66 grm.

Although the fresh dried lumps swell rapidly when placed in water, they do not
dissolve in it, even if boiled ; in fact, heating them in water renders them whiter and
more opaque, much us when they are placed in absolute alcohol, or dried in vacuo,

In most cases the fresh moist specimens, received by post from a distance, are
distinctly acid, though in varying degrees. In some specimens the acidity was
clearly due, in part at least, to acetic acid, owing to the presence of impurities to be
explained later on; but in others (perhaps in all) the acidity diminishes or even
disappears on boiling in water, and is easily shown to be due to the presence of
carbonic acid. The evanescence of the acid reaction to litmus, the effervescence when
hot water is poured on the moist lumps, and the precipitation of barium carbonate
