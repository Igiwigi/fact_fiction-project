Average number of branches per adult 341

Hence the average number of branches in the embryo is 9°4 per cent. greater than
in the adult. This may be expressed also as follows :—Supposing the embryos to
be taken as normal, then the adults should have 90 branches instead of 82
—or supposing the adults to be taken as normal, then the embryo should have
only 205 branches between them, whilst actually they have as many as 224. These
facts taken in conjunction with the appearance of degeneration of the collector noted
above seem to point conclusively to a reduction of the nervus collector during the
later life of the individual. Whilst considering the subject of the number of nerves in the collector, three
cases showing a somewhat remarkable variation must be noticed. The spinal nerves
in this region divided into two shortly after the junction of the anterior and posterior
roots, and each of the two divisions behaved as a separate nerve as far as the col-
lector was concerned (Plate 13, fig. 2).
