upon its renewal, only a feeble current will pass, not at all equal in force to what,
might be expected. Further, if P! and P? be connected by a metal wire, a powerful
momentary current will pass from P? to P! through the acid, and therefore in the

reverse direction to that produced by the action of the zinc in the arrangement ; and
after this has happened, the general current can pass through the whole of the System as
at first, but by its passage again restores the plates P? and P! into the former opposing
condition. This, generally, is the fact described by RiTTer, Martanini, and Ds 1a
Rivs. It has great opposing influence on the action of a pile, especially if the latter
consist of but a small number of alternations, and has to pass its current through
many interpositions. It varies with the solution in which the interposed plates are
immersed, with the intensity of the current, the strength of the pile, the time of
action, and especially with accidental discharges of the plates by inadvertent contacts
or reversions of the plates during experiments, and must be carefully watched in
every endeayour to trace the source, strength, and variations of the voltaic current.
Its effect was avoided in the experiments already described (1036. &c.), by making
contact between the plates P! and P? before the effect dependent upon the state of the
s0lution in contact with the zinc plate was observed, and by other precautions.
