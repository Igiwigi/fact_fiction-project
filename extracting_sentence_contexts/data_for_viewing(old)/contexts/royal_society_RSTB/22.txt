PRIORITY IN THE ORDER OF MovemeEn's. (See fig. 7.)

We may now return with advantage to a detailed consideration of Axiom 1, viz.,
that the larger muscles are represented in the upper part of the motor area for the
upper limb, while the smaller ones have their centres in the lower part of that area.


MINUTE ANALYSIS OF CORTICAL CENTRES. 163

It seemed to us highly important, as bearing on this point, to note the order of
movement of the different segments of the limb,—in fact, the “march,” as it has been
termed by Dr. Hucuiines Jackson, of the nerve discharge,—since we consider that
a complete series of observations of this kind would enable us to construct a definite
scheme which would show at a glance where certain primary movements are really
centralised.

By this we mean that we applied the electrodes to the cortex just long enough to
evoke movement in one joint only, and then noted which moved first, and in what
direction. This first movement we considered to be the primary or fundamental
movement in the given portion of cortex stimulated. (The current employed in every
case was only just adequate to produce such movement, and the secondary coil
was usually 10 cm. distant from the primary coil.)
