Diffusion—It is well known that when two unequally heated portions of the
ame liquid, or of two miscible ones are mixed, a state of thermal equilibrium between
the two is established, and a temperature results intermediate between those of the
mixed liquids, and dependent upon their temperatures, Mas8es, and capacities for heat. If snch experiments stood alone, it would be difficult, either by the dynamic or the con-
ditional theory of heat, to disprove the assertion that no interchange of heat takes place
between particle and particle, —that each particle maintains its original temperature,
and that, being mutually diluted, the effect (for instance on the mercury of a thermo-
meter) is the resultant of two unequal but continual efforts.

mutual interpenetration, shows that the first method of heat equalization may and does
take place. The question, however, still remains :—Ts the equalization of temperature
instantaneous when two liquids of unequal temperature are perfectly mixed? When a
vessel of cold water is placed over a flame, may not the water at the bottom which has
the temperature of the bottom, diffuse into the colder water without immediately losing
its temperature*?
