into sines and cosines, and a single series multiplied by an exponential factor into the
sum of two 8eries multiplied respectively by a sine and a cosine, changes considerably
the appearance of the results, which, from an analytical point of view, are less simple
when the differential equation is of Bessers form. The principal case considered
in the theory of Brssr1/s Functions is that of Â» = an integer: this corresponds
to the case of p = an integer +}, which is generally excluded in this memoir, as
it renders certain of the particular integrals infinite ($ T., arts. 1, 3). The case of

finite solution corresponds in (1) to p = an integer and in Brsser's equation to
y = an integer +4. The fact that BesseL's function J'(z) is exprexsible in a finite
form when y=i+4, and the finite expression itself, are well known, and the case is an
important one in physical investigations ; but, 0 far as I know, the recommencement
of the series after the zero terms has not been specially noticed in connexion with the
subject of BessEL's Functions.

The eighth (and last) section contains a list of writings the contents of which are
closely connected with the subject of the memoir, arranged in order of date and classed
under the sections in which they are noticed. There is also in each case a short
account of the portion of the paper for which it has been referred to, with the numbers
of the articles in which the references occur. The section does not contain a list of
all the papers referred to in the memoir; only those papers which are closely connected
with it, and portions of which are, in most cases, to some extent reproduced in it,
