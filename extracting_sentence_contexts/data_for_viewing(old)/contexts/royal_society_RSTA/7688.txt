ments at the two laboratories differed by 4 x 10째 and not 1 x 10째 as a bare
statement of the above results might suggest. On the other hand, it is also known
that the values accepted for the International Ohm in 1936 at each of the Laboratories
did not differ by as much as 1 x 10째, so that the differences between the last three
results are those between the absolute measurements. The N.P.L. values obtained
in 1914 and 1936 are the same within the experimental error, and it is not possible
to attach any significance to the difference between the corresponding two values
given in Table VI.

The relation between the International Ohm and the ohm is shortly to be discussed
by the Committees of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, who will
probably have additional data, and there would therefore be little point in attempting
a full discussion at this juncture. The most significant facts arising from the work
of the National Physical Laboratory are that it has been possible to determine
an absolute unit of resistance by two different methods, with agreement within
1 part in 10째, and that measurements made over a period of more than 20 years have
agreed within the estimated limits of error, which are smaller than those involved
in the establishment of the International Ohm as at present defined. With the
Campbell method in particular all the readings can be obtained with a precision
that is seldom equalled in any electrical measurements, and there can be no question
that apparatus of this kind provides a far more satisfactory means of obtaining a
unit of resistance than the standard mercury tube.
