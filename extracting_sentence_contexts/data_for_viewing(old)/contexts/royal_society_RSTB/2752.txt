the information that the women of her race only had children about March, that is, immediately after the
wet season, and that each woman normally had a child every year at this season, as long as she was
capable of child-bearing.”

Iam indebted to Messrs. ANNANDALE and Roprnson for permission to make use of this very interesting
information, which, so far as I am aware, is among the most direct evidence of a restricted sexual season
in a primitive race. (Cf. “ Fasciculi Malayenses, Anthropology,” Part I, now issued.—May 15th.)

+ It is possible that the follicle referred to was not sufficiently advanced towards maturation to admit
of rupture, since it did not show any indication of atresia, so far as I observed. But this may quite well
be explained by the fact that the ewe was killed only on the day following the detection of cestrus, and
possibly but a few hours after the termination of that estrus; so that the follicle might not have begun
to degenerate. I am unable to state when the polar bodies are extruded in the case of the sheep.

the histological appearance of the atretic follicle described in the preceding experi-
ment made it probable that it had undergone degeneration owing to insufficiency of
stimulus when in a condition for ovulation. Numerous cases, however, of follicles
becoming atretic before, and usually a considerable time before, attaining their
maximum development have come under my observation.
