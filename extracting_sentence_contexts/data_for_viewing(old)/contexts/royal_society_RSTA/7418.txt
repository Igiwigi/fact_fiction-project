510 R. A. RANKIN ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY

From the above remarks on f, n? and it is clear that the magnitudes of the variations
possible during burning cannot be stated definitely in any detail since they depend to a
considerable extent upon the design and performance of the particular rocket under con-
sideration. For some designs the variations may be small, while for others they may be
appreciable. In the latter case the justification for the assumption of no variation rests on
the fact that it is in the initial stages of flight, while the velocity is subsonic, that the variation
is least, and it is during this period that the greater part of the deviation of the rocket is,
in general, built up, the motion during the later stages of burning consisting mainly of
oscillations of decreasing amplitude about a fixed angular deviation. Accordingly, the values
of f, n? and f at launch may be taken as the constant values. This argument does not, of course,
apply when the launching velocity is in the region of the velocity of sound, or when the
variations mentioned are large. In such cases the solutions obtained under the assumptions
cannot be expected to be valid approximations, particularly if the stability is critical, and
it may be necessary to split up the trajectory into a number of arcs in each of which the
assumptions hold.

Neglect of damping terms. Damping of the oscillations is due to two causes: (i) the effect
of the burning gases ejected from the projectile, and (ii) the-effect of certain of the aero-
