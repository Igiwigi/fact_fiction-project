That the focus that has thus been eliminated in the anterior composite and prorean.
gyri is probably the true abductor cortical centre for the vocal cords, is made more
likely by the fact that it is precisely in the same region in the cat’s brain that
this effect is to be obtained. The only difference being that in the cat abduction
of the cords can always be evoked on cortical excitation whether the adductor
fibres in the recurrent laryngeal nerves be intact or not, whereas in the dog it is
sometimes necessary to divide the adductor fibres in one recurrent nerve before it is
possible to elicit abduction on exciting the cortex. This would appear to signify that
in the cat the cortical centres for abduction and adduction are more equally balanced,
and that there is not the preponderance of the adductor centre over the abductor as
in the case of the dog ; in fact there is rather a preponderance of the abductor over
the adductor. The relative position which I have ascribed to the abductor centre, as compared
with the adductor, is in accord with the results which Horsiry and Semon obtained
on exciting the fibres of the internal capsule, for they place the fibres, excitation of
which gave rise to abduction of the vocal cords, in front of those which, when excited,
resulted in adduction of the cords. That these observers found such fibres in the
internal capsule of the dog and monkey, as well as in the cat, excitation of which
evoked adduction of the vocal cords, appears to me to be strong presumptive evidence
that a focus exists in the cortex of the dog and monkey, as well as in the cat,
excitation by which is responsible for abduction of the vocal cords.
