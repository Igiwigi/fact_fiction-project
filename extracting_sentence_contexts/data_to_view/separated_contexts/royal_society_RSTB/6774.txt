When elastic recovery has
restored the original equilibrium (at pachytene) pairing ceases. â€˜THE PHENOMENON OF SUPERCONTRACTION

Two further pieces of indirect evidence may be quoted in support of the inter-
pretation of meiosis outlined in the previous section. The first is the well-known fact
that the most striking other case of a chromosome in a state of exceptional elongation,
that of the salivary glands of the Diptera, also shows chromosome pairing in an extreme
degree. No explanation, either biological or physical, can generally be advanced for
this behaviour in such a tissue. If, however, chromosome elongation and chromosome
pairing are causally connected the matter becomes intelligible if not explained.
