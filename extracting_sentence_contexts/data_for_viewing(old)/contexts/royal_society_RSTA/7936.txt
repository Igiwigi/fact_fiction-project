Starting at rest with polygons orientated as shown in fig. 12 a, and considering the
shear increasing, the next stage is 12 6, followed by 12c, at a shear corresponding to a
plate speed of between 0-5 and 1 cm./sec. Patterns 126 and 12¢ are seen together in
fig. 6. No. 12 c is placed after 12 b, 7.¢., at a greater shear, since 12 ¢ and 12 d appear
together in fig. 7, taken at 1 cm./sec. On the right-hand side of fig. 7, can be seen the
type e—the polygon chains. This pattern appears also in fig. 8, taken at about 1-5
em./sec., together with types f and g. The pattern gis shown in fig. 9, taken at a greater
speed. Thus the order of appearance of the patterns e, f and g is determined.

Tt is seen that the transverse rolls are not part of the scheme; the fact that they
were generated independently and could not be transformed from anything else confirms
this ; there is also the fact that at a speed of 0-5 cm./sec., both the transverse rolls and
the pattern b were obtainable according to whether the pattern started ab initio or
whether it started from a. The transverse rolls appear, therefore, to occupy a unique
position in the series of patterns. The fact that the transverse rolls have not yet been
obtained in a liquid lends further support to the statement.

Attention is drawn to the obvious pairing of the rolls. It appears that whatever
the form of the pattern, the air layer is divided into cells, completely closed, with
descent in the centre of each.
