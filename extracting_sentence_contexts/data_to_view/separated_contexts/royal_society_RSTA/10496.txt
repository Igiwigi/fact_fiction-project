This is due to the fact that with a lower potential fall a
longer time is required before the stationary condition is reached than with a higherâ€™
one, and if before an experiment is started a little diffusion takes place at the point
where gelatine and aqueous solutions are in contact, it is possible that the margin
may have travelled right through the tube before it has become visible. The production of a refraction boundary in the case that the slower ion precedes

But if at the beginning of such an experiment the concentrations of the two solutions
ave proportional to the transport numbers of the respective cations (or anions), then a
stable boundary results which travels with the current. Such a ratio of concentration
is automatically brought about during electrolysis, when the slower ion follows the
faster, and once this condition is established the margin so produced may be made to
move backwards by altering the direction of the current, and this may be repeated a
number of times without losing the boundary, although its velocity has been proved
by experiment to be less in the backward than in the forward direction, The
stability of this margin is easily understood from the fact that the potential slope in

the two solutions is so adjusted that the velocities of the two ions is the same, This
is, however, only strictly true for what may be called the reverse direction, for the
first moments after reversal of the current, since the change in potential slope no
longer hinders diffusion between the two solutions, but aids it, and hence the

resistances become altered, and so also the potential fall and the velocity.
