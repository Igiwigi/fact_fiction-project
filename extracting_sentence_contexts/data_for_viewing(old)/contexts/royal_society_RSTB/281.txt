previously existing electromotive force (in the language of pu Bois-Reymonp, a
negative variation of the leaf current).

On this question, much light has been thrown since the publication of my last paper
by the progress of experimental investigation in animal physiology, and particularly by
the investigation of the electromotive properties of the ventricle of the heart of the Frog.
It was first demonstrated by Donpxrs, that the muscular surface of the ventricle when
at rest is equipotential, and that electrical inequalities between different parts only
manifest themselves either when one or both parts are in a state of excitation, or, in
the absence of this condition, when the two parts are in different states of physiological
activity. In 1883, I investigated these phenomena with reference to their time
relations, and subsequently succeeded in recording them photographically. With
reference to the surface of the ventricle, I was able to show (1) that all the facts are
comprised in the statement that relative positivity of any point of that surface is the
concomitant or sign of the physiological endowment of susceptibility of excitation,
and (2) that the effect of excitation or injury is to diminish that condition, the degree
of diminution increasing with the degree of pre-existing positivity; or, more briefly,
that the excitable tissue enjoys the faculty of undergoing a change towards relative
negativity whenever it is interfered with in such a way as either to excite or injure it.
Beyond such a statement as this, which involves no physical theory whatever of the
nature of the observed relation, it is not, in my judgment, possible to proceed at
present. In so far as the so-called theory of pre-existence can be brought within such
a definition, I accept it, in preference to the other way of putting it (the “alteration
theory”), according to which, devitalised or injured parts are negative, because they are
not alive enough, and excited parts negative, because they are too alive.
