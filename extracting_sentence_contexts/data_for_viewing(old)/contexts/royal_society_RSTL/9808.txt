Echinus is now no longer able to escape from injury, but when stimulated crawls
indifferently. in any direction, Thus, removal of the nerve-centre seriously impairs the
activity of the pedicels, and totally destroys their co-ordination. Yet when specimens
80 mutilated are inverted, one out of every four specimens is able to right itself. This,
however, is only done with great difficulty and after a long time, 80 that, under these
circumstances, the execution of this manceuvre seems to be just barely possible. Still
the fact of its being possible at all proves that the integrity of the nerve-centre is not
absolutely essential to its performance. Therefore, as experiment has failed to reveal
to us any other general nerve-centre in the animal, and as even a segment of the
animal containing only a single row of pedicels is in many cases able to perform this
mancenvre, we conclude, as already stated, that the action of the pedicels is partly of
a serial character, though largely assisted by the co-ordinating influence that emanates
from the nerve-centre.

The effect of this operation upon the spines and pedicellarize still remains to be
considered. No effect at all is produced upon the pedicellariz ; but upon the spines a
profound influence is seen to be exercised. Their spontaneity, indeed, remains un-
impaired, as does also the function which they share with the pedicellariee of closing
round any instrument of stimulation ; likewise their power of responsive bristling all
