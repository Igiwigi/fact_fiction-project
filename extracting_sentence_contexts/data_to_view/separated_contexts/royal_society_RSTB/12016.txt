As

synaesthetic concurrent of the letter ‘S’ (‘T’), hence creating inter- interference should only apply to synaesthete participants. Fur-
ference between the subjectively perceived non-veridical colour thermore, differential effects are to be expected in synaesthetic
of this specific letter and the actual colour in which the stimulus participants for Go and NoGo trials. This is based on the fact that
was presented. For participant 1, for example, ‘A’/’A’s were pre- for NoGo trials, the stimulus feature ‘identity’ essentially becomes
sented in yellow instead of the synaesthetically perceived red, task-irrelevant (A or E), as inhibition is required in response to the
and ‘E’/’E’s in blue instead of orange (see figure 5). Hence, an letters’ ‘shape’ (bold italics versus normal font) disregarding its
‘idiosyncratic conflict’ between the objectively presented colour presented ‘identity’.
