R. ROBINSON ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANTHOCYANINS 155

are analogous to the Dazzler forms of Primula sinensis. This is in fact known to be so
in Papaver Rhoeas (Scott-Moncrieff 1936). Therefore, subject to certain assumptions, the only conclusion which can be drawn
from the evidence of mixed anthocyanidin derivatives is that cyanidin is the antho-
cyanidin whose synthesis in the plant involves at least one stage less than that of either
pelargonidin or delphinidin (scheme C). LEucO-ANTHOCYANINS

Since the colours of flowers and fruits, in attracting insects and birds, play an
important part in the reproduction of the species, it is clear that natural selection,
following upon variation, will operate to perpetuate and increase the number of
colour types adaptable to reproductive needs.
