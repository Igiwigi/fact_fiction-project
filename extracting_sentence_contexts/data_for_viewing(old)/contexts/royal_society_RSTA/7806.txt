1. INTRODUCTORY SURVEY

It is now well over eighty years ago since Barr√© de Saint-Venant reduced the
problem of the beam of constant cross-section under the action of a single transverse
load to the search for plane harmonic functions satisfying a certain condition round
the boundary of the cross-section. The solutions due to Saint-Venant, which in-
clude the rectangular, elliptic and circular cross-sections, are all cases in which the
cross-sections have two axes of symmetry at right angles, meeting of necessity in the
centroid of the cross-section, and along these axes the single transverse load is resolved.
These axes are principal axes, and his solution depends upon this fact. Some less useful!
solutions exist for the load along one axis of certain beams of such bi-axial symmetry
of cross-section, the solutions not yet being known for the load along the perpendicular
axis.

162 A. C. STEVENSON ON FLEXURE WITH SHEAR AND TORSION

In the case of cross-sections with a single axis of symmetry, when the forces across the
end-section reduce to a load with a resolute transverse to the axis of symmetry, the
solution of the flexure problem is known (Love 1927, p. 332) to involve also the solution
