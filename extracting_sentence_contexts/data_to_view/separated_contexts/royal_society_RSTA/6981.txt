Above o, one should observe only the linear law
(59); below o,, all the rates of growth between (58) and (59) could be expected. As far as
we know there is no experimental evidence for such a critical supersaturation. On the other hand, we observe frequently (Bunn 1949; Humphreys-Owen 1949) that
the rate of growth is substantially smaller than the linear law (59) would suggest; sometimes
a crystal surface does not grow at all in spite of the fact that it is in contact with supersatura-
tions as large as ¢ ~ 0-1. This could possibly be interpreted as being due to the absence of
dislocations in the surface or to the presence of so many that the mean distance between them
is smaller than 2p,. In this last case, the number of dislocations per sq.cm. would have to
be of the order of 10'2cm.~®, which is high.
