The one
supposes that it furnishes an internal secretion analogous to that of the thyroid, and that it may act
vicariously for the last-named gland. This opinion has been supported by experiments in animals, in
which the thyroid has been removed, and from cases of cachexia thyreopriva in man.* In certain of these
cases alterations have been noticed in the epithelial part of the pituitary body, and there have been
described in it the development of cysts or vesicles occupied by fluid, which is said to resemble the
“colloid” of the thyroid vesicles. But, in view of the fact that such cyst-like cavities occur normally in
the pituitary, and further that many other organs besides the pituitary undergo alterations in character
after thyroidectomy, one would hesitate to accept this evidence as sufficient to support the theory. In
any case, whether true or not, the function which this view ascribes to the pituitary would be confined to
the epithelial tissue of the gland, and could have nothing to do with the infundibular part, in which alone
the active agents which influence the circulation and renal secretion are found. The second view supposes the pituitary body to have some ill-defined influence upon the nutrition and
growth of the extremities and especially of the bones.
