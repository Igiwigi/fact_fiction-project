We proved also that the system of curves A’ consists in this case of all the
conics of the plane (each of these being augmented by the line XY repeated). There
are only two possible H-nets of these, namely the lines of w each augmented by a fixed
line, and an ordinary H-net of conics; these lead to a quadric-quadrie and a quadric-
quartic transformation respectively.

prime, and contain a conic touching IL at a point of 1—Dxt Pxzzo devotes one of his

* We pointed out earlier that any quadrie which contains a line 4 of the surface I touches that surface at
three points of 2; and if then we make it touch I at a fourth point of 4, it will do so at every point of
the line.

papers entirely to this transformation* which is, in fact, the only one worked out by him
for four dimensions. It is associated from our point of view with the net of lines of the
plane w as we remarked above. But from the analytical point of view it is as simple as
could be.
