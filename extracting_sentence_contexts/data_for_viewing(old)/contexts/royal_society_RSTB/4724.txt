Kossonogorr} has advanced a theory of “optical resonance” in which he assumes
that all the colours of Lepidoptera are due to the selective reflection of minute
granules said to exist between the strie of every scale. He appears to have
measured the size of these granules, maintaining that the wave-length of the
coloured light reflected from the scales is a function of their diameter. Apart
from the fact that many wing pigments can actually be extracted,§ he admits
that he was unable to measure the diameter of single granules, but was obliged to
assume that the size of the granules was uniform and equal to the distance
between them. It is hardly necessary to add that many scales are perfectly
transparent, and devoid of all granular matter.

BrepERMANN describes a structure in the wing-cases of many beetles analogous
to the prismatic formation in Sapphirina. He finds the following structures in all
beetles :-—

(1) A thin cuticle, on the surface of which is a network (“ Wabenwerk,”)
corresponding to the ends of (2) a layer of parallel rods or columns (“‘Stdibchenschicht”)
set at right angles to the surface of the elytron, and seen through the cuticle.
