This discordance will be more conclusively shown if we express the observed variations
Sin the form of the series (2) described hereafter (17), when the coefficients of the second
Eand following terms should be zero, while we find that those of the second and third A terms have magnitudes not greatly inferior to the coefficient of the first term. Again, it will be shown hereafter (19) that there should be no mean diurnal yaria-
tion for the whole year due to direct action of the sun, while in fact there is such a
yariation of very considerable range, in middle and high magnetic latitudes, which is
opposite in character for the north and south magnetic hemispheres. With respect to the direct action of the sun upon the observed magnets, the first of
the above-mentioned reasons was adduced by Dr. LLoyp as showing the inconsistency
with observation in the law of the diurnal variations as derived from the theory in ques-
tion, in a paper published in the * Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, February
22, 1858. The same conclusion is here extended by the aid of Po1ss0Nn's formula to
the inducing action of the sun upon the 8oft iron of the earth.
