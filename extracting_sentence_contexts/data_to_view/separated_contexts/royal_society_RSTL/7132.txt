The chief arguments by which this view is snpported are derived from the observations
(1) that it is very rarely that the indices of the prime factors of chemical symbols have
a common measure ; (2) that on this assumption the &ymbols of hydrogen, water, and per-
oxide of hydrogen constitute a series of the form &, «&, «£2; and that the densities of
these substances form an arithmetical progression, being 1, 9, 17; and that s8nch series
80 frequently occur in the actual system of chemical symbols as to render probable their
existence in the future system. The conclusions at which we thus arrive are not to be regarded as necessarily final. Not only is it possible that further information as to the chemical properties of the per-
= oxide of hydrogen might lead us to the adoption of a more complex symbol, but we can
&@ even specify the very facts, the discovery of which would induce us to modify our opinion. But, nevertheless, the choice of the expression «£? as the symbol of the unit of this 8ub-
stance is not an arbitrary and conventional selection.
