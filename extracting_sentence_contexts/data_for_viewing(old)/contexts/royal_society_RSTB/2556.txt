barriers that would not interfere with the Tetrabelodonts.

The fact that no remains of Proboscideans have been found in any pre-Miocene
deposit of Europe, Asia or North America shows clearly that the group cannot have
originated in any of those continents, but must have arisen on some adjacent land-
area, from which also several other families, appearing for the first time in the
European Miocene, may have been derived, and various speculations as to the position
of this land-area have been put forward. Among later writers the hypothesis that
the Ethiopian region was the centre of distribution of the Proboscidea has been
formulated most distinctly by Srenii* and Ossorn,t both of whom consider that not
only the Proboscidea, but also a number of other groups such as the Hyracoidea, the
