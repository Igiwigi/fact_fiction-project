principally that which takes place in the contact of the arterial blood with the mus-
cular fibre, is in all probability the source of this electricity in the museles. I will
not here repeat all the many and minute researches, together with the precautions I
took, in the numberless experiments attempted in order to exclude eyery possible
cause of a current foreign to the muscle; and nobody who has taken the pains to
follow out the description of my experiments, can retain any doubt that the origin of
the muscular current is in the muscle endued with a certain degree of vitality. The
experiments referred to, making the pile act in vacuum, in hydrogen, in oxygen,
and in carbonic acid, prove with full evidence that it is not the action of the gas
upon the inner surface of the muscle which occasions the current. To remove
all possible doubt, I have taken the precaution of preparing the half thighs of frogs
with gilded scissors or with pieces of glass made sharp at the edges ; the mus-
cular current was the same, as in fact it ought to have been, as indeed it should have
been.

It might be said, reasoning according to a theory the value of which is well-appre-
ciated at the present day, that the cause of the muscular current resides in the con-
tact between the inner and the outer part of the muscle, or in other words, of two
heterogeneous bodies. Let this then be the simplest interpretation of all the facts
discovered by myself ; it is 8ufficient for me to have well-established that this contact
of heterogeneous parts of the muscle generates electricity in the conditions discovered,
and such as they are described in the results referred to above.

With regard to my own opinion, it appears more satisfactory to say that the deve-
lopment of electricity takes place in the muscle during life from the chemical action
