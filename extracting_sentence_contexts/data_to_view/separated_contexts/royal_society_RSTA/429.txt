The calibration was performed in situ. Furthermore, unlike in most torsion balance experiments, the calibration was performed in the
same mode, i.e. the configuration of the experiment remained the same. Another interesting
aspect of this experiment is the fact that the calibration takes advantage of gravitation itself. The
gravitational force between a known mass and the Earth was used. This is in contrast to torsion
balances, which are often calibrated using electrostatic forces.

(b) Nonlinearity

In 1995, Kuroda pointed out [28] a nonlinear effect in torsion balances that could lead to a
significant systematic bias in the so-called time of swing method.
