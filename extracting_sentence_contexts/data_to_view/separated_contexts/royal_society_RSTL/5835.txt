By
careful observation it may be distinctly seen that both at the attached portion (e) and
the free floating portion (#) the band is 8mall and the current single. Tt will now be
; understood that the double currents, setting in opposite directions, which are seen when
the middle third of the tube (7, g, h) is in focus, result from the folding of the tube upon
itself. Insignificant as this point may seem, it involves in truth the important questions
whether the segmental organ be single or double, whether it carries one current or two,
whether in fact it consists of a simple siphon leading out of the general cavity, or of a
complex apparatus adapted at once to excrete and to renew the chylaqueous fluid. The
8olution of this problem involves great care and patience. < At its free internal extremity (A, 6), this organ is held in a determinate position by

means of bridles of delicate threads fixed at (4).
