The tissue is a very peculiar one. I have not succeeded in discovering any
structure absolutely identical with it elsewhere than amongst these Carboniferous plants. T have already referred, both in my preceding memoir (Part IL.) and in the present, one,
to the fact that transverse sections of this prosenchymatous layer of the bark exhibit the

& cells arranged in regular radiating lines proceeding from within outward, as in the wood
8 of the Conifere. On seeing such sections, it is difficult to resist the impression that we

S of the persistent petioles, except that in transverse sections of the latter we find the
Z position of the central vascular bundle very distinctly marked, as in the scars of the
& ordinary Lepidodendrya.
