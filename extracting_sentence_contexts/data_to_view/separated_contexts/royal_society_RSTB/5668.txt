(13) The Behaviour of the First Younger Primordium. The fact that the centre of the first primordium after the isolated primordium was
never displaced, can readily be understood. For the central part of that primordium
was situated in a depression between two older leaves (see fig. 9), and the parts of these
leaves with which it was in contact were not touched by the cut. Consequently, the
centre of the first primordium would not be expected to be displaced.
