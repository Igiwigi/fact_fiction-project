dislocation line with successively larger values of x, continue to arrive at a point in the plane
x, = 0 ever afterwards. We may try to find the equation of motion by the energy argument
used for the point singularity or by tapering the dislocation in the manner of figure 1Â¢ and
requiring that the external and self-forces should balance. Owing to the way in which the
dislocation is haunted by its past we obtain an integral equation of motion, or equivalently
a differential equation of infinite order.

The problem is even more intractable in the case of an arbitrary dislocation loop. The
integral now extends only over a finite time interval but has a more involved spatial
dependence and is complicated by the existence (in the isotropic case) of two velocities of
wave propagation. Moreover, the problem is not simply one of translation of the loop; we
have to find its change of form as a function of time. It is perhaps not worth while pursuing
this problem until it is decided whether the motion of a dislocation is in fact governed by
inertia (Frank 1949) or by quasi-viscous forces (Leibfried 1950).
