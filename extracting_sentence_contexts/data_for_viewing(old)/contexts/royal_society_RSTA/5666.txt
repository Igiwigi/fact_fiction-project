Here, the energy flux 6 expresses nonlinear energy exchanges between different fluctuation : =

where u and R are the exact solutions from the statistical equations. While the mean and
covariance dynamics in (2.3a) and (2.3b) are not explicitly written in terms of E, we found that
by allowing the unresolved components in (2.3b) to depend on E, one can achieve an effective
non-Markovian closure model, especially for reduced-order model building upon the coupled
system (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.5) in leading modes [28].
