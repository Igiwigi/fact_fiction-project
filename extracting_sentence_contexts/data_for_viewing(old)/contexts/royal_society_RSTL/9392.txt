for twenty-four hours, we found on the 24th of August that the magnetization fell from
a normal value of 685 down to 550 as the result of twisting it to +260, then to
—260, and then to zero of torsion. The second application of positive and negative
torsion reduced the magnetization further to 534, It is curious to find that not

merely does torsion diminish the magnetization temporarily, but that it leaves 80 large
a permanent diminution. Whether this permanence is absolute in respect to time or
not is an interesting question to be s8olved by leaving a wire which has been thus dealt
with absolutely quiescent from day to day, month to month, year to year, century to
century. It seems, however, that but slight mechanical disturbance suffices to shake
ont the diminution of magnetization left at the end of each of these experiments.

228. The general lagging of effect is shown by the fact that in every ascending
branch the curve is lower than in the immediately previous descending branch ; and
the dotted latter halves of the long curves of the Diagrams XXIV. to XXIX. show,
by the intersections of their convex portions near the zero, that if the experiment was
continued long enough, the history of the variation of magnetization would in every
case be represented by a curve like that in the annexed sketech,

229. A very interesting discovery of WIEDEMANN's (*Galvanismus,” $491 and 498), at
firsb sight, seemed to find its explanation in the aeolotropic difference of magnetic
