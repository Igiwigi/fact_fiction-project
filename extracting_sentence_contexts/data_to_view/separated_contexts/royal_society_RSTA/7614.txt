Frequency is plotted along the vertical lines. The

variables YJ, }, along the other two axes. It is necessary to emphasize here that the fact that an =

that the surface runs * flat” at a certain point, and not necessarily that the density
of the normal vibrations is a maximum at that point.t It may as often indicate a
minimum, Nevertheless, these points form a very useful starting point for the
consideration of where the maxima are likely to be, and are certainly associated
with maxima in some cases, e.g., the maximum in the lower frequency branch in
the case of one particle per cell discussed in § 2.
