Gusii approach of using more tactile contact and gestural com-
munication may be more typical around the world than the
North American approach, which emphasizes eye contact
and verbal communication. An excessive focus on eye gaze
as the key element in joint attention (e.g. [56]) may twist the
scientific understanding of joint attention by underestimating
its prevalence in societies where eye gaze is less important
than in North American contexts.

Rather than the narrowly Western-centric cue of eye gaze,
vocal and postural behaviours may represent a more culturally
generalizable set of cues for the study of infant social cognition
[53]. In fact, gestural, postural and vocal cues may play an
important role in Western contexts, but one that is de-empha-
sized in developmental psychology as a reflection of North
American culture. However, the plurality of methodological
approaches suggested by cultural evolutionary theory means
there is another option besides searching for single (or a set
of) cues that always indicate joint attention, across sociocul-
tural contexts. Instead, researchers should use an array of
cues, designed for particular sociocultural contexts, to compare
the prevalence and behavioural form of joint attention across
human populations. Using identical methods based on cultu-
rally specific cues will produce only superficially comparable
data, and will produce a misleading picture of the ways in
