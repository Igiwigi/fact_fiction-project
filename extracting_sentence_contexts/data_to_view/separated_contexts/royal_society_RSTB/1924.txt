2. If sea-water of normal density is now used to replace concentrated sea-water
a rapid swelling results, followed by a bursting of the wall and extrusion of
contents. This sudden restoration of normal density seems to be far more
injurious to the plants than a slow concentration, and this may perhaps
account for the fact that Pelvetia refuses to grow in rock pools. We find
that the germlings grow for a long time in sea-water which is allowed to
partly evaporate, and if the diminution of density is brought about slowly,
the plants continue to grow. SuMMARY.
