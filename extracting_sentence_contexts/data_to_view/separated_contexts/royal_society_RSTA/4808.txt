region, where the TADF materials formed by relatively strong electron donor-electron acceptor
units are more difficult to work, owing to the large Stokes-shift induced by the excited state charge
transfer [21]. In fact, most TADF materials emit in the green region, and obtaining efficient TADF
in the blue region is a very difficult task, which has not been fully achieved so far [20]. Figure 5 shows the chemical structure of the four materials used in this work, together with
their state diagrams and singlet and triplet energies. Material (2), one of the blue emitters used in
this work, is a pure non-charge transfer material, where only the 3arx* and the !z7* transitions
are involved on the population of the S; excited state.
