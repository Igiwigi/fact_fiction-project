Comparison of Results.

The successful completion of the investigation of the potassium salt of this ferrous
iron group enables a full comparison to be made of the crystals of all the four salts
of this group, on exactly the same lines as the four salts of each of the three groups
(zinc, magnesium, and nickel) of double selenates already described have been
compared, The fact that crystals of potassium ferrous selenate only form at
temperatures very near to 0° C., and spontaneously decompose into an opaque
porcelain-like substance, in less than half a day in moderately cold weather and almost
immediately at the temperature of a warm day, together with the fact that the
crystals of caesium ferrous selenate are magnificently transparent and relatively
permanent, capable of preservation in closed vessels for years, afford striking proof
of the progression in stability with the rise of atomic weight and atomic number of
the alkali metal.

Halit.—The progression in habit which has been observed in the other groups
of both double selenates and double sulphates is very clearly exhibited by the
ferrous iron group of double selenates. An inspection of figs. 1 and 2 (potassium salt),
4 (rubidium salt), and 6 (cesium salt) will make clear the progressive diminution in the
