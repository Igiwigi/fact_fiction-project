Having thus examined the ordinary structure. of the Dictyorylon Oldhamium, we may
now turn to some special points connected with its growth. LI have already pointed
that whilst in some specimens the ligneous zone is thin, consisting of but a very limited
number of vessels, as in Plate XXIL. fig. 4 (which condition is still more obvious in the
case of the older woody layer, e, of Plate XXIIL. fig. 6), I have obtained from Mr. Nizup
one magnificent axis in which the woody cylinder and its contained medulla has been
at least eighteen inches in circumference. 'The thickness of the wall of this vasculay
