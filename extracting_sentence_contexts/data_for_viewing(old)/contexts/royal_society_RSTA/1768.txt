while the gain itself is not high for 1D simulations, there is good reason to expect closer agreement


between experiment and 1D simulations than is typical. It is therefore hoped that gains of similar
magnitude to those presented here could be achieved experimentally, which is not true of typical
high gain 1D simulations.

In addition, it is important to note that the use of 1D simulations means that high accuracy
with these results is not claimed. It is expected that behaviour in this regime would be close to 1D-
like, but more detailed simulations would be required to make exact claims about performance.
Instead, these results are intended as indicators of the level of performance that may be possible
in such a regime, to assess its viability. The potential of stable implosions in this regime, coupled
with the fact that these estimates of gain are indeed high enough to be of interest, suggests that
this regime does therefore warrant further investigation.

6. Outlook

The results demonstrated in this paper suggest some clear directions for future work. The

most obvious next step is to increase the dimensionality, performing 2D simulations to : =
investigate hydrodynamic instability growth and provide further confidence that performance : >
is approximately one-dimensional in this regime. Such simulations would also provide a more [3
accurate estimate of the performance that could be expected from such capsules (particularly :2
as the agreement observed with experiment in [6] was found using 2D simulations). An 8
investigation of this regime placing limits on the adiabat would also be an interesting extension if
