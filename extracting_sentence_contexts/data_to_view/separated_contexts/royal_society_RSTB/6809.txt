It is convenient to deal first with the use of centres of ossification as criteria in
determining the independence, or the dual or single nature, of a bone. This is because,
though widely held to be most unreliable by embryologists, it has constantly cropped
up in discussions of this particular problem and has reappeared even in the most
recent comments (Olson 1938). First, the fact that the palatine processes of some mammals ossify from separate
centres was the reason for regarding them as separate bones and the basis on which
they were homologized with the prevomers. But de Beer (1937) says:

The attempt might be made to define a bone according to embryological criteria as the
product of a single embryonic centre of ossification, but this leads into serious difficulties. In
the first place, many single bones may arise from more than one centre of ossification.

* de Beer (1937, p. 494) says: “It is to be concluded from this discussion, therefore, that while
morphological relations between different structures are remarkably constant, this constancy must not
be taken as implying a hard and fast rule.”


ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAMMALIAN PALATE 319

and

The parietal in Man must, therefore, be regarded as affording evidence of the sub-division
of an originally single bone, further examples of which are provided by the squamosal, tympanic,
malleus, stapes, and certain Wormian ossifications in Man, or the suborbital and opercular
ossicles in Lepidosteus.

and again

In other words, it is not possible to arrive at a satisfactory definition of what constitutes a bone along
embryological lines, in terms of separate centres of ossification. (Italics de Beer’s.)

It is clear therefore that there are no reliable grounds on which the independence
of the palatine processes in mammals can be asserted.
