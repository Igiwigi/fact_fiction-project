We found
that I, and Ig give high p-values, 0.31 and 0.32, respectively, thus confirming the non-significance
of the regression analysis and the independence of the values of I4 and Ig from the exemplar and
pair of concepts. On the contrary, the regression analysis of I4 and Ip (and I,4g,’p’) gives low
p-values (p < 0.05), hence one cannot exclude that these functions have a weak dependence on
the exemplar that is considered. However, the values of the coefficients of the linear regression
are so small that they can be neglected, thus confirming the fact that I4, Ig, I’, Ip and I4garp are
constant functions across exemplars and pairs of concepts. We also calculated the correlation matrix for the values of Ix, ly, X = A, A’, Y = B, B’ and Lapa’p’,
finding that Ix and Iy positively related to each other and with I4pa’p, X =A,A', Y = B, B’, while
I, has a weak negative relationship with [4 and Ig has a weak negative relationship with Igy, as
expected. The correlation matrix is reported in table 5.
