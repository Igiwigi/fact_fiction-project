In addition, peculiar evolutionary
patterns of mollusc miRNAs, like the presence of typical
vertebrate miRNA families in the gastropod Patella vulgata,
have been reported [25]. The incomplete and error-prone
annotations of many miRNAs present in miRBase have
stalled progress in comparative analyses, leading to severe
misinterpretations of putative loss patterns and to an undue
devaluation of miRNAs in phylogenetic studies [21,26]. New databases, covering underrepresented species and
implementing the miRNA annotation with up-to-date cri-
teria, were in fact necessary and have been established [27]. The example of a curated miRNA gene database is MirGen-
eDB, initially developed from miRBase to provide reliable
datasets of miRNAs and then substantially extended to
species not present in miRBase [28], such as the Pacific
oyster Crassostrea gigas, the brachiopod Lingula anatina and
another five non-mollusc species. It is this kind of database
that opens comparative miRNA analyses to non-model
organisms of interest.
