Is there any reason to think such a subdivision probable, and how ec
take place? To answer this question recourse must be had to comparison of
details of spore-production in the Bryophyta, and in the Vascular Cryptogams;
former are already provided by the researches of Lerraxrs, while I hope to add t
latter in subsequent pages. The full discussion of this subject must, therefore,
at the end of this memoir ; but in the meanwhile certain facts and conclusions f
study of the Bryophyta may be considered. It has been seen that sterile cells (el
in certain Liverworts appear to be massed together, and form solid tissues, as it
case of the columella ; it is, therefore, reasonable to expect that some similar pr
may occur again in such Liverworts, or other plants, as show sterile cells seaâ€™
through their sporogenous masses. Now the Anthocerotee have by various
been recognized as plants whose sporophyte approaches that of vascular pla
than that of other Bryophyta (Lerrers, loc. cit.; Heft 6, p. 60; Prant, loc. cit., E
p. 62).
