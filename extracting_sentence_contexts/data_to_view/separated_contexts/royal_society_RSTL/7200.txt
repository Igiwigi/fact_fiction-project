Further observations on this point as opportunities occur will be interesting. As before stated, I regard the first tooth of the molar series of the young Kangaroo
as one of the premolars of the permanent series, and not (like the tooth placed imme-
diately behind it in the first stage of dentition) as a molar of the deciduous or milk-
series. It is in fact the homologue of the penultimate premolar of Phalangista,
Perameles, Didelphys, &c. The cireumstance of its being shed at a comparatively early
period is in relation to the general conditions which, in this genus, cause the early loss
of all the teeth between the incisor and true molar series, including the canine, and even
the snccessional premolar. In Hypsiprymnus a $till more potent reason prevails for its
early removal, in the immense size of the successional premolar, which requires 80 much
more space than is occupied by its diminutive actual predecessor.
