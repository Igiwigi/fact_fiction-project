The giant forms are chiefly the result of
vegetative amplification : comparing the spore-producing parts of living homosporous
Pteridophytes with those of their fossil correlatives, the present types, with few
exceptions, hold their own in point of complexity, and do not show evidence of any
general reduction, These considerations seem to me to justify the position that,
unless good evidence of reduction be brought forward in any given case, the spore-
producing members of the homosporous Archegoniate: should be regarded as in the
up-grade of evolution. *

Notwithstanding the great difference in general form between the sporophytes of
the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta, the two offer certain lines of analogy which are
important in the study of the methods of advance of the sporophyte ; these will now

* The physiological problems relating to the heterosporous condition, and especially those in seed plants,
have purposely been left out of account, so as to avoid unnecessary complication ; facts relating to them
have been brought forward oceasionally in formal comparison only in this Memoir. THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 217
