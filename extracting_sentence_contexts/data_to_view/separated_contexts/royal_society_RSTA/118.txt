When the laser
kills all the xanthophores in a large area, cell death also occurs in the melanophores, indicating
that xanthophores located at a distance are necessary for the survival of melanophores [25]. Mathematically, the network of interactions shown in figure 2a has similar properties to that of
the original Turingâ€™s model, as it includes both activation loops working at short distances and
inhibition loops working at long distances [15]. In fact, a simple ABM created using this network
can form stripes from random patterns. [21-24]. A three-cell network model with iridophores is
shown in figure 2b. Xanthophore
