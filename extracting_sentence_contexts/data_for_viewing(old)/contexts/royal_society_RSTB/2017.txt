~ about its long axis. The undulating and progressive motions of the isolated rods
S were continuous, steady, and fairly rapid, but gradually, as the rod divided and formed
> a chain of two united rods, the activity became less marked and was largely confined
Eto the forward rod, which swam about dragging after it its almost quiescent com-
g panion. By the time three rods had formed, the progressive movements had become
& very slow, and when the chains of rods had increased to four, motility was in most
3 cases visible only as a slow waving from side to side on the part of the terminal rod
$ or an equally slow rotation of the chain on its long axis. Within an hour long
chains had formed and there was no further sign of motility. I was utterly at
A a loss to reconcile these observations with what I knew of the organism so far, and I
was driven to the conclusion that in preparing the cells I had used a contaminated
broth. Nevertheless one important fact militated against this theory. After the
cultures were made, examination showed that every drop contained from 20 to 100
or more spores; when examined the next morning very few spores were visible in
any of the drops, while every one showed an abundance of motile rods. The whole
experiment was at once repeated under as nearly as possible the same conditions,
but without success, because the spores sown in the evening had, by the following
morning, produced long chains. Subsequently I was enabled to substantiate my
previous observations. On December 26th a plate-culture on saccharose-gelatine,
