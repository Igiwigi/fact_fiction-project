decades; in fact, many had noted the inter-country transport of pollutants in Europe (e.g. [60]).
It was only following Oden’s analysis that international scientific and political attention was
drawn to the subject and monitoring and process studies demonstrated the scale and ecological
significance.

The initial reaction of the major polluting countries in Europe was mixed. All recognized the
need to quantify the scale of inter-country transport of the major pollutants, the underpinning
atmospheric chemistry and physics, and the effects on ecosystems. However, the legal
instruments needed to be developed, and the supporting monitoring and analysis tools were
still lacking. The industrial nations had designed tall stacks to disperse the pollutants without
considering possible effects outside their jurisdiction. The combination of the science and political
background is described in detail by Grennfelt et al. [57]. An earlier description of the political
background in the UK by Rose [65] provides further insights and is typical of the large number
