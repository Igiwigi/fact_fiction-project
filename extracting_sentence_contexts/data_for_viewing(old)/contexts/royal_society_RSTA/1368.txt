Theorem 5.5. Suppose that the inequalities (1.2) for the Frank constants hold. For each pair of constants
e*,* as in (5.2), there exist a minimizing pair (@,p) of the energy (5.7) in the admissible set (5.16).
Furthermore, p € Ca(o*, 1/2). The same conclusions hold for the analogous problem in A‘.


Proof. Let {px, 9} be a minimizing sequence in A, for the functional (5.11). By the coercivity of
the functional and the fact that A, is non-empty, together with the Poincaré inequality, it follows
that this sequence has bounded H! norm. So, it has a subsequence that converges weakly to
a limit (¢,p) ¢ H'(¢*, 5) x H1(Q) and, so, strongly in L?. Since Weap (5-11) is polyconvex, the
corresponding energy is weakly lower semicontinuous. Hence Ecap(, €) = infy,y)cA, Ecap(p, 9).
The absolute continuity of p() is an immediate consequence of the fact that peH ¢*,% Es
Reversing the change of variables (5.9) the result applies to the energy in the form (5.7). The
conclusions can be immediately applied to the problem in Af. Indeed, by the properties of the
minimizing sequences, formulated in vector form, for convenience, we have that V - nV: nf
and nj- V x nj > f- V x ni, asj > ov, hold. a

Let us now turn to the energy minimization problem under the constraints (2.3).

Corollary 5.6. Suppose that the assumptions of theorem (5.5) hold. Let (pj, Gj) € Ae) be a sequence
