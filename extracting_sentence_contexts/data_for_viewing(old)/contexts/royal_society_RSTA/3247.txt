this can result in an instability of the single-scale potential. This is the standard argument for the
occurrence of an instability also in the standard model.

Alternatively, we may not remain on the simple level of (2.3), but compute the full top-quark =
contribution to the effective potential to one-loop order. This is given by the fermion determinant, : 3

where @ denotes the space-time volume, and the subscript A should remind us of the fact that : a
a regularization at the cut-off scale is necessary. The determinant can be worked out exactly. [8
For instance, for simple momentum cut-off regularization, we get [14] 18

We observe a negative mass term ~¢7. This is expected and ultimately absorbed in the
renormalization of the mass-like parameter that fixes the Fermi scale as the vacuum expectation
value v of the potential. Most importantly, the complete remainder being the interaction part of
the potential is manifestly positive at any finite field amplitude.
