ยง2(D) When the gas is uniform, all the derivatives of T and of (1%, 1, w,) are zero,
and f must depend only on m, T, and (U,V, W). It has, in fact, been shown by

and R is the universal gas constant in the characteristic equation of a gas:

The Distribution Function for a Non-uniform Gas. ยง2(E) When the gas is slightly non-uniform, / will differ slightly from the value
given by (7), which we shall denote by /,: we may therefore write

(10) f(U, V, W) =f, (U, V, W) {1+ F(U, Vv, W)}
