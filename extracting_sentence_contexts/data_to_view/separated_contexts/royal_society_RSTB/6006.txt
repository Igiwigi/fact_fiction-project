These are the cartilages which Sontes called mesotic or
basiotic. They clothe the median faces of the cochlear portions of the auditory sac,
and are the first part of the auditory capsules to undergo chondrification. The fact
that they are independent of the parachordal is of theoretical importance, since it
further invalidates Gavupp’s theory (already contradicted for the mammal by
NoorpDENsBos (1905), DE Brrr (1929), and p—E Beer and Woopcer (1930)), that the
