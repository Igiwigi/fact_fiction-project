change of situation, which certainly indicates that they are not simply neryes of
motion, but are for an especial function. In the larva they are situated very close to
the anterior part of the ganglia, but-in the perfect insect they have moved forwards
very nearly half way between the ganglia. Now it is well known that during deve-
lopment there is a tendency in nerves to approach and unite with each other, the
lateral cords and ganglia are more closely approximated, and the ganglia in the ante-
rior part of the body approach and coalesce into one mass. But instead of all the
transyerse nerves uniting with the neryes from the ganglia, which, had they been
simple nerves of motion, we should expect they would have done, we find them in
the abdomen, carried forwards in the segments, and distributed separately to the
same muscles as those from the ganglia.

Another striking fact indicative of their separate function is their being distributed
largely, even in the larya, to the double rooted nerves for the future wings,.and but
Slightly, s0 far as can be discovered, to the primary organs of locomotion, the legs.
The nerves to the legs come directly from the gangliated cords, and communicate

both the motor and sensitive influence ; the legs themselves are but little concerned
in the function of respiration, and consequently are but tightly supplied with neryes
from the superadded series. But the nerves to the wings, being already formed of
two roots, could hardly require an additional one, were it not for some especial
purpose, and did not each root confer a distinct endowment.
