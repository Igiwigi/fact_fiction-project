Thus,
OM cutting of the crops interferes with the normal course of the vegetation, whilst the
Femoval of them from the land induces a gradual exhaustion. Further, the variations
of season from year to year will have their varied effect, accordingly as the condition
Bf the herbage is affected by such artificial treatment. It fact, it will be seen that
