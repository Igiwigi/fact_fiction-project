This, of course, gives considerable weight to his result. On
the other hand, in his method of supplying moisture it was not only the humidity that
altered, The air flow varied and with it probably the temperature gradient, so that the
influence of other conditions was not so completely eliminated as in the method of two
incubators here described. ‘There was also the fact that values of the humidity obtained
by the use of the diffusion hygrometer were the true mean values during the 24 hours. When these considerations are allowed for, the apparent advantage of the larger number
of eggs comes near to vanishing, if it does not actually reverse. Be this as it may, the writer ventures to think that the agreement found between the
results of experiments on such different lines is sufficiently close to put these results

beyond any reasonable doubt, and to settle the problem of moisture so far as the practical
incubation of hens’ eggs is concerned.
