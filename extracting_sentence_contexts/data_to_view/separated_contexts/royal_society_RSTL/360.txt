I drew on a $heet of paper several figures of two equal
circles cutting each other, placing the centres of the circles
in the first figure 7; of their radius from each other; in the
second figure 2; in the third A; and s0 on. The upper
crescent of these figures I painted blue, the lower crescent
red, and the part common to: both circles of a reddish yellow,
softening the colours into each other as they appeared in the
planet. For I considered that, in fact, it was not a single
image of Mars that was seen, but a number of differently
coloured images, lying in the same direction, though lifted
one above another, as represented in the annexed figures. D SO

Having prepared a number of these drawings, I repeatedly
compared them with the planet viewed: through the telescope
with different magnifying powers,‚Äù carefully noting which
figure he most resembled, and the time of observation. This being done, it was-easy'to calculate the exact altitude
from the time of observation, and to-make a very:near esti-
mate of the separation of the images from the figure referred
to, compared with the diameter of the planet found by-the
micrometer.
