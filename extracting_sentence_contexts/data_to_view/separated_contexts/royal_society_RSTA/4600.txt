In our previous communication we gave a series of values of the viscosity
coefficients of a sample of isopentane lent to us by the late Professor SCHORLEMMER. The quantity of liquid was very small, and the bviling-point varied by nearly 3° during
the distillation. For these reasons, and also from the fact that the sample was obtained
from petroleum, we thought it advisable to make additional observations on the
viscosity of this substance, and, if possible, on a product obtained from a different
source. We have been able to examine three different samples of isopentane made
respectively from English, Scotch, and Irish fusel oil by direction of the Photometric
