fectly straight. Large conspicuous red pigment-spots have appeared on the lower
edges of the second, third, fourth, and fifth abdominal somites.

As the series of drawings which I have given was made from swch a small number
of specimens, I am unable to contribute much information as to the changes of the
mouth parts, and must leave this, as well as the exact determination of the adult form
and systematic position of the species, to future research.

In his *© Facts for Darwin ' Fr. Mirter has figured a larva (fig. 33) which is
extremely like, if not identical with the one shown in fig. 90, and he regards it as the
young of a Prawn, closely related to Penaus. CLaus has suggested (* Crustacean-
System,” p. 35) that it is much more likely to prove to be a young Sergestid than a
Prawn, and the facts regarding its metamorphosis which T have given above, certainly
seem to point in the same direction, An earlier s8tage of development is given in
Fr. MiLLER's fig. 32, and a comparison with my fig. 84 will show that the same larva
at an earlier stage might, when erushed by a cover glass, present very much the same
appearance as this larva. If they are the same Fr. MirLeR is certainly mistaken in
his statement that fig. 33 follows directly after fig. 32, without the intervention of a
Schizopod stage, for the metamorphosis is really quite complicated, and a true Schizopod
stage exists, although it is of extremely ehort duration.
