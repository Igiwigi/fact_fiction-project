hydrogene.; or of carbonate of lime, if only that it was a com-
pound of lime, carbon or diamond, and oxygene. | In fact,
totally dissimilar substances may have-the/same ultimate ele-
ments, and even probably, in precisely-the/ same proportions :
nitrate of ammonia, and hydrate of ammonia, or crystals of
caustic volatile-alkali,* both ultimately consist of oxygene,
hydrogene, and azote. It is not probable that the present ore is a direct quadruple
combination of the three metals and sulphur, that these, in
their simple states, are its immediate component parts ; it is
much more credible that it is a combination of the three sul-
phurets of these metals. |

On this presumption I have made experiments to determine
the respective proportions of these sulphurets in it.
