proved that those experiments are not relevant against the conelusion in question, by
showing the difference between the free expanston of an elastic fluid, in which all the
power due to the expansion is expended in agitating the particles of the fluid, and is
reconverted into heat, and the expansion of the same fluid under « pressure equal to
its own elasticity, when the power developed is all communicated to external bodies,
such, for example, as the piston of an engine.

The free expansion of a vapour will be considered in the sequel.

(46.) Efficiency of a Vapour-Engine without heating by compression.

The numerical example of article (44.) sufficiently illustrates the fact, that the strict
fulfilment of the condition specified in article (43.), as necessary to the attainment
of the absolute maximum of efficiency of a vapour-engine, is impossible in practice.

Let us consider, in the first place, the effect of dispensing with the process DA,
during which the fluid is supposed to have its high temperature restored solely by
compression.

The effect of this modification is evidently, to add to the heat expended, that which
is necessary to elevate the temperature of the liquid from -, to r,, and to add to the
power developed an amount represented by the area ADE, fig. 22.

To express this symbolically, we have—
