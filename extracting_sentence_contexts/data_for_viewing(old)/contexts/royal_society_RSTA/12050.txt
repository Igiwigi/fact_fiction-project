without the use of cemented cover-glasses.

It is so easy to give a last glance at the images from the adjusted zone after
polishing that it should always be done, for one is then absolutely certain that the
desired surface has been obtained. It may be remarked that the use of a solvent for
the crystal as lubricating liquid is to be deprecated, as it destroys the faces of the
crystal, and so prevents the possibility of thus checking the adjustment.

2. As the second typical case, a monoclinic crystal may be considered, for which
determinations of extinction (for sodium light) in the symmetry plane, which i
considered to be developed as a prominent face, and an examination of the same plane
in convergent polarised light, have been carried out. These, it may be supposed,
reveal the fact that one of the median lines perpendicular to which we desire to grind —
a surface, is inclined at a certain angle smaller than 45° to the intersection (edge) of
the symmetry plane with either a prism, orthopinacoid, or dome face, or the basal
plane. Four operations are necessary in order to adjust such a crystal so that this
‘known direction of the median line shall be perpendicular to the grinding plane. The
crystal must first be cemented upon the holder in such a manner that the zone of
faces parallel to the edge just mentioned is approximately perpendicular to the
grinding plane; suppose, for instance, it is the prism zone of faces parallel to the
vertical axis, containing the symmetry plane (clinopinacoid), the orthopinacoid, and
several prismatic forms. The symmetry plane must, in the second place, be made
exactly parallel to the upper tangent screw of the adjusting apparatus. The whole
zone should, in the third place, be exactly adjusted perpendicular to the grinding
plane. It then only remains to carry out the fourth operation of rotating the tangent
