I ought, perhaps, to have previously observed, that these deposits could not have
been formed when the valley was filled with water to the level of the shelves, for the

detritus has the character of matter accumulated in shoal water, and the beds abut
abruptly against the bases of the mountains, instead of blending with the alluvium
on their surface, as would necessarily have happened had the whole been deposited
at the same time at the bottom of one basin. The conclusion, that these valleys have been occupied by a sheet of subsiding water,
follows more plainly from a somewhat different class of facts. I have before re-
marked, that where a streamlet crosses a shelf, especially if it be the lower one, an
obliquely truncated buttress, the form of which was represented by dotted lines in
the wood-cut No. 1, projects from the side of the hill. It is quite evident that these
were accumulated when the sbelf existed as a beach, and the streamlet at present
only acts in removing those portions with which it comes in contact.
