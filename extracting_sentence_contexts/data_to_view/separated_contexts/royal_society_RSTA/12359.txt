; | 4g met by the fact that the damping effect of even slight friction is increased consider-
ably by high velocities. Now a viscous liquid can move irrotationally, and if there
were no friction at the boundaries this is the class of motion it would take in cases
of flux past or through obstacles. But if the obstacle terminated in a sharp edge,
this would make the velocity there infinite, and the friction, however inconsiderable
| elsewhere, would here become of account.
