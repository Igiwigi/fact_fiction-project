a superficial area of 11 acres, and 70 to 80 feet deep in the centre, had been formed
by throwing across a valley a barrier 87 feet high, 16 feet wide at top, 480 feet at
bottom, and 340 feet long, constructed of clay with a facing of gravel and stone.* A
small breach was accidentally formed, and 80 rapidly increased, that the barrier
suddenly gave way, and a portion, 140 feet wide at top and 25 feet at bottom, was
carried away at one 8woop, and the reservoir drained in a very short space of time.
Similar rapid bursting of reservoirs, under like cireumstances, have occurred in the
neighbourhood of Sheffield, in works connected with the Crinan Canal, and elsewhere.
In eases of slight overflow of river banks like results have followed, and the inevitable
consequences of guch accidents are well known to all engineers.

Nor, although we might fairly predicate what would be the effect of the bursting of
an ice-barrier, are we entirely without evidence of the fact, In the first class of
glacier lakes before described, the water escapes, sometimes quickly, at other times
slowly, through fissures and crevasses in the glacier, which itself does nob materially
suffer, In the 8econd class of larger lakes, formed by a glacier barrier transverse to
the main valley, the barrier is carried away snddenly whenever the pressure becomes
too great or an overflow sets in, and the water is discharged with resistless rapidity.
One of the best-known cases of snch casualties is that recorded by CHARPENTIER,f in
which, in 1818, a glacier descending from a lateral ravine crossed the valley of Bagnes,
and dammed back the small stream of La Drance. This s0on formed a lake, which
grew to be about 2 miles long and more than 200 feet deep at its lower end. In the
summer the dam of ice gave way, and in twenty minutes the whole volume of water,
estimated at 600,000 cubic toises, was discharged. The ground covered by the lake
suffered little or no change, except near its outlet ; but the torrent spread destruction
