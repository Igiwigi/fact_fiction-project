integration of homeostatic sensory and motor (pre-autonomic)
activity in the middle insula (‘homeostatic sentience’; [10]).

Importantly, the interoceptive pathway terminates also in the
cingulate motor cortex [18,19]. Together, the insular and cingulate
cortices constitute the homeostatic sensorimotor cortex that sur-
mounts the ancient homeostatic hierarchy in the spinal cord,
brainstem and hypothalamus [3,7,10]. (We infer from evolution-
ary studies that they may have originated as a unified region in
the earliest mammals, but were split into ‘orbital’ sensory and
‘cingulate’ motor portions by the expansion of prefrontal cortex
[20,21].) The insular and cingulate cortices are conjointly activated
during all affective bodily feelings [10]. In fact, considerable evi-
dence supports the assertion that they are uniquely activated in
humans during all feelings and all emotions, and further, that
they function as a ‘core control network’ that coordinates, med-
iates and switches activity between networks across the entire
brain [10,22]. Indeed, clinical studies now suggest that the insular
and cingulate cortices bilaterally are crucial brain areas that are
abnormal in an array of mental disorders [23].

Thus, the bilateral insular and cingulate cortical areas
together serve as the homeostatic /emotional /limbic sensorimo-
tor neocortex and provide adaptive (homeostatic) control of both
the body and the brain. This sensorimotor architecture fits with
