H. G. CANNON ON THE FEEDING MECHANISM OF THE BRANCHIOPODA. 333

and that as a result of the metachronial rhythm of the limb movements “ there must
have been produced a series of regions of high pressure alternating with regions of low
pressure which passed continuously forwards in the mid-ventral space between the
limbs and this must have resulted in a transport of the particles towards the mouth.”
Now the Branchiopoda with the exception of the Notostraca possess degenerate maxille
and reduced maxillules (see Appendix). It is probable that the common ancestor of the
Branchiopoda and Malacostraca possessed a well-developed maxilla which functioned as a
feeding mechanism as in modern Malacostraca (CANNON, 1928, a, p. 820). The forward
stream of particles along the mid-ventral line to the mouth may have been an accidental
result of the primary respiratory stream. In fact, that particles were retained at all-in
the mid-ventral space resulted from the elaboration of the setal armature along the inner
edges of the limbs and this may have been primarily to get rid of those particles. The
self-cleaning system of sete on the endites may have been the method of keeping the
limbs clean so that the current of water over the gills was not impeded.

Thus in the original minute Branchiopod the anteriorly directed food stream was
a secondary result. Judging by modern Crustacean standards it could not have been
an efficient method of food collection, as only a fraction of the particles sucked in would
find their way into the mouth; nevertheless, it formed part of the total feeding
mechanism. Now increasing size resulted in an increased amount of suspended matter
and an increase in the individual size of particles sucked in, but at the same time, the
effect of the suctions passing forwards to the mouth diminished. Firstly, they would
