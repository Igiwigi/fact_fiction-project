exists as represented by |Yy(to, 0, A))t, contemplative human observers could perceive the present a
moment and recall the past. As the conditional state |Y\(to,0,))t represents the galaxy existing : S
only for a small duration around f;, the subjective perception of the present moment and recalling D8
the past is likewise confined to the same region of time. However, as all elements of Yj,,¢,,, have : S
equal physical status, if one element has this representation, then they all do equally! The only aos

option, then, is for the set Vj.,5,, to be an objective basis for humans to perceive the present
moment and recall the past at all associated times t..°

There is a further implication for us in the distribution of the conditional states |Y\(to,o,))t
over time. The increase in t, for successive values of N is given by st§¥°* ~ /(a4VN) which is
less than 35tmin [10], where d5tmin is the temporal resolution limit, and hence the set of values
of the clock time f, are physically indistinguishable from a continuous range. The fact that the
spread in time Af, given by equation (5.1) is independent of N, whereas 5f$"°° + 2/(aA/N)
decreases as N increases implies that the conditional states |Yy(fo,o,A))t for sufficiently large,
successive values of N will overlap in time. A given clock time ft, will, therefore, be associated
with the ordered collection of conditional states such as {|Ynr(to,o,A))t: fe — t| < Atc} where
t= (20 /o)/N’. In other words, any particular clock time value f, is associated with an ordered
collection of conditional states. To make a comparison with human experience, note that the
timescale associated with conscious awareness is of the order of a second [27], which is many
orders of magnitude greater than the intervals such as Aft, considered here. The subjective
awareness of time is associated, therefore, with a set of many conditional states |Yy(to,,4))t that
overlap in time and are ordered in terms of increasing clock time. These time-ordered conditional
states of the galaxy carry a description of time-ordered neurological effects in the humans within
it, and this provides an objective basis for the subjective perception of a ‘flow’ or ‘passage’
