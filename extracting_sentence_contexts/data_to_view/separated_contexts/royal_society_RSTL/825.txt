The history of Commodore BiLLIiNGs's expedition may be
told in few words. He sailed with two light vessels out of
the Kolyma, on the 24th of June, 1787. He met with much
ice, and on the 2oth of July, without having reached so far
eastward as the isJand Sabedei, he relinquished the farther
prosecution of the attempt by sea; at the very season, in fact,
which was the most proper that could have been chosen for
his outset from the Kolyma.* In this short attempt, Com-
modore BiLLiNGs did not even get sight of the north land ;
but an approach to it was to be-inferred from the soundings. The snow and ice were at this time rapidly dissolving, $0 as
to cause currents to set for several days continuance in one
direction ; and during that time, the water on the surface of
the sea was 80 fresh as to be used for cooking, and some-
times for drinking. Afterwards, Commodore B1LLiNGs, with the consent of the
Tschuktzki people, made a progress by land along a part of
the Tschuktzki coast.
