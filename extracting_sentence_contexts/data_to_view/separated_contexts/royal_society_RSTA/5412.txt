For example, it is estimated that the 2003 heat wave in
Europe killed as many as 35 000 people. With modern urban lifestyles cities are
consuming ever more power, which is still largely generated by fossil fue
combustion; the main uses are heating or air conditioning homes and buildings
and powering vehicles, with industry in cities now taking a relatively smal
oroportion. In fact cities discharge an amount of heat comparable to tha
received from solar radiation. Inevitably they contribute to greenhouse gas
emissions from fossil fuel combustion and also from waste disposal managemen
oractices. As rapidly growing cities are clearing forests and vegetated areas, they
are reducing the surface absorption of greenhouse gases and thereby further
increasing their concentration in the atmosphere.
