If these be mules, as I do not entertain any doubt that
they are, the spawn of fishes must be without sex when it is deposited by the
female; and LI am much disposed to- entertain the. same opinion respecting
the spawn (for it is more properly spawn than' eggs) of bees. I have frequently witnessed some somewhat analogous circumstances in the
vegetable world, respecting the sexes of the blossoms of plants ; and I can at
any time succeed in causing several kinds of monoecious plants to produce
solely male or solely female blossoms. - If: heat be, comparatively with the
quantity of light which the plant receives, excessive, male flowers only appear ;
but if light be in excess, female flowers alone will be produced :—the experi-
ments necessary must of course be-made with skill and accuracy. In a former communication to the Royal Society © Upon the comparative
influence of the male and female parent upon the character of the offspring,”


RELATING TO THE ECONOMY OF BEES. 323

I have inferred, from facts there stated, that the sex of the offspring of some
species of animals is given by the female parent. Subsequent experience and
observation have strengthened my þelief in the truth of this inference : but I
believe the power of the female parent to be rather strongly influential than
positive, and that external causes operate, which (I have some reason to sus-
pect) are not in all cases wholly beyond the reach of human controul. Tromas Anprew KNIGHT.
