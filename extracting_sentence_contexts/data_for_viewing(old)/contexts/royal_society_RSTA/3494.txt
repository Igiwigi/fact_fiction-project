phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 [6]) reveals a rather different picture
(figure 1). Most of the models that included oxygen in the archived output [7-14] (table 1)
show increasing linear oxygen trends for the period 1960-2010 over large areas of the tropical
thermocline. Trends become more negative in the subtropics, reaching largest oxygen declines
at mid-to-high latitudes. In fact the pattern correlation between simulated oxygen trends and
the observational trend estimate is very weak for all models, and even slightly negative for
6 out of 10 models (computed over the latitude range 50°S-50°N, table 2). The weak pattern
correlations of any model with the observational estimate, as well as among the different models
themselves, is per se not unexpected: All CMIP5 model runs used here are forced by historical
CO) emissions (and those of other greenhouse gases and land-use change), but have their own
internal ocean-atmosphere dynamics and thus cannot be expected to simulate patterns associated
with internal climate variability in phase with the observations. The UVic model of intermediate
complexity [15], on the other hand, is driven by prescribed monthly varying climatological winds
and thus cannot display realistic levels of internal climate variability. The common forcing of all
models is greenhouse-driven global warming. The absence of statistically significant correlations
between observed and simulated patterns of multi-decadal oxygen change suggests that this
