the harder metals; for the oscillations damped down so quickly that only a
comparatively small number took place. The difficulties of observation were also
increased by the fact that, although a light aluminium vibrator was used with the
wire, it underwent a considerable elongation, especially at the higher temperatures. At the second heating to 100° ©. this elongation was so great that the vibrator
moved about in jerks as the wire gave way, and rendered timing impossible.
