Zof the commonly known hydrogen atom, or one-fourth, as assxumed by Dumas, the
Zquestion admits of practical examination.
ZZ Well dexerved attention has for xome years past been given to the labours of STAs
Sim this direction, and his main result is no doubt properly accepted, if stated thus,
that the differences between the individual determinations of each of snndry atomic
& weights which have been most carefully examined are distinctly less than their differ-
Z ence, or the difference of their mean, from the integer (or one-half or one-fourth unit
E which ProvT's law would require.

But the inference which STas himself seems disposed to draw, and which is very
S commonly taken as the proper conclusion from his results, namely, that ProuT's law is

disproved, or is not supported by the facts, appears much more open to dispute.

It must be remembered that the most careful work which has been done by STAs
and others only proves by the close agreement of the results that fortuitous errors
have been reduced within narrow limits. It does not prove that all sources of constont
error have been avoided, and indeed this never can be a√æbsolutely proved, as we never
can be sure that our knowledge of the snbstances we are dealing with is complete.
Duwas' late observations on the occlusion of oxygen by metallic silver constitute an
illustration of this, s0me of the best of STas' results being thereby undeniably
vitiated, though probably to but a minute extent.
