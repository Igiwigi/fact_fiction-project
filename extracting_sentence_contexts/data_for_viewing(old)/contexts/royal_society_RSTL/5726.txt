A=B, B=C, C=A;
in this case a pair of factors of the quartic are harmonics with respect to the other pair
of factors. If we have simultaneously I=0, J=0, then

A=B=C=0;
l and in this case three of the factors of the quartic are equal.
A 144. If any two of the linear factors of the quartic are considered as forming, with
EE: the other two linear factors, an inyolution, the sibiconjugates of the involution make up
'5 a quadratic factor of the cubicoyariant; and considering the three pairs of sibiconju-
= gates, or what is the same thing, the six linear factors of the cubicovariant, the factors
5 of a pair are the sibiconjugates of the involution formed by the other two pairs of
Sd factors.
S In fact, the sibiconjugates of the involution formed by the equations
= | (z—ay)(a—ty)=0, (x—y)(a—19)=0
= are found by means of the Jacobian of these two functions, viz. of the quadrics

A viz. a quadratic factor of the cubicovariant ; and forming the other two factors, there is
5 no difficulty in seeing that any one of these is the Jacobian of the other two.
