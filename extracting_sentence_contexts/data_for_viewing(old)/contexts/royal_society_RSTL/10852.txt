Z of experiments desecribed in $$ 87-88, and represented in figs. 41 and 42, another series
A of observations was conducted on the same wires and with these in the same states as
in the foregoing tests, by a wholly different method. Each wire, after being demag-
netised by reversals, had a definite load applied to it. Then magnetising force was
gradually applied, and the relation of J to H was observed. This gave a curve of
magnetisation under that particular load. Then, after demagnetisation, a different
load was put on, another curve of magnetisation taken by again applying magnetising
force, and s0 on. The magnetising force was applied gradually and continuously by
' means of the slide described in $ 18, and the magnetisation was observed by the
| direct magnetometric method. Tn fact, as regards measurement of magnetism and
field, the conditions of each experiment .were identical with those under which the
changes of magnetisgm were caused by changing loads in a constant field, and the
