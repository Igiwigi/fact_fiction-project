Continuity at a plastic-elastic interface

12. At this point it is necessary to consider whether any component displacement, strain
or stress can be discontinuous at an interface; for the argument used in the theory of elasticity,
that discontinuous displacement would entail an infinite strain and therefore stress, plainly

is no longer applicable when (§2) an infinite strain can consist with finite stress.

S Continuity of displacement is an assumption, necessary to the progress of this investigation,
‘Which almost certainly is valid in respect of its examples. (We cannot exclude the physical
“Epossibility of finite ‘slip’ at a plastic-elastic interface, but it would seem to be a reasonable
Beonjecture—frequently made in work in soil mechanics—that when such slip occurs the
Zinterface is either straight or circular, and neither is the fact in our solutions.) On that
‘gassumption e,, must be continuous, also the stretch in the direction of the interface.

13. Continuity of stress can be postulated if (on the ground that an interface consists
yf points at which the conditions of plastic straining are just attained) the quantity on the
= left of the Mises-Hencky criterion (17) or (20) is assumed to have the same value on both
sides of it. For if Ox has the local direction of the interface, it may be postulated that both X,
and Y, are continuous, since otherwise the conditions of equilibrium would require 0X,/dx
‘Zand 0X,/dx to take infinite values. Then, according to (17),

EB X3—XY,+4Y} = (%-W,)?

} is continuous, therefore (X,—4Y,) and hence X,; and a like conclusion may be drawn from
