Still it is scarcely doubted that in this respect the system of end-
Smeaures has an advantage. On the other hand, there is no doubt that, by repeating
Ethe measures, and by varying the observers, the errors in line-measures arising from
Erccognized causes will be eliminated, and unexceptionable accuracy will be given to the
Erexults.
& *9. After consideration of all these points, as far as they were known at the time ;
Zremarking, in particular, the freedom of a line-standard from any tendency to constant
Swear, the applicability of a line-standard to our geodetic measures, the facility of com-
Eparing all other measures of a similar construction with a scale carefully subdivided, the
Acireumstance that there exist no means of reproducing the old standard length but by
reference to existing line-measures, and the historical fact that the British standard for
many years past has been a line-standard ; we decided on adopting a line-standard, or
measure @& traits, for the Parliamentary Standard of Length. *10. The point which next engaged our attention was the material of which the new
Standard of Length should be formed.
