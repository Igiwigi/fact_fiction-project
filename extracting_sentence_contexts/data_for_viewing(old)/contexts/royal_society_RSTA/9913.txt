that which agrees most closely with that calculated from the formula, and I have
treated Rrrz in the same way, calculating his § (2.6.7.8). The observations for
$(2) are by B. They are in no way comparable with the corresponding values by P.
in the case of Na and K. In fact, B.’s readings give v = 245°07, or an error of about
16 A.U. in the wave-length differences of §, (2) and $,(2). Probably Rrvz is closer to
§ (2) than the formula in «/m; on the other hand, he has errors from nine to ten
times the allowable in two cases.

RbD. In the D series it has been thought that Rb has a satellite to 7753 (L.),
viz., 7759 (S.). If we take » = f and use K.R.’s values for D (4.5.6), it can be shown
that it is impossible to get within wide limits of either 8. or L.’s D (8), or of
Brremann’s D (2); but it is possible to satisfy conditions for D (3) if what has been
supposed to be the satellite is actually the line D, (3), ae, 7759°5 8. instead of
7753'58 L., but still D, (2) comes far wide of B.’s value on the side of longer W.L.
With » = 1 + f the calculated place of D,, (3) is close to the supposed satellite, and it
can only be modified to bring it to the supposed Dy, @e., 7758, by giving large
