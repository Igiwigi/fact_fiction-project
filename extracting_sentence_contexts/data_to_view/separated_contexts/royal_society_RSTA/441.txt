However, nothing prevents the use of a more complicated model valid for thick plates
(e.g. Mindlin-Reissner plate theory). In fact, the DD strategy is independent of the chosen plate


theory. Hence, the mentioned strategy can be applied also in combination with higher order
plate theories, as long as the plate model gives both the displacement and the displacement
velocity back to the fluid solver and receives as input from it the fluid pressure on the plate. When the DD strategy is used, and the three-dimensional solver is used in the fluid region
containing the structure, p is obtained by solving the fluid-structure coupled problem, i.e. it is
affected by the plate elastic behaviour.
