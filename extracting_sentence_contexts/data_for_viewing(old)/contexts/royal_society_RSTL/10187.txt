being carried on by the ordinary cilia of the stomodzum,

In the genus Czlogorgia we have an example of an Aleyonarian which resembles the
Gorgonidz in many respects, but differs from them in the important fact that a single
large canal occupies the position of the solid axis of the other forms, We must
guppose that there is a constant circulation going on in this axial canal as well as in
the ordinary canals of the colony, and corresponding with this we find a well-marked
giphonoglyphe in the polyps for carrying on this more extensive circulation.

In the genus Solenogorgia described by GeNTH (1) there is a somewhat similar
condition, large canals being present in the axis of the colony and again in Solenocaulon
described by GRAY (4). A re-examination of these genera would probably reveal the
fact that their polyps possess a well-marked siphonoglyphe such as we find in the genus
Calogorgia.

The genus Zeliopora presents us with a condition which is not 80 easy to
understand. The sarcosoma of the other forms of Alcyonaria is here represented
only by a delicate layer of tissue covering the skeleton, but at the same time, owing
to the large amount of space occupied by the ccenenchymal tubes, there must be a con-
8iderable amount of fluid constantly circulating throughout the colony. Tt is, therefore,
somewhat surprising to find but a feebly-developed siphonoglyphe in the stomodzwum
of the polyps. It may be, however, as Professor MosgLey has s8uggested to me, that a
rapid circulation would be of no particular advantage to a colony which possesses bub
a small amount of living sarcosoma, or indeed by hurrying away the food partieles, ib
might be positively disadvantageous to it. This may possibly account for the feeble
