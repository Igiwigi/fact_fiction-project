This sac opens by a ronnded aperture in its upper part upon the right side of the
animal, and is of course continually filled by the surrounding water. As the ac is
incessantly contracting, however, this water must be continually renewed, and hence ,
the organ, simple as its structure appears and small as its size may be, is probably
a very efficient depurating agent®. Considerations to be stated hereafter, lead me to the belief that it is in fact the
nrinary organ, at once kidney and urinary bladder. Reproductive System.—Firoloides is dicxcious. The male may be distinguished at
once from the female, by the peculiar penis (p) attached to the right posterior
inferior angle of the body (fig. 4).
