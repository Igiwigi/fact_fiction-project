The sulfate of potass decomposes
5 the phosphate of barita, because the difterence of the attrac-
= tions of barita for the sulfuric and phosphoric acids is greater
2 than the difference of the similar attractions of potass ; and in
5 the same manner the difference of the attractions of potass is
E greater than that of the attractions of soda ; consequently the
S difference of the attractions of barita must be much greater
E than that of the attractions of soda, and the sulfate of soda
= must decompose the phosphate of barita: and in the same

manner it may be shown, that each base must preserve its
relations of priority or posteriority to every other in the series. It is also obvious that, for similar reasons, the acids may be
arranged in a continued sequence between the different bases;
and when all the decompositions of a certain number of salts

have been investigated, we may form two corresponding
tables, one of the sequences of the bases with the acids, and
another of those of the acids with the different bases ; and if
either or both of the tables are imperfect, their deficiencies
may often be supplied, and their errors corrected, by a re- '
peated comparison with each other. In forming tables of this kind from the cases collected by
Fourcoy, I have been obliged to reject some facts, which
were evidently contradictory to others, and these I have not
thought it necessary to mention ; a few, which are positively
related, and which are only inconsistent with the principle of
numerical representation, I have mentioned in notes; but many
others, which have been stated as merely prohable, I have
omitted without any notice. In the table of simple elective at-
tractions, I have retained the usual order of the different sub-
stances:; inserting again in parentheses such of them as require
to be transposed, in order to avoid inconsequences in the simple
-attractions: I have attached to each combination marked with
an asterise the number deduced from the double decomposi-
tions, as expressive of its attractive force ; and where the
number is inconsistent with the corrected order of the simple
elective attractions, I have also inclosed it in a parenthesis. Such an apparent inconsistency may perhaps in some cases be
unavoidable, as it is possible that the different proportions of
the masses concerned, in the operations of simple and com-
pound decomposition, may sometimes cause a real difference
in the comparative magnitude of the attractive forces.
