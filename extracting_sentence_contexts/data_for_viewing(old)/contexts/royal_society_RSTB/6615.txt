The outer surface of the first branchial arch contains, towards its upper end but
not in contact with the margin of the gill chamber, a single isodiametric bone below
which lie three narrow splints each overlapping the one below and in front of it. In
the actual specimen this arch lies very near the second branchial, and its operculum is
in consequence not very clearly shown.

The second and third arches have only a single long splint, and each supports a
short deep operculum containing horizontal rays which seem to be continuous
throughout their length.

The whole structure of the branchial region in Brachyacanthus thus agrees with that
in Climatius, differing only in the general proportions and especially in the fact that all
the “bones” in the various opercular folds are very much bigger and more massive.
It is of importance because it gives independent and very satisfactory evidence that the
first and largest operculum is actually a structure arising from the mandibular arch
and is quite independent of the hyoid.

Median Fins—The first dorsal fin spine arises from the most dorsal part of the body. It
has a very widely expanded base whose border meets the last of the median scutes in
front, and for the rest of its extent is directly in contact with the ordinary squamation.
