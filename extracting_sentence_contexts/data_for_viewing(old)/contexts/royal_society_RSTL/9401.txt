sought to discover the rates of changes. But when we come to integrate and find the
total changes in a given time, regard will have to be paid to the fact that both 7 and
7 are variables. ; 6

For the immediate purpose of this section the numerical values of 1, uf, uu, given
in (39), will be used.

I will now apply the foregoing results to the particular cage where the earth is a
viscous gpheroid.

Let p=, where v is the coefficient of viseosity.
