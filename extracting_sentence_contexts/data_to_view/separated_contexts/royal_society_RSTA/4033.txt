A particle
directly on this contour would migrate along it toward the micropost corner, unless that location
is already occupied by a particle. In that case, particles accumulate along the ridge. Particle paths,
in fact, are more complex, modulated by particle-particle and particleâ€”wall interactions owing
to capillarity and hydrodynamics. However, the structure built up by the particles is strongly
correlated with this underlying curvature gradient map. As each particles is trapped along its
first site of encounter with either the micropost or a neighbouring particle, these curvature
driven flux assembly limited structures (akin to diffusion limited structures and other flux-limited
structures).
