extent, the lateral surfaces of the nervous tissue of the ganglion, are most interesting.
These cells are of the unipolar, pear-shaped type, and are quite removed from the
dense nerve substance of the ganglion. Each is covered by a delicate cellular sheath,
and this alone separates the cell substance from the blood ; for they may be said to
hang in bundles suspended by their processes, and steadied by the reticulum of the
inner sheath, in blood spaces of that tissue. Between them, in the mid-ventral line,
and below them, in the posterior region of the ganglion, are the venous sinuses men-
tioned above.

The mass of the ganglion is composed of a fibrous reticulum, coarse in some places,
fine in others, and the fibres in the finer reticulum appear to touch one another, so
that blood spaces are conspicuous by their absence. In the case of nerves and
of commissures the same fact strikes one, whether they are viewed in the fresh
condition, or examined by means of sections—the sheathings of the nerve fibres are
contiguous with one another, and, at first sight, no provision appears to have been
made for their nutrition. This may, I think, explain the prevalence of “ tubular
fibres” in the central nervous system and peripheral nerves of Astacus. Each of these
fibres in section appears as a tubular nucleated sheath, and little more. The contents
