plot 3, the examination of, and the determinations of nitrogen in, the 8ubsoil of plot 12
showed it to be mnch more mouldy and much richer than that of plot 3, and it was
concluded that the plot consisted, in great part at any rate, of made or moyed ground,
the site possibly of a filled-up hollow, or of a removed and levelled plantation or hedge
green. Neither the sections nor the analyses of the 8nbsoil of plot 13 showed any
swch characters, however, s0 that, independently of manure, the only known difference
between it and plot 9 was in its earlier afternoon shade.

The herbage of plot 13 has become even more prominently gramineons than that of
plot 9. Leguminose have almost equally disappeared on both ; and the Miscellanees
have also greatly reduced on both, Rumex acetosÂ« being the only very prominent weed
on either, Conopodium denudatum coming next. The increase of produce on plot 13
was, in fact, almost exclusively due to an increase in gramineous herbage, and this,
compared with that of plot 9, contained very much more Dactylis g., which here
becomes the most prominent species ; about the s8ame proportion of Agrostis v., con-
siderably less Holcus T., very much less of Festuca o., and especially of Poa prat. ; but,
on the other hand, a fair proportion of Alopecurus p., which is scarcely represented on
plot 9; whilst, Avena pub. and flav., and Poa triv. have gone down very much on both
plots. Thus, compared with that of plot 9, the produce of plot 13 (with the straw)
was somewhat differently made up, but it comprised a considerable proportion of
everal of the freer-growing grasses. These, too, manifested considerable tendency to
form strong seed-stems.

These characters indicate liberal nitrogenons and mineral supply within the 8oil, and
as they predominated more on plot 13 than on plot 9, it would be supposed that these
