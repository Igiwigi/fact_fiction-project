116 DR. D. H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

distinctly that one might be inclined to doubt, with M. Zerter, whether these
plants were after all anything more than peculiar and highly modified Ferns. *
Yet even in this species clear indications of Cycadean affinities are present. The
whole structure of the petiole and leaf generally is strikingly like that of the Cycads ;
just as much so, in fact, as in any other “ Myelorylon.” + The occasional formation of
accessory bundles in the cortex of the stem is suggestive of Cycadean anomalies,
comparable with those observed by WEBER and StERzEL in other species of Medullosa.
