We review recent empirical evidence that
these disturbances can drive phenotypic trait changes in
urban organisms. In our review of empirical evidence, we are
broadly inclusive of evidence of phenotypic changes linked to
urban anthropogenic disturbances. Such changes create the
potential for eco-evolutionary feedback, if the observed changes
are in fact genetic. However, we caution that phenotypic change
is not synonymous with evolutionary change; urban-driven
changes in the attributes of populations, communities and
ecosystems influence phenotypes via selection and plasticity

[9]. Furthermore, some phenotypic changes are adaptive, and
some are maladaptive responses to environmental disturbances.
