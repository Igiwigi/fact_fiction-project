Boonsrra (1934) figures the transpalatine as
forming the back of the process in Notosollasia, Theriognathus, and Whaitsia. In the
figures I gave of the palates of Wotosollasia and Whaitsia in 1932, I indicated the ptery-
goids as forming the back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly
forms the back of the process in Hyenosaurus seems to render it probable that my inter-
pretation of the condition in Whaitsia and Notosollasia is correct. There is no sub-
orbital vacuity. Posteriorly, the pterygoid has a long outer process which extends to
very near the quadrateâ€”possibly articulating with it.
