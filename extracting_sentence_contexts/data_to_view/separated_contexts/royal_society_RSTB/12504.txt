culture analogy or not. One researcher starts from the theory, and people at least think they understand it (though
genes—culture analogy and progressively builds the differences in fact they often do not [47,48]). Critiques of its application
between genes and culture into her models. Another starts to culture can seem tantamount to saying ‘it’s all very complex
from cognitive science with no Darwinian assumptions, and and what happens depends on the details’.
