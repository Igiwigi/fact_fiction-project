without reason that it has been regarded as analogous to the 8emen,—as a 8ort of
female semen+.” , The same author on another occasion remarks, © That in the ger-
minal spot alone lies the sole foundation of the future germinal membrane, is scarcely
probable. It is rather probable that in the transition, the collective contents of the
gerininal membrane undergo an inward metamorphosis, comprehending, and in the
same manner changing both parts [germinal yesicle and spot]. This indeed is
shown by the fact, observed by Professor WacxeR himself, that at the period of ma-
turity [of the oyum] the granules [of the spot] become separate from one another,
and new granulations arise between them. Besides, the granules of the germinal
membrane are very different from the granulated substance of the delicate germinal
spot, in which all isolated corpuscles certainly for the most part fail. If the very fine
and delicate peculiar granular layer on the inner surface of the vitelline membrane,
pass into the future germinal membrane (which however is much to be doubted, and
has more against than for it), the contents of the germinal vesicle after the act of
conception, could only give the substance for the central portion of the germinal
membrane, out, of which indeed the new individual forms, and which therefore has
the greatest dignity #.”
