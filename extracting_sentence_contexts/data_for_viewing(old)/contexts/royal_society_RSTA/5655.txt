mixing by the same authors in [20], using some deep dynamical systems tools.

If one assumes that the energy spectrum or the LP spectrum decay like k~!, then one can
conclude that 6“ belongs to the Besov space BY oo" For s€R, 1<p,q <0e, the inhomogeneous
Besov space B, , is defined as follows:

By g(R?) = ff € SR?) | |Ifllas,, = NZI llL@eyller < oo}, (3.4)

with a similar definition on the torus T* [42]. These are Banach spaces and the dual (Big) = Boy
for 1 < p,q <0, where p’, q’ are the conjugate exponents to p, q. Above, S’(R?) denotes the space
of tempered distributions, the dual to the space S(R7) of smooth, rapidly decreasing functions.
The significance of the space BS oo in turbulence was already noted by Eyink [50] in the context
of the Kraichnan-Batchelor theory of two-dimensional turbulence. In fact, if u solves the two-
dimensional Navier-Stokes (respectively, Euler) equations, then its (scalar) vorticity # =curl u
satisfies (2.1) (respectively, (2.3)). The Navier-Stokes and Euler equations in vorticity-velocity
formulation have active transport, since u depends on w via the Biot-Savart law (for recent results
on renormalizing certain active transport equations we refer to [51]). We recall that the enstrophy
is defined as the L?-norm squared of vorticity, so formally the problem of anomalous enstrophy
dissipation is equivalent to the problem of anomalous scalar dissipation. Assuming the Kraichnan


scaling O(k~>) for the energy spectrum of u, associated with the forward enstrophy cascade,
implies that w € BS oo

We next address the well-posedness of (2.1)-(2.3) in the space BY oot We discuss only the case
