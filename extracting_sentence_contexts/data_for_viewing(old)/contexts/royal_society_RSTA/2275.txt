measured along with C using the (necessarily different) AC apparatus, would the A pointer have

ended up once again indicating A = a1? : =

Note that this is not at all the same question as asking whether the probability distribution for : =
A outcomes during a set of repeated AB measurements, all starting with the same initial state for 1B
the particle, would be the same as that of the A outcomes during a similar set of AC measurements. :2
Standard textbook quantum mechanics tells us that if we start with a particular initial state the 8
marginal distribution of A outcomes computed from the joint distribution of two commuting : o
observables A and B will be the same as that computed from the joint distribution of A and C. The in
question raised by Bell was not the identity of distributions, but the identity of outcomes in the : ยง
same run. Since A, B and C cannot be measured simultaneously, this is a counterfactual question: A : S
was measured with B; what would have been the A outcome had it (contrary to fact) been measured iad

along with C?

Thus the question of whether quantum mechanics is or is not Bell contextual has embedded
in it some issues in quantum foundations concerning which it is safe to say there is no general
agreement. My position regarding them will emerge in the next section; all I can ask of the
sceptical reader is to pay attention to the arguments and try and assess their validity with an
open mind.

Consider a projective measurement on a system, hereafter thought of as a particle, of an observable
