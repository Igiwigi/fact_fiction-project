ments or nearly complete sequences of related rhadinoviruses
have been documented in most Old World primate species,
including the great apes gorilla and chimpanzee; these viruses
appear to fall into two lineages, provisionally termed RV1 and
RV2 [52-58]. These observations suggest that KSHV, like all
other herpesviruses, has co-evolved with its host species over
a very long time span. This notion is further supported by the
fact that minor sequence variation (less than 3%) throughout
most, and more extensive sequence variation in the two genes
at either end, of the of the KSHV genome seem to have evolved
in different geographical regions, suggesting coevolution with
