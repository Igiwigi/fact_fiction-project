+ A very remarkable confirmation of the theory that these molecular streams are identical in their
nature with the phenomena above described is obtained from the fact that, as PLicxer has 8hown, the
metallic deposit in the neighbourhood of the negative terminal will follow the magnetic curves if the
deposit be allowed to take place in a magnetic field, thus showing that the particles of platinum Â«Y :
affected by a magnet in precisely the same way as the particles in these molecular streams. Other experity b
mental facts which in the opinion of the anthors of this paper conclusively demonstrate the substantial
identity of the two phenomena will be given in a subsequent portion of this paper (se page 648), but -
is not convenient to insert them here as it would require us to anticipate in s0me measure the results
