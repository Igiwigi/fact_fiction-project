In order to calculate the magnitude
of the greatest strain which these pieces could support, it will
be safest to proceed on the supposition, that each square inch
of the section of good oak timber is capable of resisting the
pressure of four tons on an average: it will then appear that
a single series of such braces, as Mr. SeypINGs employs, ex-
tending throughout the length of each side of the ship, would
support a weight of 14g tons, in whatever way the force
counteracting it might be applied ; and estimating the effect of
all the braces and riders as equivalent to about four such series,
the whole would resist a force of 570 tons; while the greatest
force derived from the distribution of the weight, together with
the action of such waves as we have considered, amounts to
about 450 tons: 80 that the strength of these braces can
scarcely be insufficient to support the pressure, unless the ship
Should be left dry, resting on the middle of her keel, and the
braces should be abandoned by all the other parts, which
usually cooperate with them.* The fastenings must indeed

be considerably weaker than this, and the other parts of the
ship considerably stronger ; but since the fastenings appear to
possess sufficient strength to resist any strain which is actually
likely to affect them, there seems to be no inconvenience in
their inferiority to the other parts. In fact, the Tremendous
actually supported, for three days, without any perceptible
change of form, a strain fully equal to that which is here cal-
culated, having been purposely left on shores, which extended
through z2 feet only of her length. But it must be re-
membered, that such a force, from its very gradual application,
must be much less trying to the ship's strength, than the more
abrupt changes which occur at sea, and it must on the whole
be inferred, that it would be unsafe to trust to the braces alone,
unsupported by the cooperation of the neighbouring parts. It would probably be easy to add some further strength to
these braces near the ends of the ship, where the strain on
them is the greatest, especially about go feet from the head,
if it were found that they gave way before the rest of the
timbers; and it might also be possible to replace them, if they

$ion or extension- of the brace will be to the descent of a weight connected with the
moveable end of the parallelogram, as the depth of the parallelogram to the length of
the brace, whatever the actual distance of the weight may be; sv that although thestrain
on the horizontal pieces increases with this distance, that which affects the brace is in-
dependent of it; the relative being to the absolute strength as the depth of the frame
is to the length of the brace.
