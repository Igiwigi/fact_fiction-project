It is true that in the case of the interference set-up (both
slits open and there are no counters allowing us to detect through which slit each particle in
question passes), we observe the interference pattern, defined by the zones of permitted or
‘forbidden’ impact. This pattern is strictly statistical in nature, manifesting itself only in a very
large number of trials, around 70000. The statistical nature of this pattern also reflects the fact
that there is no zone of forbidden impact for any individual trial. Any given trial can leave its
mark anywhere on the screen, as is clearly shown by the famous data of A. Tonomura’s single
electron build-up experiments [49].
