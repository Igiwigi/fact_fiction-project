The range of dust/ice ratios by volume might be barely consistent with the
ratio of refractories to volatiles cited above (6, by mass) if the density of the dusty particles is
sufficiently high, but this does highlight the large uncertainties in this most basic of parameters. There was also evidence that the permittivity decreased with depth below the surface, which
could be accounted for by an inward increase either in porosity or in ice/dust ratio [43],
ie. a density that decreases inward. The fact that there are no large voids is not obviously
consistent with hierarchical accretion with late stages involving primarily accretion primarily of
large cometesimals, but this needs further investigation. An increase in porosity with depth is
counterintuitive but not impossible, while an increase in ice/dust ratio with depth is certainly
plausible and if true would suggest selection effects in using measurements of the coma to infer
gas/dust ratios.


(c) What are comets made of? There has been a tremendous increase in our knowledge of what comets are made of, particularly
in the volatiles that are observed as gases in the coma but even in the composition of refractories
that were analysed in situ by COSIMA [45].
