Apparently, however, it is also present in the Hylid Phyllomedusa moschata, in which
Brome described a spherical procartilaginous mass that he took to represent the
cartilago basalis. In this species, as also in P. dacnicolor (of which the female is described
above, p. 448), the cricoid has a broad processus muscularis, which, at least in P. dacni-
color, lies outside m. constrictor laryngis posterior, as in the Australian Hylas and in few
other Anura.* Brume noted that Phyllomedusa stood apart from the remaining
Hylidee known to him, in the structure of the larynx, and also in the fact that the aditus
is directed forwards and not dorsally. In this last feature it further resembles H. awrea
and H. ewingii (but not H. ewrulea). Hyla cerulea and H. ewingii are peculiar in having the cartilago basalis ossified.
