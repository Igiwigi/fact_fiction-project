Q This physiological inquiry is not foreign to the subject of this memoir, but forms an
Io essential part of it, since it gives us some clue, helping us to determine what may and
5 what may not have been Coniferous plants, It affects the position in-which special
b=y genera should be located, besides having a very important bearing upon the general
5 question of evolution. Though at present unable to see my way to the acceptance of
=] this doctrine in connexion with the origin of extinct plant forms, T am anxious to place
S on record all the facts which my studies in palzo-botany supply which appear to
5 support that doctrine. HHitherto the difficulty of explaining the transition from the
S ordinary types of fibro-yascular cells and vessels to that of the discigerous types has
2 been one very great hindrance to my accepting the doctrines of the evolutionists in
S reference to fossil plants ; this one difficulty, at all events, has now been removed. But,
= its removal is also an important fact bearing upon another branch of the present inquiry.
