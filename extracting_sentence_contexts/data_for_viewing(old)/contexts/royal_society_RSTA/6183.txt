then increases until the next modal pattern is formed. In the decreasing region, the instability is
experimentally seen to be subcritical while it is seen to be supercritical in the ascending region [4].
For very large w, however, all discretized modes disappear, and the waves become very choppy
with only saturated stable waves occurring.

For our final set of observations, we return to equation (2.1) which yields a scaled group that
compares gravitational effects to interfacial tension effects. It is [gApw? /y], where W, the width
of a container, determines the allowable wavenumbers. Thus, to have resonant instability with
negligible gravity effects, either g must be made small or W must be made small, i.e. small width
containers must be used. Note that density matching is of no use in reducing the effect of g,
because a density matched bilayer will simply oscillate as a rigid body and resonance would then
not be possible. This is also apparent because the net base pressure difference at the interface, i.e.
Ap[-g + Aw? cos(wt)], is zero when Ap is zero. In fact, the smaller the density difference, the
greater the required amplitude, A, for the onset of the instability, all other variables being held
fixed. Likewise the smaller the width of a container, the greater the sidewall damping and the
greater the forcing amplitude. More observations can be made from equation (2.1). From the
equation, we see that y, the interfacial or surface tension, is multiplied by k?. This means that,
if g were eliminated, we might expect that the onset of the instability in a wide container will be
manifested by choppy waves, i.e. waves with large wavenumber, k. In other words, we ought to
see a shift toward smaller wavelength, yet discrete modes in experiments at low g compared to identical
experiments under Earthâ€™s gravity. We now turn to a theoretical model whose predictions are shown
to be validated by experiments.
