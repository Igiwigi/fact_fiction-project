Art. 15. This main proposition involves the whole theory of the partitions at the
nodes of an incomplete lattice; it gives the true generating function without
redundant terms, and this only needs examination and, where possible, simplification.
Such simplification is apparently always possible when the lattice is complete.
Moreover, there is the task of exhibiting L( ; a, a, a3, ...) a8 a product of outer and
inner lattice functions and of finding the algebraic expression of L,( ; a, ds, ds, ...).
There is an important and quite general property of the lattice function which must
now be explained. If a lattice be read by columns instead of by rows its specification
changes from a partition to the conjugate partition, and it is a trivial remark that the
generating function of partitions at the nodes is not altered. In fact, if the rows
POSSESS ,, My, ..., %, nodes and the columns J,, bg, ..., b, nodes

GF (1; a), ds, ..., dn) = GE (7; by, bs, ..., by).

Moreover, since the generating function is the quotient of the lattice function by
an algebraic function which depends merely upon the number of nodes, it is clear

that
