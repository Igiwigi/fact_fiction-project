I had the advantage a number of years ago of examining some specimens from
Gaspé sent to the late Dr. Kipsron by Dawson and now in the Kidston Collection at
the Geological Survey Museum. A specimen of the fertile region in the Manchester
University Museum yielded some definite information as to the sporangia and the axes
bearing them. To confirm and extend this information the specimens of Gaspé rock,
bearing fertile axes and sporangia and labelled by Dawson “ Psilophyton princeps
(fructification) ” that are in the British Museum Collection were entrusted to me for
examination. I have to express my indebtedness to the authorities of these three
museums for permitting me to examine and describe the specimens.

The study of some of these specimens by modern methods has resulted in the addition
of details to previous descriptions. It is of morphological interest to ascertain all that
can be learnt about these well-defined types of early plant-remains. The facts ascer-
tained also have their bearing on the question whether the two types of remains can be
regarded as parts of the one plant. Further, by adding to the critical characteristics
of the “type specimens ” they will have value when apparently similar remains from
other regions have to be specifically determined. It is an additional source of interest
in these two types of remains that specimens agreeing in general features with them
occur, also in association, in Lower Devonian rocks of regions widely distant from Gaspé.
The present account will, however, be confined to observations made on specimens named
and distributed by Dawson from the original locality in Canada.

The details to be described can be grouped naturally as concerning :—

(1) The spiny shoots and especially the spines.
