Furthermore, collisional perturbations of the absorption profile can
be neglected, because the vapour pressure can be extremely small (approx. 10~4 Pa) [80,81]. On
the other hand, alkali or alkaline-earth metal atoms present other difficulties, including the strong
sensitivity to magnetic fields, the relatively large hyperfine structure and the occurrence of optical
pumping effects, which should be carefully accounted for, when modelling the absorption line
shape. As a matter of fact, most of the DBT experiments, performed more or less successfully in
the last decade, have probed an isolated line of a molecular species. In this respect, advantages
and limitations of the main experiments have been highlighted, also making a thoughtful
comparison among the different molecules. As a result, it seems clear that non-polar molecules,
possibly having strong absorption features in the NIR, should be preferred for many reasons:


collisions are less effective; the refractive index is smaller; moleculesâ€™ adsorption and desorption
from the cell walls are strongly reduced.
