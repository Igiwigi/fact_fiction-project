Centralization of the nervous structures may have
derived from such a net (or net-like) arrangement between
five and nine times in metazoans according to Moroz
[84,103], or at least four according to Northcutt [85]. Among the well-described cases, one paradigmatic
example of the possibility of independent brain origins is
described in the molluscs. Here, we just provide the essential
facts as a good illustration of the evolutionary process, with-
out delving into the details. In a review published by Moroz
[84], he arrives at the conclusion that three or four indepen-
dent events of centralization of the NS have occurred in
Mollusca over evolutionary time. The most basal molluscan
lineages present a NS organization called tetraneury (fig. 2
in [84]) which consists of two pairs of longitudinal nerve
cords, ventral and lateral (with the second pair more dorsally
situated), which are connected through commissures along
the whole body axis [104].
