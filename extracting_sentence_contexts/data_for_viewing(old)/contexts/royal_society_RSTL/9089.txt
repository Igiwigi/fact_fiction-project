ES Characteristic British Fossils* (pl. xxviii. fig. 1), and, still more lately, Mr. CarruTHERs
Ehas figured the same plant with fertile pinnules in the * Geological Magazine,” vol. ix.
ENo. 2, The latter Memoir also contains figures and descriptions of some detached
© sporangia from the Oldham deposit, which its author believes to be of the type found
Sin the recent Hymenophyllew.
During my long-continued researches I have failed to discover a solitary fern-frond
Rin the Coal-measures of Lancashire, Yorkshire, or Durham in which sori were to be seen
in 8itu, and in my large collection of sections I have met with extremely few traces of
detached sporangia. Here and there a fragment of an annulus has been observed, but
too imperfect for identification with any special typed. Mr. BurrerworTH has been

+ Flora de Vorwelt, Taf. Ivii. + Annales des Sciences Nat., 6* 86rie, Bot., tome i. pl. 10.
$ This remarkable fact indicates that the fossil fronds haye been exposed for a long time to the action of
water before they became buried in silt and mud. At the same time, remembering how common fern-fronds
are in the coal-shales, and what myriads of sporangia they must have set free, it is strange that wo do not find

detached ones more abundantly than is the case. (Since the above remarks were penned, I have obtained
additional examples of such sporangia from Messrs. Brxxs and Senxces, of Halifax, —June 2, 1877.)
