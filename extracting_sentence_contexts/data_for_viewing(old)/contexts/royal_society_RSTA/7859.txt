as well as of the corresponding conditions describing general distributions of mass
occurring in the definition of Ny,* (y). In fact, these considerations, together with a
certain geometrical lemma (Theorem 14), will elucidate the whole nature of the
function Ny, (7).

CoroLitaryt—If is closed, bounded, and convex, and if y + MM, then Ny (») > 1.
For there is a closed half-plane § for which #%,» « §. Since % is bounded,
there is a closed circle € satisfying 9% C_ € C § and hence »y « 6. ‘Therefore, by
Theorem 3,

Nx (9) = Ne (9) > 1.

The next question of course is whether N,, (_y) is continuous. In fact, we show
that Ny, (9), regarded as a function of y, satisfies the following Lipschitz condition.
