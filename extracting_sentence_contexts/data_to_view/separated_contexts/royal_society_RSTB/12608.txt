Virescent mutants are a class of plastid-defective mutants
which exhibit a slow-greening phenotype, in which young
cells in leaf primordia and at the proximal region of developing
leaves show reduced chlorophyll accumulation compared with
more mature, distal cells. The few virescent mutants for which
the molecular basis has been identified are defective in plastid
protein homeostasis [7,8] or are auxotrophs for plastid-based
nucleotide metabolism [9]. Plastids being central hubs of
metabolism in plants and hosts to a very large proportion of
cellular protein explains the fact that many metabolic defects
will manifest first as plastid biogenesis deficiencies. A genetic
effort to identify components involved in light signalling on
the basis of its control of chloroplast development [10] led to
the identification of a number of cab-underexpressed (cue)
mutants, several among which exhibited a virescent phenotype
[11]. In one of those mutants, the ultrastructure of plastids
showed a transition from proplastid to fully differentiated
chloroplast which is difficult to capture in wild-type (WT)
plants.
