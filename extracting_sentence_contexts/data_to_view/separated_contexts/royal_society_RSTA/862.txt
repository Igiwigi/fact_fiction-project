One contribution of 17 to a discussion meeting
issue ‘Foundations of quantum mechanics and
their impact on contemporary society’

Subject Areas:

quantum physics, optics Recent interest in quantum communications has
stimulated great technological progress in satellite

Keywords: quantum technologies. These advances have rendered

the aforesaid technologies mature enough to support
the realization of experiments that test the foundations
of quantum theory at unprecedented scales and in
the unexplored space environment. Such experiments,
Author for correspondence: in fact, could explore the boundaries of quantum
Paolo Villoresi theory and may provide new insights to investigate
phenomena where gravity affects quantum objects. Here, we review recent results in satellite quantum
communications and discuss possible phenomena
that could be observable with current technologies. Furthermore, stressing the fact that space represents
an incredible resource to realize new experiments
aimed at highlighting some physical effects, we
challenge the community to propose new experiments
that unveil the interplay between quantum mechanics
and gravity that could be realizable in the near future.
