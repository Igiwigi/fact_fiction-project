It cannot be doubted that cytoplasm also
passes over into the oosphere, for each generative nucleus in the pollen tube is

clearly surrounded by its own layer of cytoplasm, as can be observed in the stage

when the tube is already in contact with the oosphere. It may here be noticed that

small bodies staining deeply with fuchsin §. may be observed in the generative

cell protoplasm. In fact they exactly resemble the bodies found in many meriste-—

matic cells, and freely set down as plastids. We cannot, of course, trace any con-
nection with starch formation, but there is as much justification for calling these
bodies leucoplasts as exists in many other cases. If leucoplasts are really present in
the protoplasm of male generative cells, the general view that the male cell brings
over no plastids to the egg appears to be directly contradicted.
