I have beforet pointed
out the bearing that the position of the Rubble-drift should have in limiting our
estimate of the time elapsed since the close of the Glacial period. In a paper already
eferred to I had shown cause why that time was not to be measured by Dr. Croxtâ€™s
eckoning of 80,000 years, as not being supported by the facts of geology. The
position and character of the Rubble-drift show that the transition from the
so-called Post-glacial beds to the recent Alluvial deposits is very abrupt, and that
there is an absence of sedimentation or of anything indicative of lapse of time
etween those two series. This conclusion is confirmed by the sections of the Belgian
caves.
