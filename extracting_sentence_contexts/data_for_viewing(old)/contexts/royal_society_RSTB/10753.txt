of opportunity) and constraints (usually physiological limitations requiring

Subject Areas: that fact that the evolution of large brains required energetic, physiological
behaviour, evolution, neuroscience and time budget constraints to be overcome. In some cases, this was reflected
in the evolution of ‘smart foraging’ and technical intelligence, but in many
cases required the evolution of behavioural competences (such as coalition
