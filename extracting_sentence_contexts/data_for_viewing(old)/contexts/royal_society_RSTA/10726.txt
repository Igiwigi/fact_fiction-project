there were significant changes in the personal equations of the three observers
between the first and second moiety of the experiments. While Dr. Ler (1) bettered
her judgment by -004, Mr. Yune (3) swung over from ‘001 to right of true midpoint
to 010 to left of midpoint, and I had a worse judgment by ‘005 in the second
moiety when compared with the first moiety of the results.

In the ease of the second series with the bright line, Dr. Macponeut (2) and I (1)
have changes slightly for the better in our judgments between the 266 first experi-
ments and the 258 second experiments; but having regard to the probable errors
given for 260 experiments, it may be doubted whether these changes are significant.
Dr. Ler (3) has, however, a quite significant change for the worse.

The fact that in some cases the personal equation grows less, in others greater, in
the second half of the series seems to indicate that the changes in personal equation
were by no means due toa secular improvement in judgment.* Nor do they admit
of explanation on the assumption of increasing fatigue due to the exhaustion of the
power of attention. It must be remembered that the experiments were spread out
over a number of days, and this cause would only influence the latter experiments
on each day. My worst experiments on the bright line are the Series 321-347 and
504-520 (Observer (1) Column () Table TV.), but they are much above the average
in goodness for Dr. Lez (Observer (3) Column (a@)), and above the average for
Dr. Macponett. Dr. Macponett’s worst results are 186 to 239 (Observer (2)
Column (a) ), and these, especially 213 to 239, are bad for Dr. Ler, but they are
very good results so far as I am concerned. If any fluctuation was accordingly
due to fatigue, it did not affect us alike.
