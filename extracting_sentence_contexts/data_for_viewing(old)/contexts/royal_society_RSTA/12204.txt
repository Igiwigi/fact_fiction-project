Younc-SEtLMEIER type, involving perhaps change of effective inertia, which y
take a more complete account of the sympathetic interaction which occurs betwee
the electric vibrations of the molecules and the vibrations of the medium, when
periods are very nearly alike.

The sum of the orders of the differential coefficients in any term of the energ:
must usually be even; a term in which it is odd would introduce unilateral qualit
into the medium, typified by such phenomena as rotatory polarization; and it i
known from the facts and principles of crystalline structure that such terms can b
when existent at all, only of a very minute residual kind.

When we come to discuss the problem of reflexion, the surface-terms derived fron
the variation of the energy-function must be retained, and they should be adjusted g
as to maintain the continuity of the manifestations of energy in crossing the interface,
But the dispersional terms will introduce into the variational equation surface
integrals involving not only 8€, 8y, SZ, but also 6 (d&/da), 8 (d*é/da*),....; and y
cannot even attempt to make all these independent terms continuous across th
interface. We therefore cannot follow in our analysis the complete circumstances ¢
the problem of reflexion. This is not cause for surprise, because the essence of
method of continuous analysis consists of averaging the molecular discreteness of
medium ; and we are now trying to fit this analysis on to conditions at an interface
