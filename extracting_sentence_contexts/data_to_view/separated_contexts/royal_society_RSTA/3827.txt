We first focus on the simulations with the graphite model Yg1. The JC and EPP models of steel
give very similar results, and quantitative agreement with experiments is observed in regime R1. This is simply due to the fact that, as discussed in ยง3b, the projectile remains roughly spherical in
this regime even with the JC model. The PPD is thus directly related to the graphite yield stress. Regime R2 is more complex, because plastic deformation of the projectile becomes important and
also plays a role in the PPD computation.
