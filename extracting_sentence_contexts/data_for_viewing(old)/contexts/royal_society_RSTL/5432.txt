that the pure water which first occupies the pores of the septum, suffers a sudden and
great loss of its capillarity-force when the salt of the osmometer enters the pores by
diffusion and mixes with the water they contain. Experiments published by DuTRro-
CHET give a capillary ascension to pure water of 12 millimeters, and to a solution of
common salt, of density 1-12, 6:14 millimeters, or only one-half of the former ascen-
sion. If a porous septum, occupied by such a saline solution, had the same s0lution
in contact with one surface and pure water in contact with the other surface (the
actual condition of the septum in an osmotic experiment), the pure water should
enter the pores from its high capillary attraction, and, like a s0lid piston, force out
the saline solution from them : the saline solution 80 displaced would go to swell the
liquid within the osmometer. When the pure water, now again occupying the pores,
came in time to acquire salt by diffusion, the displacement would be repeated, and a
continuous osmose or flow of water inwards be in fact established.

This explanation is attended with certain physical difficulties, but it is unnecessary
to discuss these, as the experimental basis of the hypothesis is unsound. The great
inequality of capillarity assumed among aqueous fluids does not exist. Many saline
80lutions which give rise to the highest osmose are, I find, undistinguishable in capil-
larity from pure water itself. To obtain constant results with saline soJutions, the
capillary tube must be retained for s0me minutes in the saline solution at a boiling
temperature, and afterwards be cooled without removal from the liquid, otherwise
the indications are singularly irregular and most fallacious.

The near equality in capillarity of solutions of the most different composition is
very apparent in my observations, which are placed together in the following series
