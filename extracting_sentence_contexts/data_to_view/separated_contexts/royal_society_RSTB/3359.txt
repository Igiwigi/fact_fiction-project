The first four injections, involving a total of over 0Â°006 grm. per
kilogramme, produced practically no effect on the respirations. Failure of respiration
did not occur until after injection of the last dose, when the blood-pressure had
fallen to below 30 mm. of mercury, at which time impairment of respiration was
adequately explained by the great fall of blood-pressure. This is a corroboration of
the fact which we have previously emphasised, namely, that there is no evidence that
Echis venom contains a neurotoxin acting on the central nervous system. The effects of this venom on blood-pressure offer a striking contrast to the effects
of Cobra and Sepedon venoms. In the case of the latter venoms the effects on
respiration are of primary importance, failure of the circulation being largely
consequent upon respiratory failure.
