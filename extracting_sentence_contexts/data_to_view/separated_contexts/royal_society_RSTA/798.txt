The inclusion of higher-order effects, or simply
more modes may be necessary. Nevertheless, we believe the dynamics of the simplest occurring
interaction—the degenerate quartet here considered—provide a blueprint for more complex,
physically relevant cases to be considered in future work. The fact that the presence of inhomogeneous disturbances in an otherwise homogeneous wave

field sets up fluctuations in wave energy in (x, f)-space indicates that the corresponding statistics : =
of wave height will also be altered. For recurrent dynamics, the resulting energy distribution may : a
be extended to arbitrary times, while for non-recurrent dynamics the computations have been 73
performed for an interaction time of approximately 500 wave periods. Assuming that the wave aes
heights of the homogeneous sea are Rayleigh distributed, the presence of inhomogeneities yields 22
up to an 11-fold increase in encounter probability for freak waves twice the significant wave [4
height.
