The high-pressure furnace seemed to us therefore particularly suitable for studying
this question, the advantages to be gained consisting firstly in the complete protec-
tion of the products from oxidation, and secondly in the decreased volatilisation which
might be expected under the high gaseous pressures. Some of the experiments tried under pressure to study this problem are given in
Table VIIL., details of one experiment being reproduced in Table IX. By a cursory inspection of Table VIII. the two following facts may at once be
deduced :—

(1) That in the resistance furnace neither aluminium nor its carbide is produced.

(2) That on the other hand all are furnaces give a more or less marked reduction ;
although it will be noticed (in section B) that the product chiefly occurs as carbide of
aluminium. In several cases small malleable lumps of the metal were condensed in the powdered
material surrounding the fused product. From this it would appear that the required conditions for which we are searching
had for some short period been accidentally fulfilled—these conditions being the
rapid removal of the metal vapour from the reduction zone and its condensation
under circumstances which precluded carburisation.
