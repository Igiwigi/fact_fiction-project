6., in general, such as are
deeply coloured. Moreover, just as in the case of reflex action, 8 in this case, the wave
of stimulation may be started from some tracts more certainly than from others,
although there is no constancy as to the position of these tracts in different indivi-
duals. - As showing the identity of the wave of stimulation in this case and in that
of reflex action, I may mention the following fact. When a single lithocyst is left in
8i7u and a point in the neryo-muscular sheet at a distance from the lithocyst is gently
irritated, if the passage of the stimulus happens to be marked by the above-described
occurrence of what we may term a tentacular wave, it is always observable that the
lithocyst never originates its reflex response until after the tentacular waye has reached
it, and that it then inyariably does 80 when the requisite period of latent stimulation
has elapsed, viz. about half a second after the arrival of the tentacular wave.
