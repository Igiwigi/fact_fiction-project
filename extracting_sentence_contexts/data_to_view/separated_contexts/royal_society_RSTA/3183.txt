Another
significant circumstance is that, whilst excess of hydrogen always produced a
continuous acceleration throughout a given experiment, any acceleration due to an

excess of oxygen was only manifested during the initial stages. These facts suggest
the following view of the catalytic process. Porous porcelain occludes, or condenses,
both hydrogen and oxygen at rates which depend to some extent upon the physical
condition and past history of the surface. In general, however, whereas in the case
of oxygen the process is extremely rapid and the surface layer is soon saturated, the
occlusion of hydrogen is slower and the limit of saturation much higher.
