A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 401

other. And until this is practically accomplished, and can be practically re-
peated, I do not think that the true length of the seconds pendulum can be
considered as satisfactorily determined.

Reduction to a vacuum.

M. BxssEL has shown, in his very interesting work on the pendulum #, that
the usual formula for the reduction to a vacuum, as far as the specific gravity
of the moving body is concerned, is very defective; and by no means expresses
the whole of the correction which ought to be applied : in fact, that a quan-
tity of air is also set in motion by, and adheres to, the pendulum (varying
according to its form and construction), and thus a compound pendulum is in
all cases produced, the specific gravity of which will be much less than that of
the metal itself. He states (page 32) that © if we denote by mz the mass of a
* body moving through a fluid, and by mz the mass of the fluid displaced
thereby, the accelerating force acting on the body has, since the time of
m—m
