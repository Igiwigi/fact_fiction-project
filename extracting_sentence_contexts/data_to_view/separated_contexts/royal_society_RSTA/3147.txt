Xu et al. [29] consider travelling wave solutions to lattice Hamiltonian systems and study a
condition for a pair of eigenvalues associated with the PDE system to cross zero and emerge on
the real axis, thus leading to spectral instability. The authors perform their study following two
different approaches: one based on Floquet multipliers, and one that is Hamiltonian-based. The
article [29] and a previous one from the same authors [31] distinguish themselves from other
works on lattice equations by the fact that no tools from integrability are used for the stability
analysis. Two examples of lattice dynamical system problems that have solitary wave solutions
that change stability are considered. One of the examples involves the a-FPU (Fermi—Pasta—Ulam)
lattice with exponentially decaying long-range Kac-Baker interactions, while the other example
concerns a smooth regularization of the FPU problem.
