details above described, and I consider it to be the most important result of this
investigation. But it is our duty not only to contemplate possible views, but to decide which is,
in our own opinion, the more probable. Having in view, in addition to the facts
from paleontology and from the study of development, the comparison with other
Pteridophyta and the facts from septate anthers of Angiosperms, it seems to me
probable that a progressive septation has taken place in certain types of Maratiiacez,
where the sori are elongated, such as Danwa, and in a less degree Marattia and
Kaulfussia. It may be a question how far a similar septation may be accountable
for the origin in the first instance of a sorus with a plurality of sporangia united
together, as in Asterotheca, though I think this not improbably the mode of their
origin. I am disposed to regard such synangial types as being probably the more
primitive, and to think that a progressive separation of the individual sporangia has
led from these to such a type as Angiopteris or Hawlea.
