'= usually extremely thin. At Bermuda, Millepora alcicornis is frequently found encrust-

@ easily be detached in flakes from the glass, and does not measure more than from 4

i= a Gorgonia are found entirely encrusted with a thin film of 1zilepora, 0 thin that the
= fenestrations of the horny meshwork of the Gorgonia are not obliterated. Such thin
Z encrusting films, if obtained in the living condition, would, no doubt, be excellently
iS! adapted for the study of the soft parts of Jillepora, since they are thin enough to
5 transmit a considerable amount of light. When dead and dry they show extremely
A well the ramifications of the canal-systems and their connexions with the calicles. In
such films the calicles, larger and smaller, are fully developed, though necessarily very
shallow ; and it is evident that such a thin film of corallum is all that is absolutely
necessary for the existence of the M1illepora, and, in fact, in all Millepore it is sach a
thin film only which is actually living, covering the surface of the corallum. In a
Millepora forming tubercular or ramified masses a superposition of a series of such
films takes place and constitutes the coral mass.
In the films encrusting bottles the under surface in contact with the glass is perfectly
