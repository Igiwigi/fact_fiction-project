general history of the migration of birds. The order in
which they appear and disappear, their respective habits, and
many other observations, have been given with considerable
accuracy by several naturalists, who have paid attention to
this very curious subject. It is with a view of representing
some facts, hitherto unnoticed, chiefly with respect to the
cause, which excites the bird, at certain seasons of the year,
to quit one country for another, that I communicate the
following pages to this learned body.

But before I proceed to state my observations on this head,
it may be necessary to adduce some arguments first, in $up-
