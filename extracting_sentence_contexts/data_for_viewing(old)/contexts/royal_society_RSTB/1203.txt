The employment of the galvanometric method to estimate quantitatively the

excitatory state of the nerve channels or fibres in the cord led us to attempt to
apply it as a gauge of the conditions prevailing in and between the spinal centres.

Even a careful review of the history of the subject fails to show absolutely more
than a few facts from which knowledge of the actually intracentral processes may be
drawn. We will now present in a brief sketch what is understood from anatomical
and physiological evidence to fairly represent the structure and functional activity
of simple nerve centres, such as those in the spinal cord, in order that the bearing
of our own observations may be more comprehensible.

& The most recent anatomical investigations by Gote1, HeLp, Fiucuste, and others,
Griefly by means of the methods of staining devised by Gouct, have established the
