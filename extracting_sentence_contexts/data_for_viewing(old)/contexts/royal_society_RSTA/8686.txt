molecular rotatory power of the acid is plotted against the percentage by weight of
water in the solution, the curves are seen to be inflected, but the deviations from the
linear law, though quite real, are by no means conspicuous. More remarkable still is
the fact, which Bror discovered in 1850, that extrapolation by means of the linear law
leads to substantially correct values for the specific rotatory power of the anhydrous
glassy or amorphous acid. In our own calculations we have used, for each of a series
of nine wave-lengths, a linear formula based on the values for the specific rotatory powers
of the acid in solutions containing 55 and 85 per cent. of water; the rotatory powers
of the anhydrous acid, as shown under e = 0 in Table IL., are derived by interpolation
from the observations of Brunar (‘ Trans. Faraday Soc.,’ 1914, vol. 10, p. 89), and
the differences between the observed and calculated values are :—

1°2, 1°5, 1-6, 1:7, 1-7, 1-7, 1-8, 0°6°, Mean 1°5°.

This agreement is remarkably close, having regard to the facts that (i.) the linear law
is only an approximation, (ii.) the extrapolation covers nearly half of the total range of
