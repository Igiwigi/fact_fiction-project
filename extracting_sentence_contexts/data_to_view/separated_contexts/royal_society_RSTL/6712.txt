The
tangents of the two curves can, it is clear, only meet on the line of intersection of the
planes of the curyes; and the construction of the Torse is in fact as follows: from any
point of the line of intersection draw a tangent to mz and a tangent to 72, then the line
Joining the points of contact of these tangents is a generating line of the Torse. The
order of the Torse is equal to the number of generating lines which meet an arbitrary
line; and taking for the arbitrary line the line of intersection of the two planes, it is
easy to see that the only generating lines which meet the line of intersection are those
for which one of the points of contact lies on the line of intersection ; that is, they are

the generating lines derived from the points in which the line of intersection meets one
or other of the two curyes; they are therefore in fact the tangents drawn to the curve
from the points in which the line of intersection meets the curye m, together with the
tangents drawn to the curye m from the points in which the line of intersection meets
the curve n. Now the line meets the curve 2 in 7 points, and from each of these there
are tangents to the curye 1; and it meets the curye 12 in m points, and from each of
these there are » tangents to the curye 2; hence the entire number of the tangents in
question is =n&+mv, which confirms the theorem. F Annex No. 5.—Order of 'Torse (12?) (referred to, Art. 46).
