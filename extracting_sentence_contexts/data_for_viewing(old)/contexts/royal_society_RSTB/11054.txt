information on average TL; need to standardize
restriction enzymes used to compare studies
between laboratories (subtelomeric polymorphisms
can alter data obtained); labour intensive

labour intensive; TLs expressed as relative fluorescence 34]
units (not actually TLs) but using standards
measured by TRF actual TLs can be inferred

does not distinguish telomere clustering in interphase 35]
cells; does not recognize telomere-free ends

requires an expensive FACS instrument; almost 39,40]
universally uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs)

does not detect the telomeres that are very short that 34]

do not hybridize with probes (appear as telomere-
free ends); requires highly skilled cytogeneticist for
chromosome-specific analyses

works on only a small subset of individual human [51]
chromosomes; low throughput; labour intensive
