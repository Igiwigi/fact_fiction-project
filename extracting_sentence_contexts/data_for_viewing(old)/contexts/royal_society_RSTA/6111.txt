other words, Spys,}41/(L8c] + 1) = Sf/8e = S(p mod q)/p must be integer. A similar analysis for the 28

communities of size |5,| leads to S(q — p mod q)/p €N. If S fulfils the first condition, fulfilling the [8

second requires Sq/p € N and, therefore, S must be a multiple of p, given that p and q are coprime. DR
To conclude this section, we note that periodicity in the entanglement structure, as the one

we have discussed here for finite-size systems, can also be found in infinite spin systems when

a defect is inserted in the chain. This phenomenon is due to the fact that local impurities break

the natural spatial symmetry of the infinite chain. In [64], the authors show spatial modulation in

concurrence, similar to the one predicted for the finite open-boundary case, for an infinite system

with local impurity.

The characterization and analysis of the properties of many-body quantum states is a daunting
