They take a similar
approach to [10] and simulate a specific scheduler using job run time predictions. However, as
they assume the Maui scheduler [12] which is not widely used anymore, and as they base their
work on simulations of the scheduler, their work cannot be applied in our case. Gao et al. [13] use a genetic algorithm to optimize job scheduling, however their approach does
not apply to us due to the fact that we need to estimate job queue wait time probabilities. Chen
et al. [14] use Naive Bayes, but in a different context, namely optimizing MapReduce partitioner. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the well-known technique of Naive Bayes
classification.
