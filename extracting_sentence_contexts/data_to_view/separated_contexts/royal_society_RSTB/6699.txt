The stock of the X virus which originated from the isolation by Dr Kenneth Smith
some ten years ago, and which has passed under the stock number 723, has been carried
through several hundreds of passages as exhibited in tens of thousands of tobacco and
Datura plants. It was never selected as a strain, severe or otherwise, but such parts of
a plant as showed outstanding symptoms were automatically used as the inoculum
for the next passage. In consequence of this unconscious and prolonged selection a
type of reaction in the test plants has now been attained and become standardized
which is, in fact, identical with that produced by a purified S strain. Even after all these years this particular 723 stock is not a pure strain of XÂ° but
contains traces of the G strain as will be shown later. Although the original source of
the virus was an Up-to-date potato and was carrying the characteristic Up-to-date
streak or B virus as well as the X virus Bawden has shown that some of the derivative
lines retained this latter whilst others lost it on passage.
