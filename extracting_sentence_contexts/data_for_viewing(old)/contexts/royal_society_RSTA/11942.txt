hardly, I think, be accomplished until a more perfect notation is discovered.”

Scuriruit has discovered a notation of great merit which affords a powerful
method of dealing with the twenty-seven lines; it is based upon the selection of
some twelve of the lines which form a “double six.” The author of this paper
endeavoured to find a notation for the twenty-seven lines, which did not depend on
any special selection among them. He hopes that the method he has adopted of
representing by a plane diagram the intersection or non-intersection of the twenty-
seven lines with each other will be found of some interest.

Four distinct forms of the diagram are given: one will be found of more use for
one purpose, and another for another; although each contains everything that is
contained in the others. In fact, one is obtained from another by purely clerical
alteration.

The contents of this paper may be stated shortly as follows :-—

In $1 it is shown that the equation of the general cubic surface may be thrown
