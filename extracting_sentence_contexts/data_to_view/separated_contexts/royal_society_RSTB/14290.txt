However, a subgroup of
abstract words that has not been considered so far, are religious words such as
mercy, blessing or holy. Similar to other abstract words, they are situation-
embedded as well but require a specific contextualization by a social group that
knows their meaning [3]. The subgroup of religious abstract words is attractive
because it highlights the fact that a practice of applying the words needs to be
established by a social group [4]. So abstract words are not only interesting for
psycholinguistic studies on how they are represented and processed but also
for other disciplines like religious education. In research on religious education, there is a long-lasting discussion about
the role that religious words have on religious behaviour.
