We found that the PBC model accurately predicts the osmotic pressure of these
dispersions as they are slowly concentrated to intermediate volume fractions, but that some
discrepancies arose at higher salt concentrations (10-50mM), where the model systematically
under-predicted the osmotic pressures of the dispersions. Drying experiments were then conducted in Hele-Shaw cells, where SAXS techniques were
used to measure how the particle volume fraction changes across the liquid-solid transitions
of directionally drying colloidal dispersions. We found that the numerical model of the front
correctly captured much of the experimental detail, such as (i) the general shape of the drying
front, especially for the smaller particles, (ii) the fact that the concentration profiles across the
liquid-solid transition were stretched to be about an order of magnitude wider than would be
expected for particles with only hard-sphere interactions, and (iii) that this stretching of the front
was stronger for larger particles. However, many of the fine details of the concentration profiles
were missed. Most notably, when the drying profiles were used to infer an effective diffusivity
of the various dispersions, it was found that the colloidal particles showed a marked increase in
their collective diffusivity at intermediate-to-high volume fractions, where they were behaving
as a yield-stress material, like a paste or gel, rather than a simple fluid.
