The state of differentiation of the tissues of the outer and inner cylinder indicates
clearly that the latter is of later origin. Figures 99 and 100, plate 13, illustrate the structure
and mode of inception of the inner cylinder. It has, in fact, been developed from paren-
chymatous cells which initially constituted the medulla or pith of the solenostele of the
primary bud. Typical parenchymatous cells can still be seen in the centre of the inner
cylinder, but in the peripheral region of the pith growth and division of the parenchymatous
cells, mainly by tangential walls, have taken place and a cambium-like tissue has been formed

and are in the course of developing into tracheides.
