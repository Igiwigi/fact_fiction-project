order similar to that which prevails on the surface of the cortex.

From what has been already done in this matter it is evident that the problem can
be attacked in two different ways, either by stimulation of the motor fibres of the
internal capsule, or by removing different parts of the so-called motor cortex, and
tracing downwards the degeneration produced in the motor fibres through the internal
capsule and crus cerebri,

In this present paper, we have employed only the former of these two methods,
viz., electrical stimulation of the fibres of the internal capsule, as exposed in horizontal
section of the hemisphere. Some knowledge of the arrangement of the fibres in the
internal capsule has already been gained by experimental and anatomical research,
and the facts as known at the present time we will now summarise.

Hisroricat, INTRODUCTION.

Previous writers, on this question, have investigated the subject by several methods
in different kinds of animals, viz., Rodents, Carnivora, Monkeys, and Man. The
methods employed were for the most part anatomical, or consisted in tracing paths of
degeneration. Very rarely has excitation been resorted to. Considering the varied
mode in which movement is represented in the cortex of the brain in different animals,
we have thought it best to arrange the facts we have deduced from the above
researches under the headings of the various species of the animal examined, in the
order already given.
