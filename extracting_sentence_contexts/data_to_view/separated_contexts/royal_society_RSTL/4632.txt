Hence the elevation of the line of maximum fall would appear to he about 4500 feet,
and above this level the supply of rain is diminished ; Mahabuleshwur, Mercara and
Uttray Mullay, although differing greatly in latitude, lie nearly in the same meridian,
and are all at the same elevation. The comparative small fall at Mercara is ac-
counted for by the fact of its not being 80 near the western scarp of the Ghats as
Mababulesbwur and Uttray Mullay, and the effect of a station being placed a few

miles east, of the Ghats upon the fall of rain has already been shown at Mahabu-

Â© leshwur and Paunchgunny, the latter place being eleven miles eastward of the former,
and at a lower level of only 500 feet, yet the mean fall of 15 years at Mababuleshwur
was 254'05 inches, and of the latter 50'69 inches. In 1849 the contrast was till
greater, the fall at Mahabuleshwur amounting to the enormous quantity of 338'38
inches, while at Paunchgunny only 58 inches fell.
