In the past two decades, scientists studying plant—microbe interactions have
identified a number of plant PRRs that function in the recognition of microbial
pathogens and modulate innate immune responses [7], including FLS2-
perceiving flg22, a short peptide of bacterial flagella [8]; EFR-sensing bacterial
elongation factor Tu [9]; CERK1-detecting chitin of fungal cells [10]; LYM-
sensing peptidoglycan [11] and LORE-sensing lipopolysaccharides [12].
Although it is well known that plant pathogenic bacteria react to various stimu-
lations of host plants [13,14], the biochemical mechanism by which bacterial
cells sense plant chemicals or plant-derived cues remains largely unknown.
Especially, the specific receptor—ligand interaction between host and pathogen
has not been well established through studies that combine multi-discipline
approaches. In fact, knowledge about bacterial sensing will provide insights
into the molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis, which facilitates the
rational design of novel approaches to fight these important pathogens.
