Menispermites dentatus Hmrr. Plate 11, fig. 112.

The specimen from Igdlukunguak (fig. 112) is a piece of a peltate leaf characterised
by the presence of several primary veins radiating from an eccentrically placed petiole ;
the lower part of the very slightly cordate lamina is entire, but the upper portion is not
preserved. The veins below the petiolar scar are more slender than those above it ;
the lower veins bend upwards and form loops near the margin, a feature more clearly
shown in the specimen figured by Her. An examination of the type-fossil in the
Copenhagen Museum convinced me of its specific identity with the larger impression
shown in fig. 112. The lamina is torn and there is no reason to suppose that it was
originally trilobed, as Heer described it. KrassEr§ considered M. dentatus to be a
stipule of a Liriodendron leaf, but this is very improbable, even apart from the fact that
we have no real evidence of the occurrence of Liriodendron in the Cretaceous vegetation of
Greenland.

In the radially disposed veins the Igdlukunguak fossil agrees with Nelumbium and
several Menispermaceous species. Hexr described an incomplete leaf from the same
locality as Nelumbium arcticum,|| which differs from Menispermites dentatus in the greater
breadth of the veins and in the presence of a median rib. The type-specimen of the
Nelumbium, in the Copenhagen Museum, is not very accurately represented ; the spreading
veins are not all equal; there is a stronger central rib and the others are shown as less
prominent and rather faintly marked black lines. Hxer’s specimen and others from
