For comparison with these results obtained
by integration, the actual drag, lateral force, and yawing moments were measured on
the aerodynamic balance. The drag at zero yaw was determined with the model
supported on wires ; for measuring the other quantities the model was supported on a
spindle, the necessary corrections being applied for the effect of the spindle.

(b) Measurements of the Pressures on a S pheroid spinning about a Minor Axis.

15. As in the previous case, a length of composition tubing was inserted in the spheroid,
but in view of the fact that in these experiments the model was moving relative to the
earth, a special seal had to be constructed to transmit the pressures to the manometer. * * Experiments in a Wind Channel on Elongated Bodies of approximately Streamline Form. Part I.”
