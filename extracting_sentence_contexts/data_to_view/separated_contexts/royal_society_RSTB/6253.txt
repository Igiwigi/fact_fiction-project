7—Changes in the Uterine Mucosa in Contact with the Egg Surface, studied in situ

Making allowances for shrinkage during fixation, decalcification, and embedding,
there appears to be every reason to suppose that normally the uterine mucosa lies

always in intimate contact with the developing shell during the secretory phases,
apart from transient periods when muscular activity may lead to a reorientation of
different areas of the uterine epithelium in relation to the surface of the membrane. It is a matter of common observation that the oviduct undergoes great distension
as the egg increases in size and, in the uterus particularly, the musculature contracts
in a most remarkable way when the uterine wall is cut and the egg is released from
the lumen. In his explanation of the ovoid form of the hen’s egg, D’Arcy
Tuompson (1917) assumes that muscular tension and peristaltic contraction are the
principal factors in determining its shape, though the details of his theory are limited
by the fact that he was not aware that the egg proceeds through the oviduct with its
pointed end foremost, and then undergoes rotation within the uterus just before
laying, so that the blunt end is finally directed caudalwards. In all the material fixed with an egg in situ and not injected with fixative through
the uterine wall, areas in each section may be found where the larger uterine folds
are flattened into intimate contact with the surface of the egg, figs. 32 and 33, Plate 20.
