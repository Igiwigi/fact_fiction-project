The estimated inten-
sity of sightings (spatial intensity) also strongly supported the
plausibility of our proposed prawn habitat ranges (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). Consistent with our hypothesis, the overall odds of schisto-
some infection increased within dammed catchments, with the
highest increases overall among dams situated within native
prawn habitat (figure 1, red diamonds). This effect was statis-
tically supported by the fact that odds ratios for after:before
dam building differed significantly among the three scenarios
(p < 0.0001)—i.e. among (i) catchments within prawn habitat,
(ii) undammed watersheds, and (iii) catchments outside prawn
habitat. Those catchments located within prawn habitat had
overall ORs after:before of 2.8 (2.7—2.9 Cl) for S. haematobium
and 4.4 (3.6-5.3 CI) for S. mansoni, (figure 1, red diamonds),
demonstrating a strong overall increase in schistosomiasis. By contrast, undammed watersheds in nearby prawn habitat
experienced overall schistosomiasis declines across the same
time periods — ORs after:before 0.90 (0.88—0.91 CI) for S. haem-
atobium and 0.75 (0.73-0.78 CI) for S. mansoni (figure 1, red
diamonds).
