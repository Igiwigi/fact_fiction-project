two months, and in the last two months of the year, some hours before the time of
sunrise; as the sun rises above the horizon and approaches the meridian, evaporation
increases, and the air constantly receives a greater quantity of vapour, consequently
the temperature of the dew-point increases till, at about the time of the maximum
temperature of the air, the maximum temperature of the dew-point takes place, In
Summer time the minimum temperature of the dew-point attains its minimum a little
before sunrise, and its maximum at about noon. In winter time, after having at-
tained its maximum, the temperature of the dew-point decreases very regularly till
next morning. In summer time the value remains very nearly at its maximum value
till after the temperature of the air begins to decline; it then very regularly decreases
as before, till the following morning.

The fact of the almost stationary temperature of the dew-point during the early
afternoon hours in summer is important, and will be referred to again presently.
