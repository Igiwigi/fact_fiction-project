ridge has a diameter of about ‘15 millim. Sometimes the centres of calcification
appear in transverse section even closer together than ‘03 millim., and then they may
be looked upon as almost coalescent. Short rows of such closely-placed centres
produce the elliptical appearance represented in fig. 294. The application of higher
magnifying power, however, shows that the elliptical centre is in reality a combination
of centres, It follows that the ridges on opposite surfaces of the septum in Goniastraa
are structurally composed of several very small, uniformly-developed trabeculse
(cf. fig. 18D).

Correlated with the small size of the trabeculz is the fact that the granulations on
the ridges seldom correspond to a fuscicle of fibres emerging from a single trabecula ;
they usually represent the coalesced fascicles passing out from the ridge-series of
trabecule. Examples of small and large granulations can be studied in the accom-
panying sections.

Transverse sections of the septal pali offer nothing different from the septa. One
or two ridges may be included in a single palus, and the structural appearance is the
same as in the septal ridges.

Transverse Section of Wall (= Pseudotheca).

The thick parts of the septa coalesce laterally to form the wall. The trabeculs in
