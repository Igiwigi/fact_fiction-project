ſeveral other marks were fixed, up, and. the-mean, of

circle. . Now PC being = 2,991 miles, or 2/ 3777 of
a great circle, theangle NPC is = 89? 58” 55//; from

a C, or the diſtance of the parallel PCR at C, ſouth

a rule, in dividing the provinces of Pennſylvania and
Maryland, to trace, out the parallels of latitude by the
obſervations taken, with the aſtronomical ſeRor only,
the ſeftor, was put, up. at, P and S/ſucceſlively, (ſee
fig. 1.). and the zenith diſtances of the ſtars'Capella

whence the point $ was concluded to be 43 yards on
129 feet = S Q more northerly than, P; and thence
it was found by, calculation, that the parallel of latis,
tude PQ at the point C ſhould, be 45: feet, =aC
diſtant, from the great circle P'S, and to the ſouth, of
the ſame, and, the. point C was placed accordingly,

it follows, that had the poſition'of the point C' been
determined by. the *latter tmethod,” inſtead of 'the for-
mer,' it /would have been” placed 47,4 feet 'more
to the northward'than' it was found by the ſector;
and, in' conſequence, the length of the degree of la-
titude would have come out 21 feet longer. But the
difference is ſo ſmall, that it only ſerves to confirm the
