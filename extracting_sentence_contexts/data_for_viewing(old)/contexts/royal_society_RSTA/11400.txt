E strated to be inherited, and this, both through the male and female line, so far as
“we can judge, with an equal intensity. The apparent value of this intensity, except
gin the case of latent characters, is much below that required by the law of ancestral
5 heredity, roughly, perhaps, 2/5 of that value; but there is considerable reason
2 to think that this reduction may take place owing to the presence of fictitious values
in the record arising from the peculiar circumstances under which thoroughbred
horses are reared and bred. These fictitious values would hardly influence the
means and variability of arrays like they must do the relationship between pairs of
individuals. Hence, when we deal with such means and variabilities as in the cases
on pp. 309 and 313, we find a much closer approach to the law of ancestral heredity.
Fecundity is certainly inherited ; that it is inherited according to the Galtonian law

* As a matter of fact, this conclusion is stronger than it appears here, for the correlation between
nieces and aunts was worked out, without grouping, for fourteen distinct series, and in thirteen of them
was found to be sensibly positive; in the fourteenth it was found to have an insignificant negative
value.
