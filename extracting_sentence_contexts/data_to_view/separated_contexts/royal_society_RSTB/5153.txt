The stomatal indices for the different parts of the leaf do, however, show a
uniformly higher value for the middle region as compared with those for the basal and
the apical regions, and, inasmuch as the leaves of Scilla grown in moist air in the dark
exhibit an increase of stomatal frequency in the middle region (cf. fig. 8) this increase
is probably due to internal factors. The conclusive proof that the variation in stomatal frequency in Scilla is mainly
the outcome of variations in growth of the epidermal cells is afforded by the fact that
there is no significant correlation between the stomatal indices and the stomatal
frequencies. The correlation coefficient for these two variables is only 0-147, which is
barely twice the standard error 0-0768. This absence of significant correlation is also
shown graphically in fig.
