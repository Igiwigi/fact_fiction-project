breccias and Rubble-drift.

With these many points of resemblance there is, I consider, good reason to believe
that in both countries these drifts are due to a common cause—one that we have
already seen equally affected the intermediate area. These drift beds require, how-
ever, further investigation, and may prove as rich in Paleolithic remains as the ground
above them has proved to be in prehistoric remains.

Crete.—From M. Victor Ravuin’s work on Crete* I gather that there is evidence
of the elevation of the island within the historical period to the extent of 15 to 25 feet,
and further, that at a height of about 65 feet, a Raised Beach of Quaternary age is met
with at many points of the coast. In the absence of sections and exact details, we
can only surmise that the Rubble-drift is present there from the mention of two facts—
(1) that at one place the Raised Beach is overlaid by a calcareous breccia (bréche cal-
caire) or “ Head ;” and (2) that at the foot of the great escarpments of the interior there
are immense accumulations of angular detritus. Some of these (terrains détritiques)
are recent, but some seem more widespread and older. They are traceable up to
heights of 200 to 300 metres. A red earth, as in Greece, covers much of the surface.

Admiral Sprarr has shown,t that within recent times there has been a subsidence

of the east coast of Crete, whilst the west side has been elevated to the extent of
26 feet. Anchor blocks have been found 11 feet above the sea level, and the port of
Kissamo has been raised 18 feet out of the sea within Christian times. The two
