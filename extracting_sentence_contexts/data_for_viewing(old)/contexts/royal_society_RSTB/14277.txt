Importantly, these differences are not expected to introduce suitable habitat recalls the competition colonization trade-off, | 5 |
much bias in the putative functions of the candidate genes classically known in ecology to facilitate the coexistence of

same trade-off also maintains variation at a supergene

4. Evolutionary dyn amics The social morphs have partially non-overlapping
geographical ranges in P. californicus, and completely non-
overlapping geographical ranges in L. acervorum [57,102-105].
While it remains unknown whether the social morphs are locally
adapted to their geographical ranges (in which case selection
could vary at a broad spatial scale), the fact that the two social
morphs are not in direct competition makes their evolutionary
maintenance easier to explain.

In ants, the ancestral state is monogyny [91]. Polygyny has
evolved secondarily in many lineages [92], but reverse tran-
sitions seem to be rare. In line with this, in the two species
(S. invicta, F. selysi) where there is genetic data for closely
related species, the polygyne-associated haplotype is derived.
The same is likely true for P. californicus, which has monogy-
nous sister species [36], and for C. niger because its polygyne-

associated haplotype is recessively lethal, and recessive . . =
