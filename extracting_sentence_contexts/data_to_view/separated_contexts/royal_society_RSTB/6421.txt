Resting spores have been described by Meunier (1913). In the cultures they were
mostly found in spring, lying singly within normal, not specially formed mother cells
(fig. 21, Plate 4). Apart from the fact that resting spores of Chaetoceros didymus were
also found in dense cultures only, the environmental conditions for their formation
must be somewhat different from those in Ditylum. They were never found in such
great numbers as in Ditylum—this applies also to all other diatoms which I cultured—
and were not regularly formed in successive subcultures throughout a long period. The first auxospores were noticed on 29 October in a 25 days old culture of the line
mentioned above.
