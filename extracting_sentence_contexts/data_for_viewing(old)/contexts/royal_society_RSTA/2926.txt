an individual's personal data from a dataset.!® Although these privacy concepts have not yet been

defined precisely and formally from a mathematical perspective, they aim to describe what the

goal of a privacy-preserving mechanism should be, rather than prescribing a specific family of
techniques.

(d) Bridging legal and other normative perspectives

It is also important to acknowledge that the normative concepts embedded within privacy
regulations may not be a perfect mirror of more fundamental normative concepts of privacy.
For instance, the choices made in the design of privacy regulations may reflect expedient political
or practical compromises, rather than actual individual and societal expectations. It may in fact
not be possible to close the gap between legal and other more fundamental normative concepts.
However, by learning how to analyse whether a technology satisfies a legal definition, it may also
be possible to develop analogous approaches for analysing whether a technology satisfies other
normative expectations of privacy, including those that serve as the motivation for regulatory
standards for privacy protection.
