extending along the posterior two-thirds of the figure, sometimes as a well-marked
concealed ridge; sometimes it is altogether absent. It is continuous backwards with
the lowest occipital convolutions.

A The lower internal connecting convolution (Plate XII. fig. 17, +) is feebly represented
© in both idiots, being, as usual, concealed in the idiot woman, but superficial in the idiot
E boy; the upper one is absent, as usual, in both idiots.

Z In the preceding account of the cerebral convolutions in the idiots' brains, constant
E comparisons have been made between them and the perfect brain, between the brains
= Þ of the one and the other idiot, and between both and the brains of the higher Apes.
& Notwithstanding, it is necessary to 8tate 8ome further general conclusions from the
= facts above recorded.

2 1. In the first place it is obvious that the idiots' cerebra are not merely diminutive
> brains possessing every conyolution, both primary and secondary, proper to the perfect
Z human cerebrum, each having its natural shape, proportion and position, though on a
= diminished scale; but, on the contrary, that they are profoundly modified in their con-
2 volutional forms, which are not merely s8maller in bulk, but are fewer in number, of
z 8impler shape, and different in proportion and position, as compared with those of the
<= perfect cerebrum.

S 2, Nevertheless all the primary and connecting convolutions belonging to the perfect
D cerebrum are represented by definite corresponding parts in these brains, mostly by
X actual convolutional foldings of the cerebral substance of a comparatively more simple
