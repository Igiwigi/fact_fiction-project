where G(x, t) = — 3 4x8(x, t). On this basis, the following representation can be derived as in [47,48]

&[6] =[ex (Jue —v)-utvu-G:uu}dx — Atul) B[v]D[vyP[ul, (4.3)

where A[u] denotes an unknown functional to account for possible breakdown of classical
solutions and J = det(5it/du).

In fact, we can confirm that J =1 as in the 3D incompressible case. We also have A[u] =0
because the Burgers equation is globally well-posed. Hence we find

P[o]= ] exp Gita —v)-utv-G:uu} dr) [v]D[v]P[w]. (4.4)

This formula connects the characteristic functional 6[v] of the heat equation with that of the
Burgers equation ®[@]. If we discard the second term of the exponent, it is clear that we recover
[6] = F[v] by the property of the Dirac measure (3.3). This form of path integral is valid only for
a viscous fluid, in contrast to the previous one which can cover an inviscid fluid as well. It is of
interest to study whether and how the above expression is simplified further when we make use
of the Cole-Hopf transform which linearizes the Burgers equation.
