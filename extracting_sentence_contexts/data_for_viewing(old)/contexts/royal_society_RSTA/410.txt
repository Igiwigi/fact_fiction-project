(i) Volume

Figure 1, a(iii) shows the Northern Hemisphere sea ice volume and area of the two stochastic
simulations and the reference simulation REF for March and September. Evidently, ECHAM6-
FESOM simulates substantial Arctic sea ice variability throughout the year across a wide range
of timescales. This appears to be rather consistent with observations and is discussed in more
detail in Sidorenko et al. [34] and especially by Rackow et al. [42]. The Arctic sea ice volume in
the uncoupled set-up STOCH_UNCPL is highly correlated to that of REF owing to the fact that
the sea ice has experienced effectively the same atmospheric forcing. However, STOCH_UNCPL
shows a clear increase in Arctic sea ice volume when compared to REF (figure 1, (i)). The first 20-—
30 years can be seen as a transient phase during which Arctic sea ice volume builds up slowly. It is
worth pointing out that the year-to-year increase in the sea ice volume is rather small during the
transient phase; the fact that the quasi-equilibrium response in the Arctic owing to the stochastic
sea ice scheme amounts to 10-20% after the first three decades of the integration can be explained
through accumulation.
