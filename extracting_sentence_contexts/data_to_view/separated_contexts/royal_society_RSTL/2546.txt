But the most remarkable spot where these Baltic shells
occur in a fossl state is still further to the south, at S5dertehe (see the Map, Plate I.),
about sixteen miles south-west of Stockholm, where they are found eleyated more than
ninety feet above the sea. At Sidertelje a canal was cut in 1819 across a barrier
of sand, gravel, and clay, which separated Lake Maeler from a long narrow inlet or
frith of the Baltic. The canal is, in fact, carried through the bottom of one of those
valleys 80 common in this district, of which the zides consist of rocks of gneiss, and
the bottom of the same covered by more recent deposits. The accompanying trans-
verse section (fig. 3.) will explain this geological structure. Fig. 3.
