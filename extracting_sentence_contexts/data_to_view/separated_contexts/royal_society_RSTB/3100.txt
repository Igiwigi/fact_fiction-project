Their final secondary position, as in fig. 30, might thus be taken for
their primary position if it were not for the information furnished by earlier stages. In the Trochophore larva, I believe, much the same series of changes takes place, only
in their secondary position these cells come to lie actually in the wall of the gut
at the point of its junction with the ectoderm. They are derived from the lips
of the closing blastopore at a point where, as a matter of fact, it is hard to decide
whether they are ecto- or endodermic. Mryrr has found, in Annelids, that the
mesoderm bands in some forms lie close in relation with the endoderm or gut, while
in others they lie close against the ectodermic wall. Whether this difference of
position of the pole cells in Polygordius and Eupomatus accounts for this arrange-
ment, I cannot say.
