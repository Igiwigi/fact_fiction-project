The table shows, that whilst the lake district stations generally
have received more rain than in 1845, the deposit in the five wettest localities is
somewhat less than in the previous year.

1847.—A glance at the first table will show that during the year 1847 much less
than an average quantity of rain has fallen* ; indeed, had it not been for the enormous
downfall in October, November and December, the past year would have been one
of the driest on record in this part of the country. At the close of September the
fall in the lake districts was from one-third to one-fourth less than the average of the
two preceding years : thus, Seathwaite was 29'59 inches, or nearly one-third ; Wast-
dale 18:76 inches, or one-fourth ; and Gatesgarth 34-96 inches, or more than one-third
$hort of the average of 1845 and 1846, for the same period. But the year 1847 is
memorable for the remarkable fact, that as much or nearly as much rain fell in the
last three months as descended during the other nine months of the year. At the
following stations, the quantity from October to December inclusive is considerably
more than one-half of the whole annual depth. January to October.
