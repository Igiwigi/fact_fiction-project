Where my laboratory is
$ituated, in South Kensington, the E.N.E., E., and §.E. are quarters in which the
dpnsest parts of commercial London are sehaaa: and consequently, if a wind from
‘ny of these quarters prevails, the observations are liable to be marred by smoke ; but
) the N.N.E., N., N.W., W., and S. there is a comparative freedom from any such
urce of error; and with a wind blowing from those quarters the sky can be as
‘Blue as it is in the most uninhabited part of the country. This is important to
mark, since it may be thought that the neighbourhood of a big city like London is
an unsuitable one for making sunlight observations. In fact, a comparison of results
Sbtained at South Kensington with those obtained in what is termed pure country
Sir, shows that the latter has no perceptible advantage over the former when the
gvind is in a suitable quarter.
& In September, 1886, I took my apparatus to Switzerland, eventually bringing it to
Say old observing station on the Riffel, Zermatt, at the height of about 8,000 feet.
n three different days I made observations under the most favourable circumstances,
hich will be described later on. In England my observations were usually made at
About either 10, 12, 2, or 5 o’clock ; sometimes more than one set was taken on each
day. I thought it inadvisable that anyone except myself should take readings, in
order to avoid any readings which might be difficult of collation.
