rangement and progress of the aurora. I had shown that its arrangement and pro-
gress are definite in relation to the lines of magnetism of the earth, in a paper pub-
lished in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal in April, 1823*, and afterwards in
the letter addressed to the President of the Royal Society, and published in the
Philosophical Transactions, 1829, above referred to. In the latter publication, after
describing various appearances of the aurora, I stated that these appearances indicated
the following necessary results :—

* 1st. That the aurora borealis always presents itself in definite and very curious
relations to the lines of magnetism indicated by the needle.

* 2nd. That the streamers, in the direction of their length, coincide with the plane
of the dip of the needle, or nearly 80; and that each individual streamer is, in fact,
parallel to the dipping-needle.

*©3rd. That they [the streamers] form a thin fringe, stretching often a great way
from east to west at right angles to the magnetic meridian.

*4th. That the fringe moves away from the north magnetic pole, by the extinction
of streamers at its northern face, and the formation of new ones, contiguous to its
southern face. L

*5th. That the invariable regularity of its appearance, as seen by many observers,
when it comes fully within command of the eye near the zenith, shows the apparent
