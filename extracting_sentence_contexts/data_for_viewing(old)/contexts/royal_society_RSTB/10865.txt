[16]. Whether its overexpression reflects the role of INO80 in
the survival of replication stress or in gene expression is unclear,
yet the downregulation of INO80 impaired melanoma cancer
cell growth and tumorigenesis [104]. Interestingly, INO80
occupies and activates the super-enhancers (SEs) of certain
oncogenes, apparently by increasing chromatin accessibility
and promoting recruitment of Mediator to these sites [104].
Given the similarities between promoters and enhancers
[106], it is expected that INO80 represses the production of
bidirectional non-coding RNAs at enhancers (eRNAs) and
SEs [107], particularly given the increase in aberrant IncRNAs
found in cancer cell lines [108]. In the context of cancer
development, the fact that INO80 controls the level
of spurious transcription (figure 1a) may impact non-coding
RNAs. Consistently, the knockdown of INO80 attenuated
stem-cell-specific properties of the aforementioned cancer
cells, including their ability to form tumours [16,105]. This
suggests that the role of INO80 in cancer cells is linked to its
stem-cell-promoting function.

Finally, besides cancer, INO80 the proteasome and the
RNAPII machinery have all been associated with progression
of Alzheimerâ€™s disease [109], raising the possibility that degra-
dation of RNAPII by INO80 [2] is involved in neuronal cell
functions. The multiplicity of roles in chromatin dynamics
