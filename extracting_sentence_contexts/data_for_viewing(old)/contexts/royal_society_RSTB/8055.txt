a character can be defined the more objective the measurements of it are likely to be.
In this sense the measurements of, say, the length of the test of an echinoid are less
objective than the measurements of the length of the metal rod, since in the first case it

is more difficult the define the exact limits between which the measurements are being
made.

If the secular error forms too large a part of the total observational error, there is
always a danger that the means of comparable measurements on two samples may differ
significantly, although this difference, in fact, is due mainly to the slowly fluctuating
idiosyncrasies of the observer. If, however, the effect of the latter is swamped by the
random accidental errors, spurious differences of this sort, due simply to the slowly
fluctuating secular error, will not be liable to occur. The measurements can then be said
to be reproducible.

Accuracy is equally important, however, which means that the total error, from all
sources, must be small. In reproducible measurements much the greater part of the total
error is contributed by the accidental errors. â€˜These accidental errors, which are usually
to all intents and purposes normally distributed, produce no systematic bias in the means
of sets of observations. What does happen is that these random errors increase, on the
average, the scatter of the observations about their mean. Due to this increased scatter
the estimates of the variance of such sets of observations will be systematically too
