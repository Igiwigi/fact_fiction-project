These the
aline cells eliminate from the body in which they dwell by dissolving them.
a2.) The ingestion of particles which they cannot digest, such as Indian ink, or
particles. These they do not eliminate from the body, but carry them to the
onnective tissues and there hide them away. Instances of this are found in the
emoval of dust particles by the phagocytes of the lung, and in the fate of Indian ink
when injected into the body of Dytiscus, as shown by Durnam.*

aa would appear, from the facts so far set forth, that the fate of the microbe in the
’s lymph depends upon the activity of two kinds of cellular elements. Are we
attribute, therefore, no part in the conflict to the non-ameeboid cells which are

eRarged with rose-staining granules? This question is at once answered by the fact

a. of the conditions apparently necessary to a successful issue to the conflict

een the eosinophile cells and the micro-organisms, whether the conflict occur in
body or out of the body, is an increase in the number, and still more in the size
granulation of these cells.
