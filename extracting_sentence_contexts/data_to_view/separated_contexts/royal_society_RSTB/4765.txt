That such soil heterogeneity exists in this field may be shown by
a comparison of 2a with the adjacent plot 2b. These have received the same manure
since 1885, but during the present century 2a has ceased to gain in yield upon 2b, but yields
very regularly on the average 2 bushels less than the adjacent plot. In view of this
fact we cannot deny the possibility that with equal manuring the land of plots 17 and 18
would yield 2 or more bushels less than that of plot 5, and that this circumstance has
served to mask the advantage accruing to the mineral series owing to residual nitrogen. Tt may be mentioned in addition that the mean yield of 17 and 18 ammonium series is
2-36 less than that of plot 7, a difference which may be ascribed to the combined effect

of soil inferiority and lack of residual nitrogen ; it should be borne in mind that a differ-
ence of this amount in a yield of 30 bushels probably would require the addition of con-
siderably more nitrogen than an equal increase in a yield of 14 bushels. Type III.â€”Plot 7, complete minerals, with double dressing of ammonium salts, of
which one quarter is applied in autumn.
