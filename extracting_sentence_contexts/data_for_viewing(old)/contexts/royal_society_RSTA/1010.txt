out of the gap, while in cylindrical Couette geometry, particles are pushed outside the free surface
and air enters the suspension, producing a foam at the surface. To get rid of a free interface and
also to have a high enough torque capacity, we have used a high-torque viscosimeter developed
by the CAD company, mainly to measure the viscosity of concrete. We have designed a cell where
the suspension is confined by a Teflon seal (figure 3). To prevent slipping, we have used either a
vane or a double helix as the rotating tool; also the outside wall is serrated with stripes of depth
0.2mm.

This rheometer works in the imposed velocity mode and, in figure 3b, we have reported the
stress measured during a ramp of shear rate. We see that there is an abrupt jump of stress which
reaches 80 kPa; nevertheless, this stress does not remain at this high level but oscillates between
the flowing and jamming state and its amplitude increases with the shear rate. In this case, the
structure of the suspension manages to come back transiently to the flowing state, despite the fact
that the shear rate is above the critical one. We shall discuss this point in the section (ยง3) devoted
to the application of a magnetic field.

(b) Rheological model of the jamming transition

It is now quite well established that the DST is generated by the transition from lubricated to
frictional contacts as shown by numerical simulations [20]. The key parameter is the fraction of
