In this way, one has the meridian passage through
the middle of the field, or within 2' of it: and the meridian
altitude of both the limbs, while the sun's centre is on the
meridian ; for the little alteration in altitude is s0on done, and
can disturb nothing. Indeed, upon the whole, this instrument itself is capable of
doing a great deal of good work; and convinces me fully, that
one between piers would be highly advantageous to astro-
nomy. As a transit, mine is perfect, s far as that size per-
mits: indeed it is in fact to all intents a transit-instrument. And for altitudes; since the readings are totally independent
of the circle, though you have it in your power to re-examine
your microscopes by the plumb-line between each observa-
tion, if you please; you find there is no occasion for it: In that
respect, it has the advantage over a quadrant. No force is
used in setting this instrument : the whole, from its form,
is counterpoised in itself: there is no more probability of de-
ranging it in altitude, than in azimuth : and therefore, all
you have to do in actual observation beyond a common
transit-instrument, is, to bisect the star as it passes, or as
S00N as ever it has passed the meridian wire, and read off
the microscopes afterwards.
