this process, Girardia dorotocephala, only requires a fragment of
about 0.08 mm’, the equivalent of approximately 10 000 cells,
to achieve complete body regeneration [18-20]. As if this fact
was not remarkable enough, the regeneration capabilities of
some planarian species include the complete and correct recon-
stitution of their nervous tissue, including their brain [21-24].
It is difficult to overstate the potential relevance of these organ-
isms’ regenerative abilities for the possible development of
medical treatments for neurological diseases and injures. Inter-
estingly, there is also mounting evidence that decapitated
planarians that regenerate their heads partially retain some
learned habits or training acquired prior to the decapitation
event, a fact that is particularly relevant to the exploration of
where memories are stored in an organism [25-27].

In the process of developing their ideas about the brain,
Sarnat and Netsky proposed as a working hypothesis that the
planarian brain could be seen as a precursor of the human
brain. In other words, they essentially proposed that the planar-
ian brain was the first evolutionary example of a vertebrate-
style brain. They were very careful to explicitly state that
there was no evidence that planarians were ina direct line lead-
ing to vertebrates, and rightly so, since today we know that they
actually are not. Nonetheless, the planarian and vertebrate
brains at the very least represent a curious example of conver-
