These studies were later extended to other organisms, including Neurospora and mammals, |
in which similar molecular mechanisms based on transcriptional regulation and protein :3

modification were uncovered [153-155]. If the circadian mechanism in these cells still relies on
negative autoregulation of gene expression, the nature of the dozen clock genes involved may
differ, as well as the effect of light. Thus, in mammals, light acts by inducing gene expression, in
contrast with the situation observed in Drosophila. The physiological importance of the circadian
clock is reflected by the fact that it controls key functions such as the sleep-wake cycle [156] as
well as the periodic expression of a majority of genes in mammals [157,158].

From a theoretical point of view, models for the circadian clock in Drosophila, Neurospora
and mammals show that negative autoregulation of transcription can give rise to circadian
oscillations of the limit cycle type in a domain in parameter space bounded by critical values of
control parameters [159-162], as illustrated in figure 3. Circadian clocks thus represent temporal
dissipative structures, which originate at the cellular level from regulatory feedback loops
that destabilize a non-equilibrium steady state. In mammals, circadian rhythms synchronize
among cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is the circadian pacemaker located in the
hypothalamus [163]. In agreement with this observation, models show that coupled circadian
oscillators do spontaneously synchronize [164,165].
