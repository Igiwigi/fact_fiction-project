Â® It may be well here to emphasize the fact that the elements of the entire ganglion
9 are placed in the most intimate connection by means of the complex central plexus. $ No conception of this primitive nervous system will be an adequate one which does
& not realize the fact that it is throughout a cell and fibre plexus condensed along
&. certain lines. Even the well-marked bundle of fibres passing from the commissure
= direct to the anterior nerve is, in its course through the ganglionic plexus, intimately
6 related to, and obviously a part of, that structure, being connected with it by
% filaments.
