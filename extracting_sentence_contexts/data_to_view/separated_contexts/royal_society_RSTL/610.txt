From the results of these experiments we may safely con-
clude, that if the hot body, instead of being a conical vessel
covered up on all sides except its flat bottom, had been a globe,
and if this hot globe had been suspended in the centre of another
larger thin hollow sphere, (this last being, at the beginning of
the experiment, at the same temperature as the air and walls of
the room,) the vicinity of the surface of this hollow globe, to the
surface of the hot body, would have retarded the cooling of the
hot body, in the same manner as the cooling of the conical
vessel No. 5 was retarded in the foregoing experiments; and if,
instead of inclosing the hot body in the centre of a single hollow
sphere, of any given thickness, it were placed in the common
centre of a number of much thinner concentric spheres, of dif-
ferent diameters, the time of cooling would be still more retarded. By tracing the various operations which would take place-in
the cooling of the hot body, in this imaginary experiment, we
Shall become acquainted with the nature of those which actually
take place, when the cooling of a hot body is prolonged by
means of warm clothing. From the results of several of the foregoing experiments we
may conclude, that, supposing the thin concentric hollow spheres
in which the hot body is confined to be made of metal, the
cooling will be slower, if the surfaces of these spheres are po-
lished, than if they are unpolished, or blackened : and hence we
might very naturally be led to suspect, (what is probably true
in fact,) that the warmth of any kind of substance used as

clothing, or its power of preventing our bodies from being
cooled by the influence (frigorific radiations) of surrounding
colder bodies, depends very much 01 the polzisb of its surface. If, with the assistance of a microscope, we examine those
substances which supply us with the warmest coverings, such
for instance as furs, feathers, silk, &c. we shall find their sur-
faces not only smooth, but also very: highly polished ; we hall
also find that, other circumstances being equal, those substances
are the warmest which are the finest, or which are composed
of the greatest number of fine polished detached threads or
fibres. yew 7

The fine white shining fur of a Russian hare, is much warmer
than coarse hair; and fine silk, as- spun by the silk-worm, is
warmer than the same silk twisted together into coarse threads ;
as I found by actual experiments, an account of which has
already been laid before this Society, and published in the Phi-
losophical Transactions. I formerly considered the warmthr of natural and artificial
clothing, as depending principally on the obstacle it opposes to
the motions of the cold air by which the hot body is surrounded ;
but, by a patient and careful examination of the subject, I have
been convinced, that the efficacy of radiation is much greater than
I had supposed it to be.
