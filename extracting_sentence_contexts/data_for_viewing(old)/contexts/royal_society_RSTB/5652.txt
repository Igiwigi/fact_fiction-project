equivalent to 11 molecules ofa monobasic acid. This is distributed as follows :â€”

(a) 7 molecules as hydriodie acid equivalent to the 7 molecules of alkaline iodide
estimated (see p. 148).

(b) 1 molecule as formic acid (see p. 144).

(c) 2 molecules as one molecule of oxalic acid (see p. 145).

(d) 1 molecule as glycollic acid (see p. 146).

Hence it is clear that no other acid is formed during the reaction, and this is
supported by the fact that, although carbon dioxide was tested for among the reaction
products, its presence could not be demonstrated.

It is now possible, from a consideration of the results obtained, to construct an equation
for the reaction. The results may be briefly summarized. It has been proved that
one molecule of kojic acid in alkaline solution takes up 10 atoms of iodine (p. 140), and
gives rise to one molecule of iodoform and 7 molecules of iodide (p. 143), one
molecule of formic acid (p. 144), one molecule of oxalic acid (p. 145), one molecule of
glycollic acid (p. 146), and a total acidity equivalent to 11 molecules of monobasic acid
(p. 146).

Thus the equation for the action of iodine on kojic acid in alkaline solution is
