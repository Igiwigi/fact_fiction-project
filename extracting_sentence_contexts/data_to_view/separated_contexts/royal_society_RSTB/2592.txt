This observation goes far to confirm some of my arguments in the
preceding chapter. The “precocity” of the change from bilateral to radial sym-
metry in the Palwozoie Cyathophylloids finds expression in the rich variety of form
attained by their descendants as early as Triassic time. On the other hand, the
tardiness of the change in the Zaphrentoids is consistent with the fact that the
Turbinolide had not attained a steady type even in Jurassic time, and their full
development was postponed until the Middle-Cretaceous age and its favourable
oceanic conditions. The general resemblance between the recent representatives of Astraide and
Amphiastraide (of diagram, p. 331) which caused them to be placed in one family
(Astreidz), becomes all the more readily understood when the near relationship
of their early ancestors is held in view. I have already referred to Professor
Nicuotson’s indications of genera intermediate between the three sub-divisions which
he made (‘ Manual,’ p. 284) of Paleozoic Madreporaria : Cyathophylloidea, Zaphren-
toidea, Cystiphylloidea.
