to produce the effects found, but it is possible that the explanation may lie in the fact
that, as pointed out by Russe (1928, 1930), species of the plankton, which normally
occur at depths below 10-15 m. during April, May, and June, become abundant, as
shown by the percentage depth distribution curves, right up to the surface in July,
August, and possibly September also, In Calanus finmarchicus it was found that the
females of the summer brood were always slightly higher up in the water than the males.
The presence of vitamin D in zooplankton has been demonstrated by BrLtoc, Fasre,
and Srmonert (1930), also by DrummMonp and GuNTHER (1930).

It also seems possible that, though anti-rachitic action is but feeble at wave-lengths
longer than 313 my, yet owing to their better penetration those somewhat longer than
the limit given may be more effective in sea water.
