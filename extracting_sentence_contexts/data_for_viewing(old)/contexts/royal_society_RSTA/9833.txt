scope for adjustment of values by a proper choice of say a and y in (ad) X (yÃ©), and
specially so in y when m > 2, such cases cannot be considered as established unless 4 is
very large, or the A enter only, or unless there is independent evidence by the existence
of intermediate steps.

When these collaterals were first found it was noticed that in general a positive
displacement seemed in the majority of cases to increase the intensity of the lines, and
a negative to decrease it. This is clear when the displacements considered are those
from the Ist to the 2nd set of a doublet series where the displacement is a negative
one and there is always a decrease in intensity. It is also evident in the satellites of
the D series. Apparently, as will be shown, the typical line of the series is the
satellite. The strong line is a positive collateral of this and always shows a great
increase of intensity. Although these facts are obvious the connection was not
recognised, until the relation showed itself first in a series of collaterals. It is, I think,
safe to say that a positive displacement produces a tendency to increase of intensity ;
there may be other causes acting so as sometimes to mask the effect, but in general,
where the rule appears to be broken, the suggested displacements should be regarded
with some doubt. In so far as I have used this rule in the following, the results are
biassed and of course the evidence for the rule to that extent weakened.

It would be possible to give here long lists of collaterals. As, however, the present
communication has reference chiefly to the discovery of general laws as a necessary
preliminary to the more thorough examination of special spectra, it will be sufficient
to refer for evidence to the cases which arise in the succeeding discussion. This seems,
however, a natural place to refer to certain cases discussed in Parts I. and II., where
