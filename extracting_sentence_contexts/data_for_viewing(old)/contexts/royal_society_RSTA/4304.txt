stationary signals; that is, it does not require any a priori assumptions about the signal itself and nee)
its convergence has been proved when applied to one-dimensional signals.

Post-processing method (PostP). Given the classification matrix C ¢ R'*", produced by a ty
given classifier, we decompose C using the MIF method into its first IMF I; and a 3
remainder/trend R. We then remove the first IMF from C producing the new classification :2
C=C-—h=R. We represent this method using the operator PostP: RIX +> RI, .
C+ C=PostP(C).

We observe that, since the convergence of this method applied to the decomposition of two-
dimensional signals is still an open problem, we checked the meaningfulness of the outcome of
such a post-processing using the one-dimensional convergent MIF method. We consider, in fact,
the classification scores first along each row and then along each column of the classification
matrix, and vice versa. The results of these two procedures prove to be close to that obtained
by post-processing directly the two-dimensional classification using the two-dimensional MIF
method.

The other method we present here is a pre-processing technique. The goal is to devise a
completely data-driven decorrelation and mean-centring technique that can be applied to a
hyperspectral dataset before classifying it with the plain COS measure. The idea behind this pre-
processing method comes from the observations we made previously regarding the ACE and COS
classifiers. In particular, we know that ACE requires a priori knowledge of the mean signature
and covariance matrix of the background, and we observed that if we can somehow whiten
and mean-centre the hyperspectral image pixel signatures then the COS and ACE classifiers
