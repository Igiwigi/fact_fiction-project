beyond all possibility of doubt.*

Instead of inquiring after the nature of the cause of the
condensation of nebulous matter, it would indeed be sufficient
for the present purpose to call it merely a- condensing prin--
ciple ; but since we are already acquainted with the centripetal
force of attraction which gives a globular figure to planets,
keeps them from flying out of their orbits in tangents, and;
makes one star revolve around another, why should we: not
look up to-the universal gravitation of matter as the cause of.
every condensation, accumulation, compression, and concen--
tration of the nebulous matter? Facts are not wanting to
prove that such a, power has been exerted; and as I shall
point out a. series of phenomena in the heavens where astro-
nomers. may read in legible characters the manifest vestiges
of such an exertion, I need not hesitate to- proceed in a few.
additional remarks on the consequences that mnust arise from
the admission of this attractive principle.

The nebula, for instance, which has been described at the
beginning of this article, as containing several bright nuclei,
has probably 80 many predominant seats of attraction, arising
