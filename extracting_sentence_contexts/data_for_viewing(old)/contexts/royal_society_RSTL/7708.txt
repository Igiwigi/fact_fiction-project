of 7 3; there is a like correspondence in the length of the symphysis mandibule.

The age of the animal whose remains have been obtained from sedimentary fresh-
water deposits, and the age of the animal from the Cavern, indicate the different cir-
cumstances under which they have respectively died—the one probably from old age,
the other by the hand of man.


548 PROFESSOR OWEN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE CAVERN OP

Neither the text (pp. 155, 156) nor the figures (plate iii. Pachydermes) relative to
the remains of Equines, in the © Recherches sur les Os8emens Fossiles du Puy-de-Dome,”
by CRorzer and JoBERT, 4to, 1828, allow of further deductions beyond the fact that they
relate to a species of the size of Zquus spelus, and, like it, more resembling the Horse
than the Ass#.

In the collection of Equine fossils from freshwater beds at the © Tour de Juvillac”
(alluvion sup6rieur of BravarD's MS. Catal.) are two 8eries of grinders, each from the
left side of the upper jaw, one agreeing in size with those of var. A of Equus spelwus,
the other with those of var. B. But the smaller series has the last molar, m 3, less
bilobed behind than in yar. A (Plate LX. fig. 2, m 3); it more resembles that in var. B
(fig. 3, m3). The series of the smaller grinders of the Puy-de-Dome Equine are in a
less straight line than in Plate LX. fig. 2, their curve agreeing with that of var. B, Plate
LX. fig. 3. For the rest, the correspondence of the series of molars from the Auvergne
beds (No. 34657 of Register, Brit. Mus.) with that of the Cave-Equine (Plate L'X. fig. 2)
