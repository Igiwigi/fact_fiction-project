in precisely two ways as an ir rational function of its co-axial minors,

minant of uneven order is so expressible at all. Of order superior to 3, it is not possible to assume arbitrary values for the deter-

minant itself and all of its co-axial minors. In fact of order m the values assumed

must satisfy
2°—n+n—2

conditions, but, these conditions being satisfied, the determinant can be constructed
so as to involve 7 — 1 undetermined quantities.

$1. Arr. 1. In a Memoir on “The Theory of the Composition of Numbers,” recently
communicated to the Royal Society (as above-mentioned), there occurred certain
generating functions which admitted important transformations to redundant forms.
