Water charged with
silt probably found its way into the cave by the lower or north entrance and deposited
the cave-earth, in which occurs s0 great an accumulation of bones, including, in addition
to the above-named animals, those of the various Deer, Bears, Fox, Rhinoceros, Hare,
and Lemming. Looking at all the circumstances of the case, T consider it most pro-
bable that at that second period the caye was at times dry, and at other times flooded,
not, by streams flowing in from higher ground, but by flood-waters from streams at a
level lower than that of the caye—that during the former intervals the cave continued
to be frequented by Carnivores who brought in their prey to devour—and that with
each successive inundation successive collections of bones were covered up and imbedded

in the sediment with which the flood-waters were charged. There are two facts frequently noticed by Mr. Busx and apparently irreconcilable, but
which are in perfect accordance with this view of the subject. The one is that many of
the 'bones, although found at some depth in the cave-earth No. 3, are yet lightly

bones show a condition which Mr.
