Mr. HuxLey $tates that in
a 80litary instance he observed a fibre pass a short distance into the dentine\.

Both M. K6uKtr and M, Lent regard the process which they observed extend-
ing from the peripheral cells of the pulp in forming teeth, as organisms for the deve-
lopment of the dentinal tubes. The latter author, near the conclusion of his article
on the development of dentine, states, the processes of the cells are the dentinal tubes. He observes further on, that the fact first observed by MuLLER and then by K6LLuKER,

explained by the history of the development ; the wall of the dentinal canal is iden-

communication, but shall confine myself to showing that the dentinal tubes are in the
