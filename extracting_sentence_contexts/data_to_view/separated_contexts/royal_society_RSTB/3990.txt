T. G. Lonesrarr,* who has had much personal experience of
climbing at high altitudes, lays great stress on the influence in preventing mountain
sickness of previous training in muscular work ; and the effect of such training would
presumably be to strengthen the power of the lung epithelium to react promptly and
powerfully to the stimulus of which we are presuming the existence, as well as to
increase the muscular efficiency. The fall in alveolar CO, pressure, and consequent rise in alyeolar oxygen pressure,
seems undoubtedly to be due to diminished alkalinity of the blood. The fact that
the alkalinity of the blood is diminished at high altitudes was first demonstrated by
Gaxeorrr,} though it was already known that lactic acid is produced in large amounts
in animals exposed to great want of oxygen. Boycorr and Hatpanet{ furnished
indirect evidence that the fall in alveolar CO, pressures at low atmospheric pressure
is due to the presence in the blood of lactic acid or other acid substances which have
the same influence as CO, on the respiratory centre, so that less CO, is required to
excite it. Lactic acid is also known to be produced by excessive muscular exertion,
as a consequence, doubtless, of lack of oxygen in the active muscles.
