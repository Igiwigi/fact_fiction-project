Instead of asking which species are musical,
we ask how musicality works, its essential ingredients,
which ingredients are shared with other species, and how
these evolved. In essence, we are combining functional, developmental,
phylogenetic and mechanistic approaches [26] to generate a
theory of musicality while focusing on the constituent capacities
underlying the musicality phenotype. In fact, we propose to
address Tinbergen’s [26] four questions by first describing the
mechanisms, functions and developmental course of musicality
ina variety of animals and cultures, with input from anthropolo-
gical, neuroscientific and genetic sources. By doing so, we hope
to learn more about how music evolved. A multicomponent perspective, which involves studying the
constituents of musicality in the ‘here and now’ by means of a
comparative approach across cultures and species, is one
means of addressing the critique that the evolution of musi-
cality cannot be studied (§4).
