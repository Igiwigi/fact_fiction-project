No Quaternary diatoms were found in RISP sediments, implying little accumulation of
advected materials beneath the ice shelf at this site. However, coring may have failed to recover
the true sedimentâ€”water interface [45,48]. That is perhaps borne out by the fact that modern


diatoms were found living in seawater in crevasses at nearby Crary Ice Rise [49], which would
be expected to accumulate on the nearby sub-ice shelf sea floor. In 1987, a sediment sample
was recovered (by accident) during hot water drilling (HWD) at the Crary Ice Rise. This sample
contained a Miocene diatom assemblage that was slightly younger than the youngest age at RISP,
but also contained no Pliocene or Pleistocene diatoms [48].
