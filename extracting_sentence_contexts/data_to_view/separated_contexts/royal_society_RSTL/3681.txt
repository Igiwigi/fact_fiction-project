But we must now inquire particularly what it is we mean by the section of the elec-

trolyte, The limits of the section of the metallic conductor are strict and easily

* The rexistance of each liquid is specific, and depends upon the nature of the liquid, the degree of saturation

determined; but, taking into consideration the diffusive nature of the electrolytic
force, and the wide spread of that polarization of the particles of an electrolyte which
we have traced upon a former occasion to the back surface of a conducting plate
opposed to a mere point of generating metal*, it is more difficult to define the limits
of its action $0 as to satisfy the conditions of the formula. In a cell composed of a plate of generating metal with a conducting plate of equal
dimensions, the interposed electrolyte only wetting the opposite faces of the two
metals, the area of the section of the electrolyte will clearly be equal to the area of
the acting surface of the conducting plate. In case the two metals should be im-
mersed in a trongh, in such a manner as to allow of the electrolyte being in contact,
with both sides of the plates, it is also probable that the action of the back surfaces
might be disregarded without danger of material error in our calculations, although
we know in fact that they would not be wholly passive. Up to this point, there-
fore, there is no difficulty in the application of Oaum's formula. But how are we to determine the area of the section of the electrolyte, when the
surfaces of the generating and conducting plates are not equal ? as, for instance, in
the case of a rod of zinc placed within a cylinder of copper.
