These observations point to the
source of the oil in the distillation of the Chinese wax, viz. the transformation of the
ceroten itself into isomeric hydrocarbons. In fact, I found, if the ceroten be distilled
and redistilled in a closed tube of the form annexed, that by effecting =
the distillation in this manner under pressure, after about two distil- 0)
lations the distillate becomes liquid and the-solid matter entirely dis-
appears. The experiment after about six distillations was put an end to by the
bursting of the heated end of the tube, when a large quantity of combustible vapour
