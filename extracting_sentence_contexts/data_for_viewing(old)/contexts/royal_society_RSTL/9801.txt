no longer in a determinate direction ; the animal therefore advances slowly and in a
very uncertain manner, frequently changing its direction of advance, and manifesting
a marked tendency to rotate upon its own axis, either without moving from one spot,
or gyrating round and round some one or more centres in a wholly aimless way. The
animals, however, are still able to climb perpendicular surfaces, though in a most
uncertain manner. When stimulated strongly the activity of the animal is increased,
but its power of escaping from the source of injury is completely destroyed; it crawls
differently in any direction—as likely as not towards the source of injury—rotates
upon its axis, and after crawling some distance in one direction may very likely reverse
that direction, and 80 return to the place from which it started. All these movements,
standing in such marked contrast to those exhibited by unmutilated specimens under
similar circumstances, prove that the co-ordination of the ambulacral feet has been
destroyed. On the other hand, the fact that they continue able to act at all proves
that their activity is not wholly dependent upon the nerye-centre ; all that the des-
truction of this centre entails is the destruction of their power of co-ordinated action.

When perfectly fresh and vigorous specimens are inverted, a proportion of about
three to four remain permanently inverted till they die. As this is never the case
with perfectly fresh and vigorous specimens when unmutilated, there can be no
question that destruction of the nerve-centre exerts a profound influence on the action
of the ambulacral feet upon which the execution of the righting mancuvre depends.
On the other hand, the fact that a certain proportion of individuals continue able to
execute this manceuvre after destruction of the nerve-centre—although they never do
80 without much difficulty and great expenditure of time—proves that the integrity of
this centre is not absolutely essential to the execution of this manceuyre. Therefore,
