and oxygen might be very important.
Dave Rugg Xavier’s [Feaugas] talk gave a great insight into the hydrogen—-oxygen

interaction. One of the things that is really quite terrifying is if you
go back and read that huge Conrad paper [5], there is an underlying
strain rate sensitivity, which is something absolutely inherent. If you
normalize all hexagonal close-packed metals to quasi-static, they all fall
on the same gradient; Ramesh did a beautiful paper on that [6]. What
you find with the interstitials is that you get these huge variations in
the strain rate sensitivity around the —100 to +150°C range, which is
exactly the range where hydrogen has its effects as well.

You have the fact that your local stress states are changing, and one of
the areas I am really keen to have a go at is the nature of the interstitial
strength from oxygen at the fundamental level. I have been having a lot
of conversations with the Berkeley group about this, and they have been
doing some lovely work on it. Currently, there is a fair bit of work going
on including Imperial, Oxford and Berkeley, looking at aluminium. You
start looking at TisAl, and how oxygen interacts with that. I think the
next step will be to look at how hydrogen interacts with it. Personally, I
suspect it is probably in most titanium alloys as a second-order effect in
comparison with what the BCC phase is doing for you. That would be
my judgment, but I may well be wrong, so give it five years and I might
have changed my mind.
