Large portions of these beds have been re-
moved along the centre of the valley, yet it is quite eyident from the fringe or line of
terraces which skirt each side, that the bottom must originally have formed a smooth
concave surface inclined towards the mouth of the valley. Portions more or less
perfect of this same deposit can be followed up the course of the Roy, and up the
higher parts of the Spean, where the valley is not too rocky or narrow, to near Loch
Laggan. This loch is but little below the 972-feet shelf; and at present I wish, for
the sake of the independence of the argument derived from the facts to be stated, to
consider only that part of the country which is below the leyel of that shelf. These
irregularly stratified beds, near the mouth of the Spean, attain a thickness of several
hundred feet, and they consist of sand and pebbles, many of the latter being perfectly
waterworn. Higher up the valley, near the bridge of Roy, the thickness before the
central portions were remoyed appears to have been about sixty feet, but of course
the thickness varies according to the original irregularities of the rocky bottom of
the valley.
