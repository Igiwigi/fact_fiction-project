a e,, &c., we can combine every (1+e,,)-division of the (2+a,,)-gon in the interval with
every (1+e,)-division of the (2+a,)-gon, &c. ; that is, we can make C take

D(2+a,, e,).D(2+az, &).D(2+, 6g)... D(2+0-, Ga) = Onan

different forms, by mere variation of arrangement of diagonals, the same variation being
made about every agonal axis, and consequently the same variation occurring about every
diagonal axis. Of these As-»; configurations no two can be alike; for the intervals of

axes which limit them, because one is an agonal and the other a diagonal axis; s0 that,
in fact, no disturbance of one or more diagonals of N can produce N' a repetition of N.
Tf the limiting axes were alike, it might possibly occur that N' should be a reflexion of
N, the configuration of one read from right to left in the interval being that of the other
read from left to right.

It is to be observed here, and in all products that we may handle of the form of
EY that when «,,=0 and consequently e,=—1, D(2+,, e,,) is either to be omitted,

8ides between two adjoining axes are irreyersible configurations, if we look at the

or counted unity, 80 that AO is always =1.

XXVII. Next, let us make a variation in our solution of equation (A.), either by
