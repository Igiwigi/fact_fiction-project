—.—-— Duturbed Days xx Quiet Days onsen Differ Oe Curver

Presumably there is a gradual transition in the type of the inequality in V as we
pass from the quietest to the most disturbed of days. It will, in fact, be noticed in
Table VIIL. that the negative hourly values near 11 a.m. are numerically larger in
the inequalities derived from all the days than in those derived from the more highly
disturbed days, though earlier in the morning near the time of the minimum the
latter are much the larger. This doubtless represents the influence which on days
free from disturbance makes the minimum come at about 11 a.m.
