652 MR. J. LISTER ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. F

The buffy coat in inflammatory blood was first explained by Mr. WrarTox JoxnsÂ®,
who showed that it resulted from the red corpuscles aggregating more closely than usual,
and therefore falling more rapidly through the lighter plasma, s0 as to leave the upper
portions completely before the occurrence of coagulation. It was supposed by the ame
authority that this peculiarity of the red discs was due to increased fibrine in 0lution,
rendering the liquor sanguinis abnormally viscid, and 80 operating like the admixture
of gum above alluded to. But the fact that the corpuscles aggregate as closely after
the fibrine has been removed as before, appears quite opposed to such a view. I haye
examined many drops of my own blood, before and after the removal of its fibrine, with
the special object of ascertaining this point, and have never been able to detect any
material difference between the aggregation in the two ets of cases. In the blood of the
bat before mentioned, which was probably suffering constitutionally from inflammation,
the corpuscles continued to retain their excessive adhesiveness for a whole hour after
coagulation of the fibrine. I once made a similar observation on a specimen of horse's
blood F, which, as is well known, presents the buffy coat in the state of health. Having
divided the clot vertically several hours after coagulation had occurred, my attention
was attracted, on looking at the section, by minute red points, like grains of and,
lying in the lower part of the buff, just above the coloured portion of the coagulum,
On microscopic examination of a small piece containing some of them, they proved, as
