G. SYKES ON THE ANATOMY AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE

There are points of striking similarity between the ovules of Welwitschia and
Bennettites. In Bennettites the microsporangia are foliar, a fact which seems to
suggest that the megasporangia are also primitively foliar. The bracts of Welwitschia are thus compared with the carpels of the Angiosperms,
the interseminal scales of Bennettites, and the ovuliferous scales of the Cycads.

10. The ovule of Welwitschia appears to have some remarkably primitive
characters.
