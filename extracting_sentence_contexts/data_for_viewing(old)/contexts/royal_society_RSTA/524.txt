Many new routes are also explored for activating CO2 by homogeneous routes, as discussed
in ยง3.4. Although scientifically attractive, none of them appear to be industrially competitive. An =
alternative route recently proposed for the indirect conversion of CO to methanol is based on :
the use of Ru pincer complexes as catalysts for the hydrogenation of carbonates, carbamates and
formates. Although this reaction shows many attractive features (atom-economy and operates nee)
in the absence of solvent with good turnover numbers), the industrial exploitability has to be
verified. It has been remarked how productivity rather than turnover is the parameter to consider [4
for industrial exploitability. DNS

There is a lot of interest in the development of new modified FT catalysts for selective a
light olefins synthesis from CO, preferably directly and not through the intermediate CO [oo
formation. The main scientific issue is related to the fact that the systems investigated are mainly .
modifications of conventional FT catalysts, rather than novel systems as probably required. The
role of COz in FT reactions remains contradictory. Hybrid FT-zeolite catalysts appear to be an
interesting possibility, but they are still not being developed on a scientific basis. Yields of over
55% in C2-C4 olefins are possible, but they need to be further increased (more than 75-80%) [32]
to exploit the process.

Significant advances in the co-polymerization of CO2 with epoxides to form cyclic and/or
polycarbonates or polyoils have been made. Various companies are exploring this route, which
appears to be close to commercialization. This route is interesting in terms of new materials
characteristics rather than in terms of its effective contribution to reducing GHG emissions.

Urea production is well established on a large scale, but there are further opportunities to
