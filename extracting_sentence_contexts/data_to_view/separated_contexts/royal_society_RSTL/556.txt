If we examine
S the values of B,, B, B, &c., we s$hall observe that all the
z odd ones (with the exception of B == =) vanish: as indeed

may easily be shown a priori from the nature of the function

A considerable simplification of the latter case takes place
owing to this circumstance : the alternate values of *B, being

susceptible of an expression by means of those of 'B : In
fact, the odd values of B vanishing (except B, ), we have
# *
={B.:+(1+Z B, + &c.) }
and, comparing the coefficients of :**+* in the two members
of this equation, we obtain

B,,pi = — (2z +1).B,,-
Hence this remarkable theorem,

which may also be regarded as affording another general ex-
pression for the numbers of BERNOVILLI. LAPLACE has shown that the NE of the function

= - may be derived from that of 7p and that, if the coeffi-
cient of 7* in the CE of the latter be represented

by a,, it will be — in that of the former.
