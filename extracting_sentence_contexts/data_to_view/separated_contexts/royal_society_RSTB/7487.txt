Whilst
it appears that the Lea Valley Arctic Bed would be the most likely source of derived
fossils, the vast amounts of material washed out from many sites have yielded few species
and few individuals apart from the locally abundant remains of Dicrostonyx henseli at
Angel Road. It is also difficult to see how derived fossils could have been concentrated
upon ‘Surface Mx’ which was a woodland surface subject to occasional flooding. Like
‘Bed D’ it was densely riddled with small animal burrows, a fact in harmony with the
view that the mammal remains are contemporary. Whatever may be said of the abundant
material from Mx, that of the second series comes from horizons of different age and

different character. The calcareous muds of zone III (see 2[b] 1V) which contain the
remains of frog, toad and lizard along with abundant leaves and fruits of Potamogeton,
contain little mineral matter, and it is difficult to see how the teeth of Dicrostonyx henseli,
Microtus ratticeps and M. anglicus could have been brought into them except in the car-
casses of the animals themselves.
