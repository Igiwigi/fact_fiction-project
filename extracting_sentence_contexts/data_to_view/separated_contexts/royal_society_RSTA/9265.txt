It must he
admitted that the air-gap if it be real raises theoretical difficulties of the most formidable
kind. There are three possible explanations :—

(1) The existence of chains of molecules such as are postulated for fluid lubricant.

(2) The existence of an attraction field on the surface of a solid with a range of at
least 0-005 mm.

(3) The presence of solid particles which keep the surfaces apart. Let us briefly summarise the difficulties of each.

(i) The difficulty here is one of degree and is sufficiently dealt with in the
text, p. 23.

(ii) To fit the facts the relatively long range force of attraction cannot be
the shadowless force contemplated in the Young-Laplace theory. It must
be capable of saturation so that its range in close packed states of matter
is reduced to molecular or even atomic limits,

(iii) Solid particles if they are present would need to be perfectly elastic and
have always the same dimensions. These conditions might be fulfilled
if the particles instead of being casual fragments of matter caught up by

the solid faces, were formed by the condensation from the air of ultra-
microscopic particles on to areas of the solid face where the attraction
field was more intense than elsewhere.
