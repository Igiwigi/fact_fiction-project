The s0lution becomes always
red from the decomposition of the iodide-of potassium. We have already seen that neither hydrogen nor nitrogen can be constituents of
ozone, whether it be obtained from electrolysis, or from the action of the electrical
spark on oxygen ; and further, that all the supposed varieties of ozone exhibit in all
respects identical properties. Connecting all these facts together, it clearly follows,â€”

That no gaseous compound having the composition HO, is formed during the
electrolysis of water ; and

That ozone, from whatever source derived, is one and the same body, having
identical properties and the same constitution, and is not a compound body, but
oxygen in an altered or allotropic condition.
