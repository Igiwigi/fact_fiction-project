4. Discussion

Implications from observations and modelling of SN line polarization can be summarized as
follows. (i) The element distribution in the SN ejecta is not completely 2D axisymmetric. (ii) A
3D clumpy component is present. (iii) The typical size of the clumps is relatively large, i.e. 2 25%
of the photosphere. It is interesting to note that such a large-scale clumpy structure is also seen in
the element distribution of Cassiopeia A [54-57].

One possible scenario to produce a clumpy structure in the ejecta is the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)
instability developed during the shock propagation in the stellar envelope. However, the RT
instability tends to produce small fingers in many directions, which does not effectively produce
the polarization. A relatively large-scale structure required for polarization is more in favour
of large-scale convection or SASI. In fact, numerical simulations show that, if the large-scale
convection or SASI takes place at the onset of the explosion, the resultant element distribution
at the later phase retains an imprint of the large-scale asymmetry in addition to the small-scale
structures added by the RT instability [58-61].

More and more long-term simulations from the onset of the explosion to shock breakout
become available (e.g. [61,62]), and thus full radiative transfer modelling for polarization (e.g. [38,
63]) using such results will enable direct mapping of explosion models and observables. From the
