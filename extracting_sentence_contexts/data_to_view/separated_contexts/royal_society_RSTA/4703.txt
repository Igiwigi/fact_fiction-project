Let us consider the category Agin of all rational Weyl algebras with canonical embeddings as
morphisms. We have that an algebra A = A(a, b) â‚¬ Agi is an affine prime algebra over C generated
over its centre Z(A) as a module. In fact, we have that both A and Z(A) are prime Noetherian
principal ideal rings. Every maximal ideal of A is of the form &@ = Aa for a in Spec(Z(A)), and an
isomorphism type of an irreducible module V is fully determined by a such that Ann(V) = @. We
call this A-module V 4(a).
