been s0mewhat diligently tilled and laboured, some one has usually arisen, confident in his talent, and accepted
and celebrated on account of the compendiousness of his method, who, in 80 far as regards appearances, has
established the art, but in reality has corrupted the labours of his predecessors. Yet what he has done is wont
to be well-pleasing to succeeding generations on account of the casy utility of his work, and their wearisome-

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE OSTRICH TRIBE. 147

8igns, such oblique and interwoven knots of nature; and the journey over it is to be con-
stantly made under the uncertain light of the senses, sometimes shining out, sometimes
hiding itself, through the forests of experience and particular facts”*,

The prodigal development of the bird's basisphenoid (Plate XIII. figs. 1, 2, & 3) is
seen, not merely in its breadth but also in its length, reaching, as it does, sometimes to
the furthest end of the base of the nasal septum ; in its vertical growth also, seeing that
it shoots upwards to form a very considerable moiety of the interorbital septum, and in
thus joining the great vertical ethmoid, leaves but little territory to the presphenoid. In
these generalized birds (the Ostriches), 80 near to the Reptiles and to the Mammals, it
might have been expected that the basisxphenoid would have derived a feebleness on
both hands, from its relation to that of these outlying congeners. In one respect it
does 80, viz. in the symmetrical autogenous basitemporal portion; not 80 the azygous
piece, or true basisphenoid ; for here in these very birds its transverse growth attains its
fulness: every one will see that a free growth of the © investing mass” lies at the root of
