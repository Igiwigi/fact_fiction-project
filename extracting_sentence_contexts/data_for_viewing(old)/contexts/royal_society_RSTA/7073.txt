It was stated earlier that when there is no pressure gradient the dp/dx term in (3-135)
drops out and that Emmons & Brainerd have shown that the system of equations (3-13) have
a solution in which u, v /x, p and T are functions of y/,/x only; the equations can then be
reduced exactly to a set of three ordinary differential equations whose solutions can be
evaluated mechanically by the differential analyzer. Emmons & Brainerd (1941, 1942)
have given solutions of this system for constant viscosity and for various viscosity laws
respectively, and these have been used as a standard of comparison for the various approxi-
mate solutions given earlier. In addition, their work shows that in this case the boundary
layer does not separate from the solid boundary, so that, as in the incompressible case, it is
necessary to have retarded flow in order to get separation.

The fact that for no pressure gradient the solution is a function of y/./x only suggests that
when there is a pressure gradient it will be possible to work as in the incompressible case in
terms of x and y/./x as independent variables, and it can be hoped that the variation of the
various quantities with x at constant y//x will be slow, smooth and easy to handle.

The simplest case to consider seems to be that of constant pressure gradient in the main stream,
rather than constant velocity gradient as taken by Howarth (1938 and F.D. p. 173); more-
over measurements show that for flow round a projectile with a streamline base (figure 1,
top photograph) the pressure gradient is often nearly constant over the streamlined portion,
so that the choice of constant pressure gradient corresponds to an eminently practical case.

For generality let the pressure gradient be written
