Now, as regards Lyginodendron, the distinctively Fern-like character is limited to
the foliage; this, however, is not the case with the other genus. Apart from the â€”
secondary growth, the stem of Heterangium is essentially that of a monostelic Fern
of the Gleichenia type. The resemblance of the stele of Heterangiwm to that of a
Gleichenia is, in fact, very marked, as regards the distribution of the tracheides and
conjunctive parenchyma, the position of the protoxylem-groups, and the presence of
a wide pericycle. We think the comparison with Gleichenia may prove to be a fertile
one, and hope to pursue it further on another occasion. It is not at all unlikely that
the Gleichenia type of structure may be of great antiquity.
