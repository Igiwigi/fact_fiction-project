Maxwetr calculated their values, however, by
quadrature, in the special case n = 5 (the forces being repulsive), and found that*

(49) P (5) = 2°6595, (5) = 1°3682.

15. Rigid Elastic Spheres which Attract One Another. It is an undoubted fact that molecules attract one another at small distances (as is
manifest from the force of cohesion, to take but a single example). By considering
the effect of such forces in bringing about collisions between molecules (regarded as
rigid elastic spheres) which would otherwise pass by one another, SurHERLANDt had
great success in explaining the variation of viscosity with temperature. His
treatment of the problem, while very suggestive, and forming an important
contribution to the kinetic theory, laid no claim to rigour.
