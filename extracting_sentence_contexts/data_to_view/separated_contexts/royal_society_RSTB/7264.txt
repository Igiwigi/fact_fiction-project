Thus Straus (1948) has concluded from a biometrical and statistical
analysis that the distal end of a humerus attributed by Broom to Paranthropus, and which
both he (Broom & Schepers 1946) and Le Gros Clark (1947a, 5) have claimed to be

essentially human in form, is *...no more hominid than it is anthropoid’. Furthermore,
Kern & Straus (1949), by a similar metrical analysis, have shown that the distal end of
a femur of Plesianthropus, which Broom (1946) and Le Gros Clark (19474, 6) have again
claimed to be human in form, is not exclusively hominid, for, although not resembling the
great apes, it resembles man and the Cercopithecid monkeys in about equal degree. This
divergence of views seems to be due to the fact that the statements of Broom and Le Gros
Clark about the limb-bones of the fossils were not backed by an adequate quantitative
study of the corresponding structures in existing Primates. TABLE 14. DIMENSIONAL CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN THE TEETH OF FOSSIL AND
