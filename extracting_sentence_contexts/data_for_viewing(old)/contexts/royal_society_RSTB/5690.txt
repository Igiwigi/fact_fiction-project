Tt has been shown that the primitive method of hatching of ascidian larve is by
digesting the egg-membrane with a proteolytic enzyme, and that this enzyme is very

unstable.* Its presence is typical, however, of embryos forming from very small eggs
rather than from those where there has been marked accumulation of yolk; so that
its absence in all embryos developing anurally, whether from eggs small or large, is a
fact needing explanation.

There are two possibilities. Any disturbance in the general course of development,
such as the breakdown of the tail structures, may involve an inactivation of the enzyme.
In this case only those species with anural development survive that possess an efficient
alternative method of hatching, and that have a habitat of such a nature that a free-
swimming phase is unnecessary.

Alternatively the enzyme may become inactive or lost, when only those species
survive that are able to hatch by means of the rupture method, and probably where
an active free-swimming larval existence again is unnecessary. However, loss of the
enzyme does not necessarily imply loss of the tadpole stage since the viviparous forms
with large eggs hatch by rupture and yet have succeeded in retaining the tadpole
