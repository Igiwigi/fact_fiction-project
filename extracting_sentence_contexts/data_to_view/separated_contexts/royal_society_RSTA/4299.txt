For the latter, we used a value of h = 0.777 for the thermal accommodation coefficient
at all temperatures, which was derived from low-pressure measurements at Typw in our previous
work [5]. We investigate the effects of a temperature-dependent h in §4c(vii). Another small
correction was applied for the fact that the ‘isotherms’ are not truly isothermal owing to small
variations in the average Tog at each pressure. Each f;' on an isotherm was corrected to a common
Tog using an expression derived from equation (4.11). The uncertainty in the acoustic corrections
is discussed in §4c(vii).
