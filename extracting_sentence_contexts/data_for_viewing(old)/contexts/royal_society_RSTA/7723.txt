When we work out the value for the electric moment we find this to be

e — w? — LT wo

There are several points to be noted here. Firstly, this differs from the result
given in the previous paper, where w replaced w, in the damping factor.

Secondly, it differs from the usual form given by Drupe’s theory of dispersion,
as can be seen from the fact that

(w) — w?)? + 41 2w)

Here «, replaces in the numerator and denominator. It is perhaps instructive
to note that one can deduce this difference from the general principles underlying
the theory. The fact that I is not zero means that we have combination vibrations
which are capable of absorbing energy ; hence we must conclude that the absorption
coefficient cannot tend to zero as long as I’ remains finite. On the old dispersion
theory & tends to zero as w tends to zero, which does not fit in with the conclusions
we have just reached. The above formula shows that & tends to a constant
value as @ tends to zero, which is in agreement with the general conclusions. It
may, however, be noted that in general T will become zero before we come to
