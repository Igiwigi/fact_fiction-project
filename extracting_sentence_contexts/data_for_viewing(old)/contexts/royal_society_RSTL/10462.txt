ELHE origin of the tendency among the earlier morphologists to draw a sharp distine-
Zion between stem and leaf may most probably be traced to the fact that vegetable
-Znorphology was firsb pursued as a science in regions where deciduous trees prevail.
Seeing the leaves of 80 many plants fall off as a whole, while the scar left was almost
direct continuation of the external gurface of the stem, doubtless gave rise to the
-Fiew that the two should be regarded as radically distinct members.
E As the science of morphology progressed it became necessary, if this distinction
Frero to be maintained, to define more clearly how members belonging to these two
Sategories differ one from another. Various attempts were made by authors to show in
Swat the essential difference consisted, the most notable being that of HorwesrER,*
gvho brought forward a number of distinctions, based chiefly upon development.
Elhe most exsential of these were adopted in that section of the Text Book of
Baons,t which deals with the relations of leaves and leaf-forming axes. In the last
aragraph (No. 8) of that section, he clearly lays down the principle that © the
