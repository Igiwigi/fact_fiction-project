this substance diffused through water, it became of a red-brown
colour, and the fluid obtained by filtration produced a distinet
precipitate with solution of galls. The acids have less affinity for
tannin than for gelatine; and, in cases where compounds of the
acids and tannin are acted on by solution of gelatine, an equi-
librium of affinity is established, in consequence of which, by
far the greatest quantity of tannin is carried down in the inso-
luble combination. The different neutral salts have, compara-
tively, feeble powers of attraction for the tanning principle ; but,
that the precipitation they occasion in astringent solutions, is
not simply owing to the circumstance of their uniting to a por-
tion of the water which held the vegetable substances in s0-
lution, is evident from many facts, besides those which have
been already stated. The solutions of alum, and of some
other salts which are less soluble in water than tannin, pro-
duce, in many astringent infusions, precipitates as copious as
the more s0luble saline matters ; and sulphate of lime, and other
earthy neutral compounds, which are, comparatively speaking,
insoluble in water, speedily deprive them of their tanning prin-
ciple.

From the different facts that have been stated, it is evident
that tannin may exist in a $tate of combination in different sub-
stances, in which its presence cannot be made evident by means
of solution of gelatine ; and, in this case, to detect its existence,
