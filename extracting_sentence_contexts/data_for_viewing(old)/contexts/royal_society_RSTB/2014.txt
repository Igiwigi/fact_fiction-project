the gelatine by the growth of the organism is accentuated by the condensation of
water on the cover-glass, and in such cases I have often seen a small zooglcea in the
denser portion of the drop burst, as it were, and its component rods and chains
stream out into the dilute portion of the drop, where they continue their growth
without any sign of a firm gelatinous sheath (Plate 15, figs. 2 and 3), As comfirmatory
of this fact it may be mentioned that the slight ring and deposit which this organism
slowly produces in tubes of broth or saccharose-broth is found to consist of rods and
chains the sheaths of which have almost or quite dissolved. It may therefore be
concluded that while this organism is normally capsuled in fresh cultures and in
certain media containing carbohydrates, and under such circumstances is gelatinous
or viscous, this character gradually disappears as the culture ages, as it becomes
dilute, or as the organism is subjected to repeated transfers in the same gelatine
medium; and further, that on media containing no carbohydrates the gelatinous
sheath is very much reduced, if not altogether wanting.

In liquid cultures, as stated above, the organism is not capsuled and growth is
very slow. Thus in broth or saccharose-broth at ordinary temperatures, a slight
ring is formed in the course of a week, and upon shaking the tube a very faint
