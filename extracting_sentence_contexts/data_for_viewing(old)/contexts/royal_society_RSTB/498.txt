6. Summary of Results.

We have, therefore, by means of an increase in intra-cranial pressure caused decrease
and alteration of functional activity, partial or complete, of three “ centres” existing
in the medulla, The effect of the pressure has been both excitatory and paralytic,
according to its degree, and the series of events followed one another in a definite
order. We will summarise the facts observed under the headings we have already
employed.

Lhe Heart.—Slight pressure reduced the rapid heart-beat of the Dog to 130 or so per
minute in the same way as deep etherisation. Intermissions of the heart-beat some-
times occurred before any marked slowing. With further pressure the heart was
slowed and arrested. The immediate removal of the pressure after arrest of the heart,
or at most before the expiration of 10 or 20 seconds, allowed the heart to start
again, but unlike the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, the arrest of the heart
continued unless the pressure was removed, Artificial respiration cannot prevent the
heart from being arrested, although a more severe pressure may be required to effect
this than when artificial respiration is not in use. However, this power of arresting
the heart is quickly weakened, and the heart starts again, whilst that pressure
