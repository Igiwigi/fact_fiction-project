them, not less to supply the means for a just estimate of the value of my meteorolo-
gical observations, than to enable meteorologists who may tread in my steps to benefit
by my experience and disasters.

The barometrical means haye been reduced to 32* Fans. by Professor Scuumacusr's
tables, with corrections for the expansion of the brass scale ; and the monthly means
for 1830 were obtained by the ingenious process recommended by Professor Forsxs.

In regard to the following barometrical obseryations, I must premise, that my
three best barometers, although precisely of the same construction and placed under
precisely similar cireumstances, would occasionally differ slightly from each other,
not only in the amount of the oscillations, but in the period at which the several tides
turned ; and this fact is of some importance to those who may be disposed to rely
too confidently upon the indications of a single instrument.

My erratic life necessarily disabled me from determining the mean absolute height
of the barometer at any one place for a period exceeding five or six consecutive
months, excepting for the year 1830. I cannot, therefore, state the annual range of
the barometer for several years successively ; but repeated returns to Poona in vari-
ous months of the year would have supplied the materials for tolerably just estimates,
even had I not one entire year's observations made at Poona. 'The monthly range is
recorded for many complete months, and the diurnal range for six years with few
omissions ; but I propose to confine my deductions to my observations for the last

four years, as the instruments I had in use at first (Joxss's) did not admit of a
