Haversian and other Canals of Bone â€”The Haversian canals have been described
by all recent writers on the snbject of bone; their variable size and not nnfrequent
anastomoses have been pointed ont; and the fact of the larger apertures in the
spongy parts of bone being similar in the structure of their parietes to the smaller
ones in the denser parts of the osseous tissue has not failed to be recognized. It may

surface. When examining sections of bone it is necessary to bear this fact in mind,
for on a close inspection it will be seen that there are other spaces which possess a
