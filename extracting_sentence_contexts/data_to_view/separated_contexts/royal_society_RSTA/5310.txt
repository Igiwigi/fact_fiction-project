a The mariners on board a ship at sea, it is to be observed, however, have direct
Spognizance only of the wind blowing at the spot on the ocean’s expanse where for the
‘Stime being their ship is situated. They can make no observations on the winds
blowing at the same moment 100 miles away, and the vault of the sky above them
S/presents to their eyes no adequate indication of the upper currents, or of the places
whence these come or whither they are going in their circuits. But even long ago, by
# the collation among navigators of facts contemporaneously observed by various seamen,
important knowledge was acquired gradually as to the general character of contempo-
“raneously existing air currents at the surface of the sea, without the aid of any
g trustworthy theory as to the continuations of such currents in circulation through the
Beer regions of the atmosphere. It is further to be noticed that the geographical
2 distribution of sea and land, presenting as it does great regions of ocean, and large
A continents themselves varied with mountain ranges and low-lying plains, introduces
great local variations in the conditions determining the courses of winds, and prevents
the institution of any complete uniformity in the character of the air currents all
round the Equator, or throughout zones between any parallels of latitude. But in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans there are extensive regions within, and
adjacent to, the Torrid Zone, in which the winds blow with remarkable constancy
from the east while converging also from north and south at the two sides, towards a
medial belt of calms and rains which is situated along, or very near to, the Equator.
