grouped within, and all the cations without. If any number of them enter as ions
into the constitution of electrolytes, and, forming one circuit, are simultaneously
subject to one common current, the anions must moye in accordance with each
other in one direction, and the cations in the other. Nay, more than that, equiva-
lent portions of these bodies must 80 advance in opposite directions ; for the advance
of every 325 parts of the zine þ must be accompanied by a motion in the opposite
direction of 8 parts of oxygen at d, of 36 parts of chlorine at g, of 126 parts of iodine
at /; and in the same direction by electro-chemical equivalents of hydrogen, lead,
copper and tin, at e, k, k, and m.

965, If the present paper be accepted as a correct expression of facts, it will still
only prove a confirmation of certain general views put forth by Sir Humeary Davy in
his Bakerian Lecture for 1806*, and revised and re-stated by him in another Ba-
kerian Lecture, on electrical and chemical changes, for the year 1826 +. His gene-
ral statement is, that © chemical and electrical attractions were produced by the same
cause, acting in one case on particles, in the other on masses, of matter ; and that the
same property, under different modifications, was the cause of all the phenomena exhi-
bited by different voltaic combinations {,” This statement I believe to be true ; but
in admitting and supporting it, I must guard myself from being supposed to assent
to all that is associated with it in the two papers referred to, or as admitting the
experiments which are there quoted as decided proofs of the truth of the principle.
Had I thought them 80, there would have been no occasion for this investigation.
It may be supposed by some that I ought to go through these papers, distinguishing
