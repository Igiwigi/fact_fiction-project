That the Haloniw were young terminal branches, and not
roots, as many, including Bronenrart himself, were inclined to believe, was in like
manner set at rest, first by the final demonstration that the Stigmarie were the true
roots of. the Lepidodendra, and, secondly, by my publication of the figure of the grand
specimen in the museum of the Leeds Philosophical Society,* which settled, beyond
all possibility of question, the fact that Halonie were the terminal divisions of Lepi-
dodendroid branches. Starting from this foundation, I shall proceed to examine such
facts as we are now acquainted with bearing upon this question. * Memoir XII., Plate 34, 1883. 14 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

In the first place Bronenrarrâ€™s division of Ulodendra and Halonia into two groups,
in the former of which the tubercles are in the centre of large flattened scars arranged
in two vertical series on opposite sides of the stem, whilst in the latter we have
numerous rows of similar tubercles arranged quincunctially, can no longer be
accepted.
