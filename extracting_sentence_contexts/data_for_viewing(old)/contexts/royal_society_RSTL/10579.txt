Alittle growth of leaf from the base. Another character incident to that of the coarse
Sn luxuriant stemmy growth of a few individual species is that the turf of this plot
(14) i is less compact and looser than that of plob 9, and of most of the other plots.
RZAccording to the season of growth, or of those preceding it, one or other of the most
Sprominont plants attracted attention, and gave character to the plot. The produce
vas always ready to be cut much earlier than that on any other plot ; the stems being
Zgenerally ripe, and eyen dead at the bottom, before the herbage on most of the other
Splots was ready for cutting. Owing to this, and to the most prominent plants flowering
And seeding early, and frequently shedding seed before cutting, their permanence was
Sfavoured. This was especially the case with Bromus mollts, which frequently produced
- Szeed in the first growth, and gave an abundance of seedling plants in the second, On
-Sthe other hand, the fact of this plant being usually annual, or biennial only, may serve
to account for the great fluctuation in its degree of prominence in the different seasons,
Edependent presumably on the climatal cireumstances having been favourable or other-
Size for its reproduction and persistence. Again, the fact of the occurrence of tubers
Zon the roots, which has been observed in this plant on this plot, may perhaps be taken
Eto indicate a tendency to assume a perennial duration.
EZ In conclusion, the contrast brought to view between the occurrence and predomi-
Snance of different species on two plots manured in many respects 80 very similarly as
Splots 9 and 14, the only difference being that of the condition of combination in which
Sthe nitrogen is 8upplied, is exceedingly remarkable. The result affords a striking
Zillustration of the influence upon a flora, of variations of condibions of growth which
A&would at firs 8ight appear comparatively unimportant. There was also a difference in
the character of growth, dependent in part on the diversity in the natural © habit” of
