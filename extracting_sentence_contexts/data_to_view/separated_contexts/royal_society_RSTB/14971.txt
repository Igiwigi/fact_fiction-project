Patterned practices affect the nervous system, muscles, connective tissue and functioning of our
organism. The mechanisms through which physiology enables cultural expression and through which patterns of practice
canalize phenotypic plasticity turn out to be widely varied, multi-directional, operating on a variety of time scales and variably
accessible to reflection or intentional action. In fact, gaining expertise in freediving can be likened to a succession of stages in which practitioners’ growing proficiency
exposes their bodies to more stressful environments and new adaptive challenges. Earlier progress, whether changes in
technique, altered perceptions or blunted neurological responses, set up more severe environmental conditions within which
further physiological adaptations arise. In other work on cultural canalization of neuroplasticity, this process has been called
a ‘behavioural-developmental spiral’ because alterations occur at multiple levels, from the volitional and perceptual to the
behavioural and physiological [27,28].
