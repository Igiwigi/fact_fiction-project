Zvould be a physical equilibrium but no chemical, because all the water that was carried
Znto the lake would contain different mineral substances, which the rain-water had dis-
Solved from the country which the river drains, while the loss by evaporation would be
Sure water. The quantity of saline sbstances in the lake would constantly go on
Ancreasing until chemical changes would occasion the precipitation of different salts.
By comparing the chemical constitution of the water of the Rhine, we might form an
idea of the different elements contained in the water of this lake. We should find that
among the bases the lime was prevailing, and next to it the magnesia, next to it the
Soda, the iron, the manganese, the alumina, and potash. Of acids the carbonic would
be prevailing, and next to it the sulphuric, the muriatic (chlorine), and the silicic.
Now all these substances are found in sea-water, but the proportions are quite different.

* The potash which T have mentioned here represents in fact not the mean of all the observations in the
great ocean, but only the mean of a number of determinations for the northern part of the Atlantic, my older
observations on the quantity of potash in the other parts of the ocean being not exact enough. This quantity
of potash differs most probably very little from the real mean.

The ocean is in fact such a lake, into which all the rivers carry what they have dissolved
from the land, and from which pure water evaporates; and whatever we think about
the constitution of the primitive ocean, this effect of the rivers, which has lasted for
