If, agreeably to the views hitherto developed, the nitric acid
formed on electrifying moist atmospheric air; electrolysing water charged with some
azote; or making phosphorus to act on a moist mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,
owes its origin to the ozone being produced under those cireumstances, what is the
cause of the generation of that acid which is formed during the putrefaetion of
azotic substances being in contact with strong bases and air? The putrefaction of
those substances consisting, as it is well known, partly at least, in an act of oxida-
tion or slow combustion of their oxidable constituent parts, and it being a fact that
during the slow combustion of phosphorus, vapour of ether, or alcohol in atmospheric
air, a highly oxidizing agent (ozone) makes its appearance, we may be allowed to
compare the slow combustion of phosphorus with the putrefaction of azotic organic
matters, both of them taking place in the atmosphere. And if it be a fact that during
the slow combustion of phosphorus and ether, ozone is produced, it does not seem to
be an over-bold conjecture to suppose that ozone is also formed during the putrefac-
tion of azotic substances, and the nitrogen of those matters oxidized into nitric acid. As phosphorus which contains no trace of nitrogen, nevertheless forms nitric acid-on
its being slowly burned in atmospheric air, it seems to be not, impossible that organic
substances containing no nitrogen produce also ozone, and along with it nitric acid
during the slow oxidation they undergo in atmospheric air. It seems to me to be im-
portant to ascertain, by accurate experiments, whether, under the circumstances last
mentioned, nitric acid or nitrates are formed.
