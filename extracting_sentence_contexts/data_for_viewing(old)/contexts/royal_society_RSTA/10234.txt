It is proposed to reserve the general discussion of the questions of dissociation and
rate of cooling for the third part of the present research ; we shall then be dealing
with gaseous mixtures of simple composition which will serve as a natural introduction
to the consideration of more complicated questions. A few words are, however,
necessary with regard to the somewhat unusual conditions under which the cooling
of the products of combustion of a solid explosive takes place.

Under ordinary circumstances the convection and conductivity of the gas itself are
the ruling factors which determine the rate of cooling.

The thermal capacity of the gaseous mixture and the rate at which heat can be
transmitted through it are low compared with the corresponding properties of the
enclosure. These facts hold true whether the latter is water-cooled or not.

In such cases neither the inner surface of the enclosure nor the layer of gas in
