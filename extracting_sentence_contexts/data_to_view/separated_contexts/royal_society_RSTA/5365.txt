The current was supplied from
storage cells in the battery room of the laboratory, and the wires conveying the
current into the room in which the experiment was conducted were not satisfactorily
insulated from other wires conveying a current from other cells into a different room, -
Fluctuations in the current were caused when these other cells were working. . Experiment 3, August 5. The curves are shown in Plate 16, It will be seen that the variations are much
less ; in fact, the curves for V and W are very approximately parallel straight
lines, showing that the changes are almost entirely due to the alterations in the
Leclanchés. The mean values are—

V = 3691°2,
W = 6751°5.

Bowls I. and II. used. In each of these three experiments some of the deposit in Bowl No. II. was lost i
the washing, and the results from this bowl have not been used.
