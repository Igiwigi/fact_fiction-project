He explains the. appearance. of the elements at, a distance from each other
by, referring. to, a snccession of decompositions and, recompositions occurring
amongst the intervening. particles |, and he thinks, it probable that those
which are about to. separate. at the poles.unite to the-two. electricities: there,
and in consequence become gases.

482. Sir Humeary Davyy's celebrated, Bakerian Lecture on. some chemical
agencies of electricity was read in Noyember 1806, and, is almost entirely occu-
pied in the. consideration of electro-chemical decompositions. The facts are of the
utmost, value, and, with the general points established, are, uniyersally known.
'The, mode of actipn. by which. the [effects take place is stated-yery, generally,
s0 generally, indeed, that probably.a dozen precise schemes. of electro-chemical
action might be drawn up, differing. essentially, from each, other, yet all agree-
ing with the statement there given.

483. When Sir Humpary Davy uses more particular expressions, he seems
to refer the decomposing effects to the attractions;of the poles. This is the case
in the. © general expression. of facts” given. at-pp. 28 and 29 of the Philosophical
Transactions for 1807, also at,p. 30.
