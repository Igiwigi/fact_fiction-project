= However, when specimens have a susceptibility of the order of 10-8, as is the case for
£metals and most other materials, the deflexions obtained are too small to allow accurate
g centring. Strongly paramagnetic salts with k~ 10~* would be adequate, but are incon-
£ venient to use.
S However, it was noted during an experiment with a copper cylinder that, whenever the
& cylinder was raised or lowered a large ballistic swing of the magnetometer was produced,
due clearly to the currents induced in the cylinder by the field of the magnetometer. These
& deflexions were found to vary with x and y according to (47a), that is, the deflexion was zero
when the axis of the cylinder was in the plane z Ox or z Oy (figure 13), and varied quadratic-
ally with the horizontal displacement r along any line not on these axes. In fact, during its
vertical motion the copper cylinder behaves like a highly diamagnetic body, owing to its
high conductivity. Provided the vertical motion had a duration short compared with the
period of swing of the magnetometer the swing is truly ballistic, i.e. the swing is independent
of the rate of movement.
An approximate calculation can easily be made of the ballistic swing of a magnetometer
when a small conducting body of dimensions a and conductivity p is raised quickly from a
large distance to a distance z below the lower magnet of the magnetometer. It can be
