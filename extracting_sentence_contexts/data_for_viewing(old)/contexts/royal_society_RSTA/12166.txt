3 however be guided along conducting wires, as in alternate-current dynamos. The
2 ¢ phenomena of electric currents in ordinary conducting circuits are thus more general
IE than the phenomena of vortex-rings in hydrodynamics, or of atomic electric currents,
4 in that the strengths of the currents in them are not constrained to remain constant ;
an additional displacement current can, so to speak, flow into a conductor at any
6 of its breaches of continuity. The variables of the problem are thus more numerous,
"g and the energy-function leads to more equations connecting them.

& 957. We might now attempt to proceed, by including the mechanical energy of the
material conductors in the same function as the electro-kinetic energy, thus deducing
@ that the energy gained by altering the co-ordinate ¢, is (dT'/d¢,) 5¢,, in other words
that the displacement 8¢, is opposed by a force equal to dT/d¢,. This would make
currents flowing in the same direction along parallel wires repel each other, and in fact
generally the force thus indicated is just the opposite to the reality.
The expression T represents completely the energy of the system so far as electro-
_ Motive disturbances are concerned, as has been proved above. But we have no right
to assume that -the energy of the system, so far as to include movements of the
conductors and mechanical ‘forces, can be completely expressed by this formula with
only the electric co-ordinates and the sensible co-ordinates of the matter involved in it ;
for the mechanism that links them together is too complicated to be treated other-
wise than statistically. We may however proceed as in the electrostatic problem ; a
