may be considered satisfactory ; the greatest differences, which are observed in the case
of sample A, may in part be due to the fact that, unfortunately, in Series I. no obser-
vations could be made at temperatures below 7*; but as we have adopted the means of
the different equations obtained for each series as the true expressions of the expansions,
and as these formule are, as we shall see hereafter, connected together by a simple
relation, which that referring to A obeys on the whole satisfactorily, we have not
thought it necessary to repeat the experiments, as those already obtained prove suffi-
ciently accurate for our purpose when thus checked. The mean values of the constants given in Table X. are exhibited in Table XITI., and
are the coefficients of the powers of # in the formulze we adopt as expressing in each
case the relation between the volumes and the temperatures of the solutions submitted
to experiment, and to which we shall hereafter refer as the mean formulze. TapLt XII.
