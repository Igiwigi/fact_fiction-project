to elapse between the impregnation and parturition of the latter animal ; but the pre-
cautions taken to ensure accuracy in the obseryations which led to the determination of
the period of thirty-nine days were such as to admit of no source of error; and the size
of the mammary foetus figured by Sir Everarr Hows in the 85th volume of the Philo-
sophical Transactions could hardly be reconciled with the duration of four months
assigned to uterine gestation in the Kangaroo by Professor Georrroy ST. HiLaiks *,

The period of gestation was determined in a female Kangaroo in the Menagerie of
the Zoological Society. She was placed with the male only at such times as they could
be watched. She had a young one of the previous year, which had quitted the pouch,
but was still sneking occasionally. The coitus was observed on the 27th August 1833,
at 1P.m.; and as it was known that she could not have had intercourse with the male
for three months prior to this date, that fact, and the size of the young one when she
was selected for the experiment, left no doubt of her being unimpregnated until the date
above mentioned. She was separated from the male the same day, and was kept apart
in a separate shed and paddock until parturition took place. And here I must ex-
press ny great obligations to the Council of the Zoological Society for the permission
given me to conduct my. experiments under circumstances 80 favourable as are
afforded in their noble Vivarium : every arrangement in the building appropriated to
the kangaroos which could facilitate my observations on them was promptly effected,
and the services of an intelligent keeper were allotted to me.

In order to inure the female to the examinations of the pouch when they should
become indispensable, they were commenced six days after the copulation, and were
repeated every morning and evening until the 5th October, when, at 7 a.m., the
