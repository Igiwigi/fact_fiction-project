It was largely the presence of these anomalies that led us to suppose that simple
dominance was not the rule; and we suggested that E broods were genotypically
dextral broods whose normal phenotypic expression had been in some way suppressed,
while the dextral break-throughs associated with them were those broods that had
broken through this suppression and reverted to the normal expression of their geno-
type. Similarly F broods were regarded as suppressed sinistral broods. It was thought
possible that these two types of suppression might be associated with the two types of
heterozygote, though the possibility that the phenomena might be the expression of
genetic factors was recognised.

The establishment of the fact of dextral dominance necessitates some modification
of these views. In particular the interpretation previously offered of dextral break-
throughs and with them of E broods falls to the ground. The simplest way of regarding
dextral break-throughs is as reverse mutations. Our previous view that F broods are
* suppressed‚Äù or converted sinistral broods still holds, but it seems probable that
they are only special cases of dextral break-throughs. The tendency to give E broods
is now definitely known to be inherited and strains showing this tendency in a high
degree can be extracted from sinistral stocks by selective line breeding. There is no
evidence that E broods are due to extra-nuclear (7.e., cytoplasmic) factors and broadly
speaking our results are compatible with the idea that they are caused by nuclear
factors or genes, though some non-factorial unknown is not excluded.

The majority of these discrepant facts can be brought under one heading by saying
