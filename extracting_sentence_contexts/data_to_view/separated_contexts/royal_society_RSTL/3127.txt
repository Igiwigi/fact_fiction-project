The temperature derived from the average with
zine would be 16907, and the corresponding temperature in the Table is 1750*. The temperature derived from the average with tin would be 1607*, but the
corresponding temperature is only 1446*.

4thly. That a similar power in tin to depress the melting point of another
metal is exhibited in pewter; in which we may observe that a mixture of one
fifth of tin with lead reduces the melting point actually below that of either of
the pure metals; and we may recall to recollection the fact, that an alloy of
eight parts of bismuth, whose fusing point is 476* ; five of lead, whose fusing
point is 612*; and three of tin, whose fusing point is 442®, —liquefies at 212®. I shall here snhjoin a Table, in the usnal form, of the progressive linear di-
latation by heat of such solids as I have measured with the pyrometer to the
boiling point of water, the boiling point of mercury, and their respective
melting points, where they have been ascertained. I have added to their
apparent expansions by the register the corresponding expansion of the black-
lead ; upon the assumption that the latter continues at an equal rate to tempe-
ratures above 662*; in which it is not probable, from the preceding observa-
tions, that there is any error of material importance.
