This latter, apparently, is a synaptic layer in which the
octavus neurites arborize among the dendrites from the cell layer, and in turn the
neurites of these cells form the emerging fibres of the transverse commissure. The entire
arrangement here is strikingly similar to the three layers of the tuberculum acusticum. Intimately associated with the outer part of the torus semicircularis is the “ tiefes
Mark.”’ In fact, Ravi (1915, p. 529) considers the “ tiefes Mark” as one of the
four parts into which he divides the torus. In Diaphus the amount of exchange of
fibres between this system and the torus is very difficult to determine. The torus semicircularis, besides the large connections with the lateral longitudinal
fasciculus and the commissura transversa, has lesser connections with the ganglion
isthmi. ;
