Such aposematism can also be
found among orthopterans in early instars, demonstrating it
is an important element in the whole life history of orthopter-
ans [26,35]. However, compared with plant-like mimesis and
crypsis [25,38], aposematism rarely occurs among extant ensi-
ferans. In fact, plant-like mimesis is an ancient survival
strategy in preyâ€”predator interaction that dates back to the
Permian, while no aposematism has been reported in the
fossil record during the evolutionary history of ensiferans
[39-41]. The presence of aposematic coloration in Monitelcana
penalveri gen. et sp. nov., which is uniformly distributed
on the whole body irrespective of different organs, implies
that aposematic coloration was an important survival
strategy for ensiferans in the Cretaceous. Our find of an elca-
nid nymph from the Mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber also
suggests that, for the first time, orthopterans had evolved
aposematism by the Mid-Cretaceous.

(c) Antipredator adaptations in the Mesozoic

Fossil insects are usually preserved as adpressions or
inclusions without lighter pigment colour [42]; structural
colour is also infrequently discovered in fossil insects owing
to the incomplete preservation of ultrastructure [43-46].
