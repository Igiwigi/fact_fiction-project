(6) The fact that the gyroscopic torques during pitching and rolling movements differ
only by a constant depending on the sweep-back of the halteres from the transverse axis
of the fly necessarily implies that the fly could only distinguish between these two planes
of rotation by a comparison of the phasing of the torques from the halteres on the two

sides of the body, the two torques being in phase during pitching movements and in anti-
phase during rolling movements. The experiments quoted by Fraenkel (1939) showing the
slight effect of unilateral haltere extirpation suggest that such a phase comparison is not
an important part of the nervous mechanism associated with the haltere, a conclusion
which is supported by the fact that under certain circumstances it is possible to make the
two halteres of a fly oscillate at different frequencies (Sellke 1936; see also p. 357). This
treatment, which does not affect the ability of the insect to fly, would completely upset
any nervous mechanism dependent on phase comparisons between the two sides.

(7) It was pointed out above that in order to produce a simple theoretical treatment of
the dynamics of the haltere it is necessary to assume that the moving portion is a rigid
structure. If one examines more precisely the effect on the
dynamics of the system of departures from rigidity, it becomes
apparent that flexibility in a lateral direction is much more
serious than flexibility in a vertical direction. The full torque
of any gyroscopic system is only developed if the system is
restrained. Two features of the structure of the haltere suggest
