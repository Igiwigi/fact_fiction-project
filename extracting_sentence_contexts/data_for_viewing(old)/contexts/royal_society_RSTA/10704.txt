magnetic moment per unit volume, the volume being obtained from the mass and
density. From the figures given in the table, or more clearly from the curve given
in Diagram IIL., it is seen that the intensity steadily mounts upwards as the drawing
proceeds. The maximum intensity reached is about 930 units; altogether the
residual intensity, after magnetisation, has been increased from 469 at the first
drawing to 930 at the last, for magnets 100 diameters long, an increment of no less
than 100 per cent. Thus the magnetic properties of steel can be modified to an
extraordinary degree by the simple operation of cold drawing through successive
holes.

7. Nevertheless, considerable skill and judgment are required in conducting the
operation of drawing, if the peculiar qualities which piano wire possesses are to be
developed in the highest degree. One fact in connection with the process of
manufacture, which may be mentioned here because of its physical interest, is that
a wire after drawing through one hole draws more satisfactorily through the next if
given a period of rest between the operations, and the longer the period of rest,
extending even to many weeks, the more satisfactory is the subsequent drawing. {
