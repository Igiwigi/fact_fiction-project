Fortunately, however, there is another test by which the resistance may be
examined, a test altogether independent of the action of light or heat. This is the
rate at which the mill comes to rest when the light is turned off, If the pivot were
the only source of resistance the time required for the mill to come to rest would be as
the speed; that is to say, if it required 15 seconds for the mill to come to rest when
making 10 revolutions per minute, it would require 150 seconds to come to rest from
100 turns per minute. In fact, however, my mill, which requires 15 seconds to come
to rest from 10 revolutions, does not take 30 to come to rest from 100 revolutions. In these experiments the wheel was set in motion by turning the envelope, and not by
the aid of light or heat. We have, therefore, conclusive evidence that the resistance
is not merely that of the pivot (which, in fact, is 80 small as to be inappreciable); and
the only other resistance of which we know*Â® is that of the air.
