Jeffrey Lees 1. Introduction

e-mail: jeffrey.m.lees@gmall.com Concerns about political polarization and its negative effects on democracy and

intergroup relations have increased among scholars, policy makers and the
public alike over the past few years [1-4]. Yet despite this attention to polariz-
ation as a major contributor to modern political ills, a growing body of scientific
work on ‘false polarization’ has simultaneously flourished, suggesting that the
extent of polarization is largely a fiction of our minds [5-8]. So are we actually quite polarized or do we just think we are? The answer,
ultimately, is it depends.
