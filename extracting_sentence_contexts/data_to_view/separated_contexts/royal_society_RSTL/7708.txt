To yerify the equations of the line 12. 3'4', observe that the two equations give
Z Z4IW=nJX(P-+7) —Y(2+24 14]
Z HW =X(prt gn) Y(phetets)þ

v3 FT7 FLY).
- ZW =|pfe (X—EFEY(X—£FEY):

— the equation of the surface, multiplying by X and observing that —y3=af fff,
V becomes

E XZW +XY(/Z4+3W)Y'— Tn (X—f,Y)(KX—fY)(X—f,Y)(X—f,Y)=0;

A and substituting the values just obtained, this is
X(X—f+EY)(X—fFEY)+XY(XEEFEE—YEEETEEE EEE EET, )
+AEEEEV*—(X—fY)(X—fY)(X—f,Y)(X—f,Y)=0,
which is in fact an identity. T7. The facultative lines are the transversal and the six mere lines 5 -F=p=07; f=8.
