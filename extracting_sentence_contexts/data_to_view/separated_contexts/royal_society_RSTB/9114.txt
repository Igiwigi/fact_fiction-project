The manifestly low social rhesus mon-
keys thus best paralleled the loneliest human group. These
were animals that had high frequencies of ‘tentative’ social
behaviours, such as approaching or walking by another
animal, but low frequencies of ‘complex’ social behaviours
like maintaining proximity and contact, or engaging in
social grooming. In fact, these ‘lonely’ rhesus monkeys had
frequencies of ‘tentative’ behaviours that were as high as
those seen among high-sociable animals, but their levels of
‘complex’ behaviour were as low as those seen in the ‘truly
low sociable’ animals. In short, the manifestly low-sociable
(putatively lonely) animals had a mismatch between their pre-
sumed social interest (as manifested in their high levels of
behaviours that would initiate social interaction) and their
social attainment (as indicated by lower levels of proximity,
contact and grooming). In comparison to the truly low-sociable
(putatively introverted) monkeys, the behaviour of these
‘lonely’ animals, in more formalized behavioural tests,
confirmed their greater social interest.
