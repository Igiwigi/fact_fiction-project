Let us denote by A and B, fig. 4, the margin of the membrane, corresponding respec-
tively to c =0 and co =1, and let M be a general point. Then since p= P at A,
integration of (67) gives

The value of the constant ( is given by the boundary condition p = P at B; we have

If the membrane forms a closed cylinder, so that there is no margin, instead of two
boundary conditions we have only one, corresponding to the fact that p is single-valued.
The pressure p is again given by (68), but now P is an undetermined constant, while
