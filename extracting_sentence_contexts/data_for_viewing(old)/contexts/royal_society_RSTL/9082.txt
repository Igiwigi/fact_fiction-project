« Thero does nob seem to be a single bone in the skeleton of Pezophaps 8olitarig which is not

yariation is nob at all confined to absolute 8ize ; it extends to the relative proportion of divers
parts of the bone, to processes or depressions upon them snch as are commonly held to be
gpecifically characteristie, s0 that ib is often utterly impoxsible to predicate any definite limits of
individual modification.”

We are not aware that, the osteology of any vertebrate, other than man, has been
died with the same wealth of materials as that of the Solitaire. About the won-

G@rful yariability of this particular species no doubt can exist. The bearings of
tHis fact on the theory of Eyolution will not here be entered into; but that they

of necessity prove to be most important in future diseussions of that theory,
ad of many of the questions arising from it, can hardly fail to he admitted. We
kgyve deviated 80 far from the example set in the former Memoir as in certain
ofises to give precise measurements of certain bones ; but it must especially he horne
is mind that variations in length, breadth, and thickness form but a comparatively
zimaterial portion of the variations which exist, These are often, nay almost
ays, of a kind which cannot possibly be expressed in words, and could only be
resented by a series of figures almost equal in number to the specimens.
SThe age of these bones has not hitherto heen taken into consideration. Some of

Z>ol. Soc. 1855, p. 718) to bear traces of having heen broken by man, or by some
