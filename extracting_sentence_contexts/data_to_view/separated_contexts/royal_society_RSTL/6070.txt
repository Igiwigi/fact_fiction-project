Journ. t. 1. p. 199 (18559); the demonstration was in fact as follows, viz. writing

R*=(1+R=I)=1+7 (R—=1)+Z5" (R—1)+&e::
if we attend only to the terms involving powers of # not higher than #*, the series on the
right-hand side need only be continued up to the term involving (R—1)*, and the right
side being thus converted into a rational and integral function of R, it may be developed
in a series of powers of R (the highest power being of course R*), and the coefficients of
the several powers are finite series which-admit of summation ; this gives the required
formula. But there is an easier method; the process shows that the series on the right-
hand side, continued as above up to the term involving #, is, as regards 7, a rational and
integral function of the degree x; and by LAGRANGE'S interpolation formula, any rational
and integral function of 2 of the degree a, can be at once expressed in terms of the
values corresponding to (+1) particular values of n.
