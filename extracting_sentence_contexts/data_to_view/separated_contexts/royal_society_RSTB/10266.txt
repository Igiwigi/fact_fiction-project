Figure 2. Regulatory circuits of gene expression exerted by the trigger PDEs PdeR and Pdel of F. coli. (a) At low cellular c-di-GMP levels, PdeR inhibits DgcM and the
transcription factor MIrA by direct interaction and, as a consequence, the biofilm regulator CsgD is not expressed. The fact that PdeR also inactivates the inhibitor—i.e.
c-di-GMP—of its own inhibitory action on DgcM/MIrA, sets up a positive feedback loop that stabilizes the inhibition of DgcM/MIrA by PdeR (i.e. the (sgo™ state). When c-di-GMP levels increase (e.g. during entry into stationary phase when the RpoS-dependent Dgck is induced, whereas PdeH is no longer expressed and its cellular
level decreases), binding and cleavage of c-di-GMP by PdeR releases DgcM and MIrA. This allows DgcM to act as a direct co-activator for MIrA in the transcriptional
activation of the csgDEFG operon and to also produce c-di-GMP (representing a positive feedback loop that stabilizes the (sgd™ state) [30].
