Ablation of one Hemisphere.

= To test localisation in principle Goxrzt has in the Dog removed large proportions of
fe brain, and recently§ succeeded in completing the ablation of one hemisphere.
gThe animal under these circumstances could walk, run, and use the limbs in all
agtomatic movements of feeding, &c., there being no obvious persistent hemiplegia as
ig Monkeys and Men. For many ts however, there is in the Carnivora marked
hemiplegia of the opposite side - the lesion (all authors), and according to Hitzie
the loss of the “‘ muscular sense” is permanent in these animals. This fact, as well as
the concomitant persistence of anesthesia to moderate tactile impressions, is also
cfpfirmed by the observations of Scuirr, and one of us (V. H.).

-2SEMoN and Horstey|| found that in all animals examined after removal of one
kigmisphere the “automatic” ¢.e., respiratory, movements of the vocal cords were

BBrfectly bilateral.

é Ablation of the “ Motor” Area of one Hemisphere, followed by Ablation of that of
> the Opposite Side,

3 Carvinie and Durer‘! investigated the matter by removing one so-called motor
a#ea, and observing the paresis caused thereby, noting that the paresis gradually dis-
appeared as if by substitution on the part of the opposite sound hemisphere. Removal of this latter, however, did not reproduce the paresis of the limbs on the
aqme side,
