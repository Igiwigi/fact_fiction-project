S The indigo test, as recently refined by Bouss1x6AaULTÂ®, and the protosulphate-of-iron
ztest, were both employed. When nitric acid was sought for and not found, if practicable

&the negative result was always confirmed by the addition to some of the substance under

Dexamination of a quantity of nitric acid (in the form of nitrate) less than could affect

Sany conclusions to be drawn from the fact of its presence or absence in the substance in
Squestion. In all the cases of such addition the re-examination showed the presence of

Anitric acid. The method of Bovss1SGAULT was much more delicate than the protosulphate-of-iron
test; but, on the other hand, the latter was much less liable to give deceptive indica-
tions, dependent on other circumstances than the presence of nitric acid.
