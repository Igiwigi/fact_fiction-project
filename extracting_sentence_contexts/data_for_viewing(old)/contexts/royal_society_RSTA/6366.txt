A proposition is a formula of the form P(t,...,tn), where te CUY for 1 <j <n, ie. there are 3
no compound terms. Let R € P and Q; € P for 0 <i< min T. Datalog clauses are of the four types 1S

in definition 2.2, R is called the head of the clause and the conjunction of the Q;s forms the body.

Definition 2.2. Kowalski Form Horn clauses

Implication: (Q) A... A Qm) => R, where m > 0. These usually represent the rules of T.

Assertion: => R, ie. the body is empty. When R contains no variables the assertion is called
ground. These ground assertions represent the facts of T and the members of T(PS) and
F(PS).

Goals: Qi A...A Qm =>, i.e. the head is empty. These usually arise from the negation of the
conjecture to be proved and from subsequent subgoals in a derivation.

Empty Clause: =>, i.e. both the head and body are empty. This represents false, which is [2
the target of a reductio ad absurdum proof. Deriving it, therefore, represents success in :
proving a conjecture. 78
