Precmomnary Remarks. Introduction. Statistics applied to the subject-matter of different sciences are merely a method :
but statistics exist also as an independent science, the contents of which represent
the demological facts obtained by application of the statistical method. The two branches of demological science, that is, statistics of natality and of
mortality, are, both of them, sprung from the soil of England. It was in 1665 that
the Royal Society, by publishing the ‘ Natural and Political Observations,’ written by
Captain Joun Graunt three years before, laid the foundation stone of that science
which, under the name of Vital Statistics, or Demology (Demography), forms the
scientific nucleus of statistical researches,

When Graunt published, 230 years ago, the outlines of ide. science, he could not
foresee the great extension which it would take, especially in consequence of the
establishment of special offices for the collection of statistics.
