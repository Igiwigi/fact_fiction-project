thicker than those of the lower deposit of Jaksi Klich. From the latter they differ
also in not being highly coloured and in having the beaks fairly developed, though
diminished relatively to those of normal Aral shells. As will be shown hereafter, they

— closely resemble those shells which were found on the shore of the lagoon Abu
& Kir, i in Egypt ; the length of these shells is as great in proportion to their lieeedil as
Bit is in those of the fourth or fifth terrace at Shumish Kul. The average ratio of
5 length to breadth in 30 shells varying in length between 22 mm. and 17 mm. is
8 §1:0°740; that is to say, that the average breadth of a shell 20 mm. long is 14°8 mm.
@ Many examples of Hydrobia ulve were found amongst these modified shells, but
S they do not differ from those of the Aral Sea.
‘b In attempting to realise the conditions under which the Cockles lived in Jaksi Klich
before the separation of this series of lakes from the Aral Sea, the fact of its situation
= must be berne in mind. It was a large lagoon, ten miles long and three miles broad,
= a Vey shallow, and connected with the main body of the Aral Sea only by a narrow
Band shallow channel at Ak Jalpas. Hence the conditions of life in it, in a climate
2 which undergoes the greatest extremes of heat and cold, must have been always very
3 different from those prevailing in Shumish Kul, which had a considerable depth, and
'S so must have maintained a much more constant temperature.
& Before, therefore, the communication between the lakes and the Aral Sea was
&. interrupted it is clear that the water of Jaksi Klich must have been sometimes very
= hot, and, from the consequent evaporation, it was probably in summer much salter than
© the nearest parts of the Aral Sea. In view then of the obvious correlation between
yg the effects of the diminution in size of Shumish Kul and the increase in the propor-
tional length and thinness, &c., of the shells found there, it appears reasonable to
