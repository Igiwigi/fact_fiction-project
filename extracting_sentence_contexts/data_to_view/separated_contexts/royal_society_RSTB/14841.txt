It was later shown that
PAD4~'~ mice are resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis in
the thymus, and the H4R3cit mark was associated with smal-
ler tumour size in non-small cell lung cancer tissues [61]. The
interplay between p53 and PAD4 in apoptosis regulation is,
therefore, intricate, and likely impacted by the type of
damage signal received. However, the hypothesis that PAD4
plays an important role in apoptosis is further supported
by the fact that maximum PAD4 enzyme activity requires
elevated calcium ion concentrations, and calcium ion influx
into cells has been implicated in regulating apoptotic signals
[62,63]. Since other PADs have not been shown to interact
with p53, PAD4-mediated citrullination may play a unique
role in p53-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, a role for PAD4 in transcriptional activation
has also been reported.
