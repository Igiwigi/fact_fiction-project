The question now presents itself, whether there is any distinction between the
0 types into which MacCuxtacs divides possible energy-functions of this kind,
hich will enable us to reject the one that modifies the form of the wave-surface. It
Weems fair to lay stress on the circumstance that the first of MacCuttacn’s types of
persional energy may represent an interaction between the average strain of the
ium (f, g, h) and the average disturbance of the strain due to molecular
iscreteness, while the other form represents the energy of some type of disturbance
f the strain which combines only with itself, and is not directly operative on the
ia strain. It would seem natural to infer that a term of the second type would
Gave its coefficient of a higher order of small quantities than the ones we are now
guvestigating.
@ For the most general case of seolotropy, the dispersional energy W. must be either
“® quadratic function of first differential coefficients of (f, g, h), or else a lineo-linear
‘unction of ( f, g, h) and its second differential coefficients, If the first alternative be
‘Gejected for the reason just given, there remains a form of which MacCutiacu’s is
the special case in which the second differential coefficients group themselves into the
rator V2, A reason for this restriction is not obvious, unless we may take the
already determined for an isotropic medium as showing that the dispersion
wrises from the interaction of (/, g, h) on V? (f, 9, 4); such a restriction is in fact
Alemonstrable when we bear in mind the scalar character of the energy-function. The Influence of Dispersion on Reflexion.
