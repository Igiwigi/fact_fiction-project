acclimation in the SMR of amphibians also agree with the
natural pattern of variation in T,. That is, acclimatization
responses in oxygen consumption to changes in Ta are
more common in temperate species—which usually experi-
ence large thermal fluctuations in their habitats—than in
tropical species—which usually experience small thermal
fluctuations in their habitats [43-46]. Overall, these results
suggest that SMR of amphibians has been shaped by climatic
factors, through natural selection (but see [47,48]).

The role of spatial patterns in other compensatory mech-
anisms, like adjustments in thermal sensitivity of metabolic
rates, nevertheless has received much less attention. In fact,
an early debate that took place between authors who claimed
that Qio-smr was independent of latitude [36,37,49] and
authors suggesting that tropical ectotherms tend to have
higher Qio.smr than temperate species [50-52] was aban-
doned unsolved. Thus, in the present study, we have
advanced on previous knowledge on this topic by showing
that the relationship between Qiosmr and latitude changes
with the thermal range over which Qio-smr is assessed, as
expected from the ‘metabolic homeostasis’ hypothesis
(HMM). Specifically, we found that temperate species have
higher Qio-smr than tropical species for the colder end
of the thermal range (i.e. 5-15°C and 10-20°C), while the
