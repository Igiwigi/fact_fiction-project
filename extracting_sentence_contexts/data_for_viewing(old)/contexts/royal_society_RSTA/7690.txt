Ewhere each sample is described by means of values of the characters X, Y, .. ., Z,
corresponding to each of the individuals forming the sample. The probability of
“any sample E;, say P {E,|0,, %2,... 9}, depends on a certain number, /, of para-

meters 0;, the values of which are unknown, describing the properties of the
Zpopulation x. The problem consists in determining how to use the sample which
Amay be actually obtained in order to estimate 4. ;

We see that the conditions of the problem in (ia) are expressed in terms of pro-
bability. The same holds good with regard to the problem in (ib), which shows
that the distinction between (ia) and (ib) is only superficial. In fact, random
experiments differ from those which are not considered as random only by the cir-
cumstance that the mathematical model devised for their description involves

Otherwise the method of sampling and the properties of the

ntary probability law of X, Y,..., Z considered as random
