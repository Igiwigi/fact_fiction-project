(1.) The Posterior Roots,

The simplest mode of obtaining the effects in afferent nerves is that of exposing @
posterior root, dividing it near the ganglion and connecting its cut central end and

the surface immediately above with the galvanometer circuit in the manner described.
The objections to this experiment consist in the great shock to the animal which the
necessarily prolonged exposure of the roots necessitated by the procedure seems to
sause, and in the fact that the posterior root does not hold out as long as the sciatic
nerve, its excitability being more readily influenced by falling temperature, drying, &c.

We have however succeeded in three different animals (Cat) in obtaining a series
f readings of the value of the root effect, the details of the experiments being as
‘ollows :—

Tn all three animals, the left 7th lumbar posterior root was selected, this being
ie largest of the posterior roots in the Cat which receives afferent fibres from the
Gatic nerve, as shown in the accompanying reproduction of a photograph of the

Hecus. (See fig. 18.)
