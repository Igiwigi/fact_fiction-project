The number of ionized
L,-levels is effectively reduced by the transition L, > L, with the emission of an Auger
electron. It is worth noting that in this case, unlike the case of L, > /,, there can
be no question of the emission of radiation, since the radiative transition 2p; > 2/,
is absolutely forbidden. The observed fact that the filling of the L,-level from the
L,-level is much less probable than that of the L,-level is perhaps connected with this
selection rule. * Unfortunately, Johnston was induced, by our mistaken interpretation of the Z satellite bands

as L,-bands, to interpret his results in accordance with this hypothesis, and to look for sharp L,-absorption
edges, + See the third paper of this series (Bullen, Johnston and Skinner). Vol. 239.
