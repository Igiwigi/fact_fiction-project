In view of the
various uncertainties it has not been thought profitable to try to define the relationship
more closely. On general grounds it does not seem likely that increase in the number
of muscle fibres innervated would necessitate increase in the size of the nerve fibres. The initial part of the axons of the second-order fibres is very much thinner than the
main trunk, a fact which by itself suggests that the significance of the large diameter
is that it ensures rapid conduction, and not that it provides for the maintenance of
the large mass of tissue which the fibre must innervate. In any case the large fibre
g.f.2a does not have to control large numbers of muscle fibres but only the relatively
few third-order giant-nerve fibres.

11. CLARIFICATIONS OF THE NEURON THEORY

The peculiar opportunities offered by the giant-fibre system of cephalopods enable
us to formulate a number of important propositions about the organization of the
nervous system, amplifying and clarifying the neuron theory.
