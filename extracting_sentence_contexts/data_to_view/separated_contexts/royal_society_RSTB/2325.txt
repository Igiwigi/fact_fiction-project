188 DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE “BLAZE CURRENTS”

The nature of an exciting current, and its strength, influence the result, which in
any given case is the algebraic sum of blaze current and of polarisation current. The
observations of Du Bors-REyMoND on positive polarisation of muscle, nerve, and
electrical organ, those of Hermann and Hertne on the post-anodic action currents
of muscle and nerve, were systematically made with the constant current, by which
the polarisation factor is elicited in highest degree. By reason of this fact the after-
currents observed were very generally diphasic, first negative, then positive, duration
of current being favourable to the manifestation of the negative factor, strength ot
current to that of the positive factor. Thus, on muscle, pu Bots-Reymonp obtained,
e.g., negative maximum after 10 minutes closure of the current from 1 Grove cell,
and positive maximum after 0:075 second closure of the current from 20 Grove cells. He incidentally mentions the fact that he obtained pure positive effects by sufficiently
strong break induction shocks both upon muscle and upon nerve.
