Dr. F1xer's paper clearly shows that he made the fundamental
observation in the case of Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata quite independently of
my suggestion in © Nature;* and Dr. Lifzxex's reference to this paper has been of special
value to me from the fact that up to the time when T received it (viz. February 1876)
no one in England appears to have been aware that Dr. Enter had done any work in
connexion with the neryous system of Meduse. This ignorance is to be accounted
for by the fact that the journal in which Dr. Encer published his paper has but a very
limited circulation in this country, while of the paper itself no abstract appears in the
© Centralblatt.” The following is a full abstract of the results and opinions set forth by the paper in
question. In Aurelia aurita the author observed that excision of the lithocysts was usually
followed by complete and permanent paralysis of the swimming-organ, while any tissue
left adhering to a lithocyst continued rhythmically to contract © like the excised heart
of a frog.”
