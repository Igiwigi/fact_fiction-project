Assisted by the introductions of Davip LizTcn, Esq., M.D., and by the local
knowledge of Jamzs Maruzr, Esq., I had little difficulty in fixing on a mine. The
deepest mines in the Durham coal-field are near the coast. The deepest of all is the
Monk Wearmonth Colliery ; but it is 80 close to the sea (its workings in fact extending
far under the ea), that it seemed probable that more of disadvantage would be intro-
duced by the complication of the elements of final computations than of advantage
by its extreme depth. The next in depth, I believe, is the Harton Pit, at the distance
of s0mewhat more than two miles from South Shields, and about the same distance
from the coast. The general circumstances of form of surface, &c. are as favourable
as can usnally be found.
