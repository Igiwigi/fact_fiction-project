Societies with strong social norms are, for instance, better able to informally coordinate behaviour
under collective threats, like climate change and pandemics [8,16]. While social norms have long been of interest to scientists of a wide variety of disciplines,
empirical evidence of the causal relationship between a norm and behaviour is rare. In fact,
most social norm research takes the effect of social norms for granted and uses norms as a post
hoc interpretation of observed phenomena [25]. Being outcome-oriented, it seeks to answer the
question ‘Does intervention X change behaviour Y’? While this allows for a rapid transfer of
research to policy and implementation, this approach strongly hinders generalizing the effect
that an intervention has in changing a behaviour, because the way in which the intervention
works is largely left unexamined.
