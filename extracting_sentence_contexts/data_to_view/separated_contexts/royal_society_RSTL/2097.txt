These, as well as the index corrections
determined by the collimator, are aftected with the errors of
division. It may $erve for illustrating the importance of the floating
collimator, to consider that it furnishes the observer with. a
fixed star, which he can place in his horizon (in fact at any
given. altitude), unaffected by refraction, visible at any instant,
and on which he can make his observations in a closed room. That this fictitious star can be observed with. as great exact-

doing it not imparted at the same time, astronomers would
have received it as one of the most important discoveries of
modern times in this science, and anxiously expected its
details. What I have adduced in these tables of observations, will,
I hope, assist in enabling others to appreciate the value of
this new astronomical power, which, unless I deceive myself,
may be considered as even belonging to a future more ad-
yanced state of practical astronomy. Explanation of, and remarks on Table 1.

'The index corrections used in obtaining these results were
found by the collimator.
