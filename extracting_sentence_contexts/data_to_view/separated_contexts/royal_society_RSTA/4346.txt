The largest wires used in establishing the above formule were 14 millims. It is
therefore not surprising if, after extrapolating for a wire over three times this
diameter, the calculated and experimental values differ considerably. This diver-
gence is also in some degree accounted for by the fact that the enclosures used
in the two cases were of an entirely different shape and size. In a paper recently published, Mr. C. F. Bruss gives a number of observations
“on the transmission of heat by gases,” at temperatures of from 0° to 15° C.
Unfortunately it is impossible to reduce these to absolute units. The relative
value of the emissivity in air and in hydrogen is much the same as that which may
be deduced at some hundred degrees higher from fig.
