It would be an immense advantage if we could accept such a theory of the pure
gamete as has been here analysed as a physiological basis for the theory of heredity. We should then have a physiological origin for the ideas of regression and of ancestral
inheritance which statistics of heredity in populations have made familiar to
biometric workers. Unfortunately, even such a general pure gamete theory as we
have here dealt with, while leading to results which form a special case of the law of
ancestral heredity, is not sufficiently elastic to cover the observed facts. The lesson

to be learnt from the present investigation is, however, that there is no essential
repugnance between any of the main results of the biometric school and a theory of
the pure gamete, but, on the contrary, it is perfectly possible to test such theories by
biometric methods.
