It was proved in [30] that the mapping > /i has a unique fixed point if 0 <t <T, which yields
the solution asserted in theorem 3.2. The extension of the solution to all times remains a difficult open problem, so here we
formulate a much simpler one. Consider the cylindrically symmetric case, so that

(x,y,z, =P(r,z,b), r= (x7 + yy,

and, in fact, take
g(r,z,t) = Z(r,t) — z. Then the free boundary moves according to the equation

Zt + vZ; — v3 =0,

where v = (v, v3), and v is the radial velocity. Consider the elliptic system (3.8)-(3.11) with P a : =
given function of (r,t).
