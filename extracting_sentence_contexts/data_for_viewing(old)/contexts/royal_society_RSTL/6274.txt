from the absorption of the hyponitric acid gas. On continuing to pass sparks till the
decompoxition was finished, and waiting till the hyponitric acid gas was completely
absorbed, the residue amounted to a little more than one-fourth of the original gas.
This residue consisted of a mixture of 11 vols. nitrogen and 1 vol. oxygen. It is evident
that the final result is a little complicated, but there can be little doubt that the action
of the spark is to convert 8 vols. of deutoxide of nitrogen into 4 vols. of hyponitric acid
gas, and 2 vols. of nitrogen. This decomposition may be due to the immediate action
of the discharge; or the deutoxide of nitrogen may, in the first instance, be resolyed
into equal volumes of nitrogen and oxygen, the latter combining as it is formed with
undecomposed deutoxide.

Carbonic Oxide has given results of great interest, the investigation of which has already
occupied a considerable time, although it is not yet completed. The principal facts
have, however, been already ascertained, and as they present some remarkable analogies
to those already described in the case of oxygen, we shall briefly allude to them here,
reserving the complete investigation for a future communication.

The carbonic oxide was prepared by heating oxalic acid with an excess of sulphuric
acid, and absorbing the carbonic acid by means of a strong solution of hydrate of potash.
The gas, as it escaped from the end of the apparatus, did not produce the slightest
turbidity im lime or baryta water, and was completely absorbed by an ammoniacal solu-
tion of the subchloride of copper.

On exposing this gas to the action of the silent discharge, a' steady contraction took
place, and the surface of the positive platina wire became covered with a continuous
