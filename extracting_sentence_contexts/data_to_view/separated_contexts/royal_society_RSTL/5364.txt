This corollary is the geometrical expression of the law of the maximum efficiency
of a perfect thermo-dynamic engine, already investigated by other methods. In fact,
the area MABN represents the whole heat expended, or the latent heat of expansion,
the actual heat at which heat is received being Q, ; MDCN, the heat lost, or the
latent heat of compression, which is carried off by conduction at the actual heat Q, ;
and ABCD (being the indicator-diagram of such an engine), the motive power, pro-
duced by the permanent disappearance of an equivalent quantity of heat; and the
efficiency of the engine is expressed by the ratio of the heat converted into motive
power to the whole heat expended, viz.—

(10.) Third Corollary (of Thermo-Dynamic Functions). If the two curves of no transmission in fig. 6, ADM, BCN, be indefinitely close
together, the ratio of the heat consumed in passing from one of those curves to the
other, to the actual heat present, will be the same, whatever may be the form and
position of the curve indicating the mode of variation of pressure and volume, provided
it intersects the two curves of no transmission at a finite angle; because the area
contained between this connecting curve and the two indefinitely-prolonged curves
