That is to ay, after the
discontinuance of the dung, the greater growth of grasses with, than without, the
ammonia-salts is chiefly due to a greater prominence, and a greater luxuriance, of the
poorer species, Agrostis vulgaris, Holcus lanatus, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Festuca
ovnd. Whilst, without the ammonia-salts, Leguminose greatly increased in prominence,
Sith them the quantity remained 80 8mall that the deficiency compared with plob 2
Ancreased from year to year, the result being mainly due to the relatively deficient
growth of Lathyrus pratensts.
=> Of total Miscellaneze, with a great relative deficiency on plot 1 in the first separation-

ear, there was subsequently even a slight excess. This was in fact exclusively due
Fo the very much greater growth of Rumer Acetoss. Indeed, almost all the other
Mniscellaneous species show either an average or an increasing relative deficiency with
he ammonia-salts ; the most marked decline, compared with plot 2, being in Plantago
Be. Achillea Millefolium, and Ranunculus repens and 2. bulbosus.
