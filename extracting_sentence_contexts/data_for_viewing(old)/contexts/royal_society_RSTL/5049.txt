provisions, destined s00n to be replaced by those permanent elements by which the
blood of the perfect animal is afterwards to be distinguished.

When the embryo of the articulated animal firs: emerges from the ovum, it is
virtually an Annelid in outward form and internal structure. The system of the
nutrient fluids, and the fluids themselves, fall obviously under the character of the
chylaqueous type. The perfect absence of independent conduits circumscribing a
highly organized fluid, reduces the larva of the Insect to the low standard of the em-
bryo Annelid. Here then is an unequivocal demonstration of the proposition that
the articulated series are directly continuous with the annulose through the medium
of the fluids ; that the chylaqueous system is traceable from the latter into the former ;
that which is persistent in the Annelid is temporary only in the articulated animal,
These generalizations are founded upon faithfully observed facts, the value of which
in philosophical zoology cannot be exaggerated. In relation to the nutritive fluids
of the articulated series, it is proposed now that we proceed to the establishment of
the following propositions :â€”lst, that in the embryonic condition of the Myriapoda,
Insecta, Arachnida and Crustacea, the fluids, in composition and plan of circulation,
fall under the designation of the chylaqueous system which persistently prevails in
all classes below the Articulata; 2nd, that although in the articulated animal the
chylaqueous fluid and the blood-proper have in no instance a contemporaneous
existence in the same individual, yet that these two orders of fluid are marked by
such strikingly diverse physical characters that their distinctness and independence
cannot be doubted; 3rd, that the corpuscles contained in the embryonic or chyl-
aqueous fluid of the Articulata present varieties in form, structure and size, far
different from and more numerous than those which occur in the corpuscles of the
