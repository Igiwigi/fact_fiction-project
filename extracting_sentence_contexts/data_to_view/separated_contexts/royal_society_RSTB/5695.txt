30 BL SAHNI: STRUCTURE OF ZYGOPTERIS PRIMARIA (COTTA) AND ON RELATIONS

leaf-bases revealed all the stages, hitherto
unknown, in the leaf-trace sequence, while
the outermost petioles were identical in
structure with those of the type-specimen,
leaving no doubt whatever of a specific
identity. Between the petioles were nu-
merous adventitious roots. also previously
unknown. While this improved acquaintance with
one of the first-known Zygopterids is
welcome in itself, the facts now brought
to light are of a very unexpected nature. For, as I have ascertained beyond doubt.
and as will be seen from what follows, Z.

upon a stem having the Botrychioxylon type
of stele; the leaf-trace sequence and root-
structure were also essentially as in B.
