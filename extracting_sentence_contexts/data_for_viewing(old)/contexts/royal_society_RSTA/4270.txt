the present state of the theory [48] or from more recent assessments, although QED continues to El
add new technical findings. According to Pais:

Is there a theoretical framework for describing how particles are made and how they [a
vanish? There is: quantum field theory. It is a language, a technique, for calculating the : g
probabilities of creation, annihilation, scattering of all sorts of particles: photons, electrons, :Z
positrons, protons, mesons, others, by methods which to date invariably have the characters : 2

of successful approximations. No rigorous expression for the probability of any of the
above-mentioned processes has ever been obtained. The same is true for the corrections,
demanded by quantum field theory, for the positions of energy levels of bound-state :
systems [e.g. atoms]. There is still a [Schrédinger] equation for the hydrogen atom, but atta}
it is no longer exactly soluble in quantum field theory. In fact, in a sense to be described :&
[ie. the sense explained above], the hydrogen atom can no longer be considered to consist 3
of just one proton [or three quarks plus gluons in the nucleus] and one electron. Rather it [=
contains infinitely many particles. ([49], p. 325)

Pais’s added comment is also still valid: nee)

In quantum field theory the postulates of special relativity and of quantum mechanics are Dw
taken over unaltered, and brought to a synthesis which perhaps is not yet perfect but which :
indubitably constitutes a definitive step forward. It is also a theory which so far has not :3
yielded to attempts at unifying the axioms of general relativity with those of quantum [8
mechanics. Is quantum field theory the ultimate framework for understanding the structure 7‘
of matter and the description of elementary processes? Perhaps, perhaps not. ([49], p. 325)
