the value given by the original PLANcK theory for an oscillator with two degrees of
freedom. He then arrives at a formula which reproduces quite well the observations
on platinum, the anhydrous and hydrated manganese sulphates, hydrated ferrous
sulphate, anhydrous ferric sulphate, and liquid oxygen-nitrogen mixtures. It must be
observed, however, that the method of the introduction of the quantum theory is not
very satisfactory theoretically, and that the theory does not explain the newer types of
deviation from the Wess law at low temperatures.

In reviewing the present position of the theory of paramagnetism, it may be said that
no satisfactory quantitative theory embracing all the known facts exists at present.
Thus, though Foiix’s theory explains the existence of the various types of deviation, it is
in no wise quantitative, while the quantitative theories such as that of RercuE, which may
be considered as fairly satisfactory theoretically, give no explanation of the other types
of deviations from’ the Wetss law than that known as the “‘ cryomagnetic anomaly.”

Part IJ.—MEASUREMENTS OF THE PRINCIPAL SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF CRYSTALS.

Very few instances of trustworthy quantitative measurements of the magnetic
properties of crystals are to be found in the literature and still fewer data on the tempera-
ture dependence of the principal stisceptibilities. The first reliable measurements of the
principal susceptibilities of crystals are those of VoraT and Krvosuita,* who investigated
a large number of minerals at atmospheric temperature. Their work was later extended
