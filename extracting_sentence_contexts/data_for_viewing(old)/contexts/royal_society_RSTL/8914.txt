tions. And not only s0, but by removing, with the aid of a well-pointed scissors, the
little sac of crystals composing the central part of the lithocyst, without injuring the
curious wing-like appendages by which this sac is partly surrounded, and, conversely,
by removing in other specimens these wing-like appendages alone, without injuring the
little sac of crystals—by these experiments I was able to satisfy myself that the whole
spontaneity of the lithocyst appeared to be exclusively lodged in the minute sac of
crystals referred to.

There is thus in this particular a direct contradiction between the results of Dr.
Enr's experiments and those of my own. I should therefore like to state that my
experiments with reference to this subject were not made till near the end of the
season, and $0 at a time when the only specimens I could procure were small and not
very active. In view of this fact I intended to defer publishing any account of the
experiments now detailed until I had an opportunity of confirming them on vigorous
Specimens; but a perusal of Dr. Erun's statements appears to render it desirable for
me to give an opinion now upon the point under consideration, although I confess
that, for the reason just mentioned, I do 80 with some diffidence.

I fully agree with Dr. Een in his view that the contractions of Aurelia aurita are
« uxnally involuntary,” but that they are nevertheless to a certain extent subject to
the control of volition. As stated in the beginning of this paper, I believe that
different species of Medusz are endowed in different degrees with the power of
volition ; and in this respect I should place Aurelia aurita at the head of all the covered-
eyed species T have observed : its contractions are not of s0 purely 7hythmical a nature
as are those of Cyancea capillata, &c.
