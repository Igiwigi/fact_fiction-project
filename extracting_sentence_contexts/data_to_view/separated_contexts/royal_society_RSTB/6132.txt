to take another enormous meal ; the weight curve therefore fluctuates very rapidly
and widely, fig. 4. The facts given in Table XIV show some of the inherent
difficulties of the problem ; it gives wet and dry weights of Glossina tachinoides killed
four hours after feeding, flies which refused to feed having been excluded. If the
maxima and minima are compared, for either sex, and for wet or dry weights, the
ratio is almost two to one. The same thing is more appropriately measured by the
coefficients of variation which are about twice as great as in unfed flies, Tables IX,
X, and XI.
