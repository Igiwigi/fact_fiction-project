the concept of optimization: decision-makers optimally complex decisions, how they adapt to varying levels of


computational complexity and how resources are allocated to
decision-making.

More accurate theories of decision-making are desirable not
only from a scientific perspective but also from the perspective
of public policy, including regulation. In some domains such as
financial markets, regulation of goods and services is premised
on rational-actor models. That is, consumers are assumed to
make rational choices in the sense of Savageâ€”despite the fact
many decisions consumers face have high degrees of compu-
tational complexity. Those decisions include savings and
investment decisions or the selection of insurance contracts.

In the light of the evidence presented in this article, this
assumption is clearly implausible. Computationally (and bio-
logically) plausible models of decision-making will improve
the design of products, services and markets as well as their
regulation, with the potential for substantial gains in welfare.
