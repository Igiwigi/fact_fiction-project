branch and being out of focus cannot be seen in the figure. In this branch also there
is no evidence of spines either on the outer margin or on the exposed surface. The
spines are restricted in this specimen to these two small ultimate divisions of the
branch-system. Further they appear to have been developed only on the inner
slightly concave margins of the small curved axes. The latter are closely similar to
the isolated curved axis (fig. 41, Plate 11) described above, and it is probable that
they were identical structures. In all the specimens the spines appear to be restricted
to the inner margin of small branches. This is a peculiar and hitherto undescribed
character. The fact that the same character has been repeated in three separate
examples strengthens the probability that the localization of the spines is a natural
feature.

(n) Stems with small, spirally arranged elevations, figs. 43, 44, 45

Among the fragmentary axes of medium size at Mt. Pleasant are numerous
examples with small elevations on their surfaces. In the counterparts these appear
as depressions. The specimens include stems of from 2-15 mm in width, but the
majority are about 3 mm broad. The elevations are round or oval in form ; their
range in length is from 0-2-0-7 mm and their long axes are parallel to the length of
the stem. Frequently, as in fig. 43, Plate 11, the elevations are extremely numerous
and closely arranged, in others, as for example in fig. 44, Plate 11, they are more
