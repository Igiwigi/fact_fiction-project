Each sterile whorl consisted of about twelve; coherent bracts, forming a |

The bracts of successive sterile whorls, as already indicated, alternate
another, so that the free extremities of the bracts of any verticil pass be
of the verticil next above. This is easily seen in tranverse sections of th

The cohesion of the bracts serves to distinguish C. Binneyana from the
