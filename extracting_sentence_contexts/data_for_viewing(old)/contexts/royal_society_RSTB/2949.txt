composite structures, the outer third of which is constituted by the filament proper
and the inner two-thirds by the interlamellar extension. A further means of dis
tinguishing the filament proper in such cases as this is the fact that the chitinous
lining is thickened in the filament proper but not in its interlamellar extension.
If the interlamellar extensions of a descending filament and its corresponding

ascending filament become united across the interlamellar space, an interlamellar
septum is formed; and in the filaments of Are granosa and Area americana
(fig. 10A, p. 199), and the principal filaments of Pecten and Spondylus, the appear-
ances are decidedly suggestive of the fact that the great flap developed on the
upper part of the descending filament has been unable to produce a high septum in
consequence of the failure on the part of the ascending filament to respond to a
sufficient degree in the same direction.

It is a significant fact that interlamellar junctions having the form of rods occur
only in those genera with feeble development of subfilamentar tissue, viz., certain
Filibranchia and Submytilacea. Pinna, it is true, is an exception, but there
is reason for believing that the three interlamellar bars to each principal filament of
this genus are the relics of a fenestrate septum (fig. 17A, p. 214).

Like so many features of gill structure this proneness of the filaments to extension
in an interlamellar direction is of little, if any, systematic value. It is possibly
