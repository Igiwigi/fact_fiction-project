And the very act of accumulation, causing an in-
draught, there will consequently be a current round the Capes :
of Finisterre, and Ortegal, towards the Bay. Be the exact
cause, however, what it may, it no doubt originates in the
Bay, by the action of strong westerly winds : the prevalence
of such winds, will therefore be the $;gnal for the appearance
of a current, between Ushant, and the south-west coast of
Ireland : for though the cause can only be guessed at, the ef-
fect is too well ascertained, to remain in doubt. I shall now adduce the facts, on which the idea of the
existence of a current is founded.

has been felt, very far within the limits of the south-east trade wind, in the Indian
Ocean,


that often prevails to the Weslward of Scilly. 18g,

In crossing the eastern part of the Atlantic, in the HeoToR
East India ship, in 1778, we encountered, between the pa-
rallels of 42 and 49, very strong westerly gales ; but particu-
larly between the 16th and 24th of January, when, at inter-
vals, it blew with uncommon violence. It varied two, or
more, points, both to the north and south of west, but blew
longest from the northern points; and it extended, as 1 after-

S wards learnt, from the coast of Nova Scotia, to that of Spain.
= We arrived within 60 or 70 leagues of the meridian of
= Scilly, on the goth of January, keeping between the parallels
= of 49 and 50: and about this time we began to feel a current,
Bb which set the ship to the north of her intended parallel, by
S near half a degree, in the interval between two observations
i= of latitude ; that is, in two days. And the wind, ever after-
2 wards, inclining to the south, would not permit us to regain
S the parallel ; for, although the northern set was trifling,
E from the g1st until we arrived very near Scilly ; yet the
E wind, being both scant and light, we could never overcome
8 the tendency of the current.
