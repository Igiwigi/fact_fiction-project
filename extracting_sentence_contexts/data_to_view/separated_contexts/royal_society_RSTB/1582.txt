Dituinished hydrostatic pressure conditions an expansion of the yolume of
gis in the nir-bladder, which will ultimately result im the transmission of a stimulus
to the sensory epithelium of the internal ear, and the initiation of aflerent impulses in
the auditory nerve. The afferent inmpalses may find their final expression im the
peristaltic contraction of the walls of the pneumatic duct and the expulsion in suo-
cessive bubbles of an amount of air that will suffice to restore equilibrium at a new
level. It is probable that the pneumatic duct is not to be regarded as a mere channel
for the escape of gas from the air-bladder, but rather as a structure which, under
reflex control, actively participates in the process, and, ab the same time, regulates
the quantity of the expelled air, Slight reductions of pressure, the result of equally
slight variations of level, may not necessarily lead to an eseape of nix, for probably no
inconveniences to the locomotion of the Fish would result from them, in fact, the
tortuosity of the pneumatic duct, aided, it may be, by a special sphincter, can be
regurded aa of the nature of a safegnard to prevent the innecessary elimination of gas
under such conditions, But more extensive reductions of pressure may ab ance call
into play the reflex mechunism to secure the necessary readjustment to the more
enperticial level. That the reflex mechanism is under the direct. control of some:

possibility that the wotivity of this centre may in tarn be dominated by some still

A little additional light may, perhaps, be thrown on the nature of the regulatory
mechanism hy some remarks of Dovosse (118), This writer describes the ductus
pueumaticus in certain Ostariophyses, such as the Carp (Cyprinus carpio), the
Barbol (C. barbatus), and the Miller's Thumb (Cobités beerbatmle, Lins.) amonz the
Cyprinids, as widening ont into a trumpet-shaped orifice as it opens into the
estplagus, and that in this dilated part of the duct the mucous membrane presents

sproduction of voluntary sounds, as Dorossi believes, if may not be altogetlier
Sunreasonable to suggest that these structures muy have something to do with
Srogulating the expulsion of gas from the air-bladder under the influence of reduced
Zhydrostatic pressure, and further that the breathing noises may only be the
"Baccidental coneomitants of the latter function, At any rate, the existence of
Salvi structures in the ductus pneumaticus of, at all events, some few Ostario-
Sphysewe affords an additional clue to the nature of the mechanism by which such

to the Fish of some such method of carefully graduated adjustment to pressure
“variations as that we lave suggested is sufficiently obvious, Without any kind of

the air-bladder as the pressure diminished, with the contingent disadvantage that the

considerable demand be made on the secretive activity of the bladder for the
Subsequent restoration of the gus. On the other hand, the existence of a controlling
meéchaniem would ensure that. only so much gas would be evolved under such
Greumstances as might suffice to maintain the Fish in a plane of least efforl, and at
