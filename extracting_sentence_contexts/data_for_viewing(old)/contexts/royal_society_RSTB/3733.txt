up to the retina of the pineal eye (fig. 3). Banpwin Spencer (1886) describes and
figures “a special group of nucleated cells (n*) which lie enclosed by a somewhat
definite membrane in the pineal stalk,” close to the junction of the left pineal nerve
with the retina. There may be a few nuclei here, probably belonging really to the
retina, but I have found no such definite group as SPENcER describes, the nerve-fibres
passing direct from the nervous layer of the retina into the nerve itself.

(2) The Right Pineal Nerve (Tractus pinealis) in the Adult——This is the tractus
pinealis of SrupyiéKxa’s terminology Gust (1907) observes :— Das Pinealorgan
sitzt an einem kurzen Gliastrang, dem Tractus pinealis, nur minim vom Gehirndach
entfernt. (An 2 Exemplaren ist der Tractus pinealis linger, die Entfernung
Gehirn—Pinealorgan deshalb auch grisser.)’* To judge from this paragraph alone,
Gist apparently did not recognise the fact that with the “ Gliastrang” an
important bundle of non-medullated nerve-fibres leaves the wall of the pineal sac.
She speaks, however, of the tractus pinealis containing a few ganglion cells, and in
another place (p. 56) she speaks of it as if it entered the habenular ganglion in
association with the left pineal nerve. i

If we apply the term tractus pinealis in a wide sense to the entire band or cord of
tissue which unites the lower extremity. of the pineal sac to the roof of the brain
(text-figs. 12, 18, 7. P.), we may say that it arises ontogenetically from the
constricted proximal portion of the pineal sac of the embryo, together with a certain
amount of pial connective tissue. As I have shown in my memoir on the development
of the pineal organs (1899,0), the pineal sac (“ parietal stalk ”) originally communicates
with the cavity of the third ventricle by an aperture which lies between the superior
