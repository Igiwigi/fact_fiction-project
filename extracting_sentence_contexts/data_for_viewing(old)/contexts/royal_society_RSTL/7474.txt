277. Reverting to the equation of the Bicorn, and considering first the form at infi-
nity, the intersections of the curve by the line infinity are given by the equation
4(24—z)=0, viz. there is a threefold intersection y*=0, and a simple intersection
24—ax=0; the equation y*=0 indicates that the intersection in question is a point of
inflexion, the tangent at the inflexion (or stationary tangent) being of course the line
infinity ; the visible effect is, however, only that the direction of the branch is ultimately
parallel to the axis of ». The equation 2y—a=0 indicates an asymptote parallel to
this line, and the equation of the asymptote is easily found to be 2y—ax+5=0.

278. 'The discussion of the equation would show that the curve has an ordinary cusp;
and a cusp of the second kind, or node-cusp, equivalent to a cusp and node; the curve
is therefore a unicursal curve, or the coordinates are expressible rationally in terms of a
parameter ©; we in fact have
