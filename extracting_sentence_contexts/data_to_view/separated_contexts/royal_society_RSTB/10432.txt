The

Here, we take a different approach, deriving simple the abundance of susceptible hosts to depend on parasite
mathematical models that incorporate host, parasite and traits rather than host traits like carrying capacity. Thus the
environmental characteristics using principles from metabolic fitness of the generalist does not depend directly on host
scaling theory [20,31]. This allows us to incorporate biologi- abundance, which can be seen from the fact that carrying
