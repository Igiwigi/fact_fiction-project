(kg are transport coefficients) which is valid near equilibrium, to the processes far from
equilibrium. The integral kernels 9(r,1’, t,t’) are non-equilibrium spatio-temporal correlation
functions of thermodynamic fluxes which introduces nonlinear, non-local and memory effects
into the system reaction. The correlation functions are nonlinear functionals of the history of
macroscopic fields all over the system volume, including boundary interaction. Macroscopic
expressions for the functionals are unknown in the general case.

The relationships (7.1) close the set of macroscopic transport equations on non-equilibrium
conditions and make equations non-local and retarding. Instead of the distribution function
the generalized equations contain more rough characteristics of non-equilibrium processes, the
integral functionals of macroscopic variables. The non-local and memory effects occur as a
payment for the inevitable incompleteness of description of non-equilibrium processes in open
system. Despite the fact that the non-local mathematical models with memory are the only
fundamentally new over the past two centuries, these results so far have not been claimed because
of the problems on the correlation functions modelling and misunderstanding of the link between
correlations and boundary conditions imposed on the system from outside.

8. New approach based on non-local theory of non-equilibrium transport
processes

Based on the non-local and retarding relationships (7.1) obtained in non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics, a new self-consistent theory of the transport processes far from equilibrium has
been developed by Khantuleva and colleagues [25,26,31,40]. The new universal approach to
the transition processes in open systems with internal structure evolution relies on the non-
local and retarding relationships (7.1) generalized to take into account the structure effects.
