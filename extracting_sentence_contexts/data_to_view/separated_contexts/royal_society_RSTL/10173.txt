MOTIONS IN A SPHERICAL CONDUCTOR. 537 In fact, if we write

w=l udr, v al var, w =þ war,

where the lower limit is taken at such a depth that the currents there are insensible,
we readily find that the currents are approximately equivalent to an infinitely thin
spherical current 8heet of radius R, the components of the current at any point of the
