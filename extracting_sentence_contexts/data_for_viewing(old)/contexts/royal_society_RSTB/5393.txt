somewhat open-textured parenchyma (Plate 8, fig. 18, a). Secondary thickening,
which occurs only in exceptional cases in the stem, is a characteristic feature of the
root. As Scorr has stated (39), a considerable amount of secondary xylem may be
developed towards the base of the root, but it is not confined to this region, and I have
observed it even in roots of relatively small diameter at some distance from the point
of origin. Two particularly fine examples of roots showing secondary thickening occur
in the Nottingham and Manchester collections respectively, and the former of these is
illustrated in fig. 18, a (Plate 8).


92 H, 8. HOLDEN ON THE STRUCTURE AND

It is a remarkable fact that the nature of the pitting of the secondary tracheids,
especially those which form the radiating series surrounding the protoxylem poles, is
quite different from that of the primary metaxylem, the pits being short and in some
cases irregular, so that a reticulate appearance results. The precise nature of the
pitting is, however, probably of physiological rather than phylogenetic interest (Plate 8,
fig. 18, b).
