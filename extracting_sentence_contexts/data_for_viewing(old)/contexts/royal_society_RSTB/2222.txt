reacted less quickly to light. The operation was undertaken for the relief of aneurism.
The arteries were degenerated and brittle, and the man died during the following
day without recovering consciousness.

Section Il.—Cerebral Anemia produced by Fixation in the Vertical Head-up
Position.

A. Recyarp* trephined the skull of two rabbits and suspended the animals in the
vertical posture, with the head up. The brain became anemic and collapsed, and in
less than two minutes convulsions supervened and the animals died.

SavaTHet proved that this rapid death only takes place when the rabbits have
lost a great deal of blood, a fact which had previously been determined by MarsHALL
Haut on dogs. Satarut, nevertheless, found that suspension, with the head up,
proved fatal to rabbits in 24 hours at the latest. Six hours’ suspension with the
head down had no effect, for the animals when liberated ran about and ate at once.
SALATHE mentions the case of a steeplejack who fell, caught his feet, and was
suspended head downwards from the cross of a church for three hours. There occurred
in this man no ill-effects. SaLarHt placed the abdomen and legs of a rabbit in an air-
chamber and lowered the pressure therein ; the blood was thus determined to these
parts, and the animal died of convulsions in a few minutes. He also centrifugalisedt
dogs and rabbits. When the feet were directed outwards the rabbits died in 6—15
minutes, and dogs in 10—25 minutes. When the head was placed outwards death
took place after a period more than twice as long.
