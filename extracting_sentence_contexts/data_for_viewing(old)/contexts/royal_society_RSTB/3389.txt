Diagram A.â€”Blood Volume of Rabbit.

There is therefore no doubt that, in the case of the mouse also, the smaller
individuals, having a relatively larger surface, contain relatively more blood than
heavier individuals having a smaller relative surface, and that owr formula B = Wilk
holds good here as well as in the case of rabbits and guinea-pigs, and represents the
experimental facts in an extremely satisfactory way, while the same facts, as we have.
insisted before, are absolutely distorted if the blood volume be expressed in the usual
manner as percentage of body weight.

Before summarising the conclusions which we have drawn concerning the blood
volumes of mammals, we wish to draw attention to a fact which is of interest from a
theoretical point of view, namely, that although our formula B= W?/k has been
proved to hold good for the calculation of the blood volume of different species of
