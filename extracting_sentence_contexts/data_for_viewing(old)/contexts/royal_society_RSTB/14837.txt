(v) Social dominance and winner-loser effects ___The terms reciprocal altruism and reciprocity were used &
In social groups, conflicts over resources like mating or in Tr71 to mean reciprocal exchanges in which individuals =

respond to a partner’s ‘cheating’ (the partner not giving &
help) by withholding help, but Tr71 also included other
forms of helping under these headings. For instance, there
is the statement that ‘Reciprocal altruism can also be
viewed as a symbiosis, each partner helping the other while
he helps himself’, with the comment that an important
characteristic of such exchanges is that there is a time lag
between an individual’s investment and the return benefit
[11, p. 39]. The non-human examples in Tr71 (cleaning mutu-
alism and warning calls) were in fact of this kind and could,
using a common terminology, be referred to as instances of
pseudo-reciprocity (investment in by-product benefits; see
below). The terminology in Tr71 might be reasonable, but it
has not prevailed. Here we use reciprocity in a strict sense,
signifying an ongoing reciprocal exchange between two indi-
viduals in which there is a potential immediate benefit of
cheating and the exchange is regulated by the withholding
of help to cheaters, in a qualitatively similar way as for the
tit-for-tat strategy. Pseudo-reciprocity is then an alternative
to reciprocity in explaining cooperation.

There was no detailed game-theory analysis in Tr71, but
