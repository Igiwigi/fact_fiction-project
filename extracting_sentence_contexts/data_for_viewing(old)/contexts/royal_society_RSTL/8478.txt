408 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE TRANSFORMATION

Observe that for the values in question y=k«, 3=kB, we have P=a(1+ke@),
Q=b(1+ka?); 80 that, writing P'=a, Q'=P, we have for y the value
1>y__(1=a)(P'—Q(a)*
1+y*(1+2)(P+Qa)”
which is the formula for a cubic transformation.

20. It is important to notice that we cannot by writing «=0 or 3=0 reduce the
transformation to a quintic one; in fact the equation F*«*=0?Z? shows that if either of
these equations is satisfied the other is also satisfied ; and we have then the foregoing
case «=0, 3=0, giving not a quintic but a cubic transformation.

And for the same reason we cannot by writing «=0, Þ=0, y=0 or B=0, y=0, 3=0
reduce the transformation to the order 1. There is thus no factor Q—1.

21. As regards the non-existence of the factor Q—1, I further verify this by writing
in the equations QN=1 ; they thus become
