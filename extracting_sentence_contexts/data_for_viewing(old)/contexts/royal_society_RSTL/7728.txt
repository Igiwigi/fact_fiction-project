inside F on the sun.

I found that a narrow slit was best for D and F, as there are bright bands in the solar
spectrum at those points. The lines were always visible with the usual width of slit.
C was bright enough to allow the slit to be widened.

On this day, as on the 20th, my attention was strongly drawn to certain bright regions
in the spectrum.

October 27.—On this date the prominence first observed was no longer on the limb,
I had to search therefore for a new one; I found one on the eastern equatorial limb.
The method of observation previously adopted was changed, and a mixed spectrum of
the swn's limb and prominence was obtained. 'The two spectra were in fact snperposed.

In the case of the line at C, the result was to absolutely eclipse the dark line in the
spectrum, and to replace it by a vividly bright band (Plate XXX VII. fig. 5). The
behaviour of the F line was still a puzzle to me. In the spectrum of the light pro-
ceeding from the exact limb of the sun the bright line was seen more refrangible than
F, but, in the spectrum of the prominence at some distance above the sun the black
line F was eclipsed (Plate XXXVIL. fig. 6). This experiment, which I repeated several
times, seemed in a measure to explain what I had before observed ; and under this date
I entered in my note-book : © It appears that away from the sun's surface the substance
gives out less refrangible light than it does when apparently at the surface.”

November 5.—The next observations were made on this date under superb atmo-
