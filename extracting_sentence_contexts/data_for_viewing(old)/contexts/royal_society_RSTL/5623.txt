78 DR. B. FRANKLAND'S RESEARCHES ON ORGANO-METATIIC BODIES.

By analogous processes, there can be little doubt that many new series of organic
acids may be derived from inorganic acids, by the replacement of one or more atoms of
oxygen by an alcohol radical; in fact, my pupil Mr. Hopsox is now studying a new
series containing sulphur, produced by the action of zincethyl and its homologues upon
sulphurous acid: the ethyl acid of this series is formed by the replacement of one
equivalent of oxygen, in three equivalents of sulphurous acid, by an alcohol radical.

The following Table exhibits the compounds of the new series of acids, which have
been described in the foregoing pages.
