The property of dual conformal symmetry is that if a colour-stripped amplitude is written in
this way, it is invariant not only under the translation x; > x; + c, but also under any conformal
transformation of the x-space. In 2008, this was shown to be valid at least up to one loop in
N=4 planar gauge theory [20]. It is of course immediate from this fact that twistor variables can
be used to render these functions manifestly dual-conformally invariant. In 2009, the concept of
momentum-twistor variables was introduced [21], to perform this function, and they have since
then been widely adopted for this purpose.

The introduction of momentum twistor variables immediately indicated a new and useful
structure governing the tree-level amplitudes for gauge theory.
