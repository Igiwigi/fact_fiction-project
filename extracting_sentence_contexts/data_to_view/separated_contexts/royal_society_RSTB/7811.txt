Moreover, striking habenular asymmetries
(indicated by unique red neurons on the left in this have been described in vertebrates that appear not
schematic). (c) Identical circuit components might exist on to possess a parapineal (e.g. amphibians), questioning

both sides of the CNS, but in different ratios. Note that these any link between asymmetry in the habenulae and
models are in no way mutually exclusive. In fact, it is likely pineal complex.

that all three strategies may be involved in the lateralization of
DDC circuitry (see the main text). Figure 4. Models for lateralization of neural tissue.
