Received: 18 June 2021 Monitor lizards (genus Varanus) are today distributed across Asia, Africa and

Australasia and represent one of the most recognizable and successful lizard
lineages. They include charismatic living species like the Komodo dragon of
Indonesia and the even larger extinct Varanus prisca (Megalania) of Australia.
One contribution of 11 to a theme issue ‘The The fossil record suggests that living varanids had their origins in a diverse
impact of Chinese paleontology on assemblage of stem (varaniform) species known from the Late Cretaceous of
China and Mongolia. However, determining the biogeographic origins of
crown-varanids has proved problematic, with Asia, Africa and Australia each
being proposed. The problem is complicated by the fragmentary nature of
Subject Areas: many attributed specimens, and the fact that the most widely accepted, and
evolution, palaeontology most complete, fossil of a stem-varanid, that of Sanizwa ensidens, is from
North America. In this paper, we describe a well-preserved skull and skeleton
of a new genus of stem-varanid from the Eocene of China. Phylogenetic
