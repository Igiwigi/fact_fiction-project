shows long-time correlations (on the order of several tp) as spatial structures that evolve in
discrete time.

While figure 2b does reveal long-time correlations as spatio-temporal structures, it is clear
that as 1 increases the structures are drifting to the right in o-space. In other words, the long-
time correlations occur over a time slightly larger than tp. This can be seen by looking at the
autocorrelation of the time series, shown in figure 2c. The autocorrelation begins to increase near
a lag of tp, but only reaches its peak at tp + 5 due to the non-instantaneous response time of the
system [21]. Therefore, 6 is related to the width of the zeroth autocorrelation peak t, as well as the
width of the first autocorrelation peak. Previous works have extensively studied this drift and its
relation to co-moving Lyapunov exponents [25,57].

The drift is a consequence of the fact that the system is causal. The delayed term x(t — tp)
cannot affect the dynamics before, or even at, the time t. Therefore, in figure 2d, we use

t=nT+o, (3.2)

to create space-time representations, where T = tp + 6 is the recurrence time and now o € [0,T].
When the space-time representation is done in this way, the structures are stabilized in space
(i.e. they have a nearly stationary average spatial position). Indeed, it has been shown that this is
often the correct moving frame in which to view the spatio-temporal behaviour of time-delayed
systems [21].
