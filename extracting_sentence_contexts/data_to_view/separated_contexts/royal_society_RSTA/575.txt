Even the
approachability of such an equilibrium in social modelling can be questioned. Thus, in principle
the social analogues of lasers based on two-level systems are possible. However, we ignore these
technicalities (which are in fact very important even in the social engineering of ASE): we want
to present just the basic scheme of amplification of coherent social information excitations.

?Impurities would contribute to decoherence of the emitted beam. That is all: we need nothing more from quantum physics. We shall now establish the
correspondence between elements of the quantum physical and the quantum-like social model.
