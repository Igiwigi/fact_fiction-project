Cultures with 4 drops showed long and thick stalks, those with 2 drops only short and
thin ones, those with a single drop still shorter ones. The distances of settlement from the
surface were: 4 drops, 1 cm.; 2 drops, 1-8 cm.; 1 drop, 3 cm. These observations can be explained by the fact that Anthophysa lives in the zone where
the lower oxide is transformed into the higher. Ferric salts are not poisonous because they
are immediately precipitated. The boundary is therefore determined by the unsuitable
conditions obtaining in the lower regions, which lack oxygen and exhibit a certain con-
centration of ferrous compounds, the two being interdependent.
