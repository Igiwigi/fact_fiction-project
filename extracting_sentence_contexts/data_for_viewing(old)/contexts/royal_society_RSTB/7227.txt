density of grids it should of course increase with their size. This is fully corroborated by the
field records. After a good deal of experimentation it was found that a simple linear fit is
fairly satisfactory. The constant term was permitted to vary from year to year, but the
coefficient of the linear term was kept the same for all three years 1939, 1940 and 1941.
In this way a graduating equation of the form

t(e) = co +0-0793(a), (249-1)
was obtained, where ¢(e) is the enumeration time in hours per grid of size (a) in acres, and
the value of the constant cj = 0°4620, 0-6826 and 0-5199 for the material collected in 1939,
1940 and 1941 respectively. From the comparatively concordant values of the constant
term it may reasonably be inferred that the graduation is fairly satisfactory.

250. The goodness of fit was tested by analysis of variance shown in table 17. In fact,
linear equations were fitted separately for the material collected in 1939, 1940 and 1941,
and obtained respectively the values 0-0661, 0-0672 and 0-1009 for the linear coefficient.
The improvement due to such separate fitting was tested, but as can be seen from table 17
was not significant. The use of a common value, namely, 0-0793, is thus fully justified.
