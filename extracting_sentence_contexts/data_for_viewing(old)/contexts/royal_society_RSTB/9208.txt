the potential to use bacterial uptake pathways as a mechanism
to actively penetrate bacterial pathogens is being explored. For
example, bacteria have complex pathways to ensure they can
sequester sufficient Fe from the host where Fe concentrations

can be as low as approximately 10~** M. Antibacterials have
been designed that are recognized by the bacterial Fe uptake
pathways and consequently hijack these systems resulting in
significantly improved penetration and thus greater antibacter-
ial activity [11]. Designing antibacterials to be recognized by
other bacterial uptake pathways will be also investigated to
understand the broader applicability of this approach. The
fact that five companies are active in TRANSLOCATION illus-
trates that rational design of compounds to optimally penetrate
bacterial cells is an industry-wide bottleneck to our delivery of
new antibacterials. Furthermore, we think more research fund-
ing needs to focus on improving our understanding of the
fundamental science that underpins the design of antibacterials
and this is also one of the recommendations in the report from
the Presidentâ€™s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology
(PCAST) on combating antibiotic resistance [12].

We also propose that we think differently about how to
address the challenges of the lead optimization process for
new antibacterials. The ENABLE consortium (also part of
