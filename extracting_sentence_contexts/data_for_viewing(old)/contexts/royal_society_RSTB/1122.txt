fibres ?) is strengthened.

Finally the region of cord investigated has some relation with the amount of the
resting difference. This is shown in Appendix B, III., in which observations made in
the dorsal region are separated from those in the lumbar region.

The average of the dorsal region = ‘029 ; highest 043, lowest ‘014.

The average of the lumbar region = ‘033 ; highest ‘04, lowest ‘028.

Although the average seems to show that the difference in the dorsal cord is
less than that in the lumbar, yet an examination of the highest and lowest limits
suggests that the preponderance, in the latter éase, is due to the fact that in the
dorsal cord several very low readings were obtained. (See Table (2); Appendix B,
TIL, Cats 194, 289, 349.)

We have endeavoured to get some notion of the relations of the different regions by
exposing in an anesthetised animal (Cat 36) the whole cord. This was then divided
into three equal lengths, comprising the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions respec-
tively, and the three placed in a warm moist chamber for examination.
