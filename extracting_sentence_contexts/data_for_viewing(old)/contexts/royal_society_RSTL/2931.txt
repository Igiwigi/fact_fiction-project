exists also in the larva, as I have had opportunities of observing in the laryz of the
Sphinges, Puss Moth, &. From these observations it is clear that a very large pro-
portion of the heat eyolved by insects in all their states passes off into the surrounding
medium, and that the amount of heat evolyed is in proportion to the degree of excite-
ment and consequent quantity of respiration.

WH. Temperature of different Tribes of Insects,

Having found that every insect maintains its own temperature of body, and that
the amount of this temperature differs in the different states of each insect, it yet re-
mains to be seen which are the families that generate the greatest amount, and
what relation that amount in the different families bears to the habits and localities
of the species. Our previous obseryations lead us to anticipate the fact that the
volant insects in their perfect state have the highest temperature, while on pursuing
the inquiry it is found that those species which have the lowest temperature are con-
stantly located on the earth. Among the volant insects, those hymenopterous and
lepidopterous species haye the highest temperature which pass nearly the whole of
their active condition on the wing in the open atmosphere, either busily engaged
in the face of day despoiling the blossoms of their honied treasures, or flitting wan-
tonly from flower to flower and breathing the largest amount of atmospheric influence.
Of these it may be almost superfluous to remark, the Hive Bee and its long train of
near and distant affinities, and the eJegant and sportive Butterflies have the highest.
Next to these probably are their predatory enemies the Hornets and Wasps, and others
of the same order; and lastly, a tribe of insects which have always attracted attention,
and in general are located on the ground, but sometimes enjoy the volant condition,
