Turbulence in plasma happens at many scales, from the largest to those below the proton
Larmor radius. To understand at what scales the MHD description is adequate, one needs to
reiterate a few known facts [32,68]. Indeed, to describe magnetized plasma dynamics one should
deal with three characteristic length scales: the ion gyroradius ;, the ion mean free path length
mfp, i arising from Coulomb collisions, and the scale L of large-scale variation of magnetic and
velocity fields.

The MHD approximation is definitely applicable to ‘strongly collisional’ plasma with
lmtp,i K pi- This is the case, for example, of star interiors and most accretion disc systems. For
such ‘strongly collisional’ plasmas a standard Chapman-Enskog expansion provides a fluid
description of the plasma [69], with a two-fluid model for scales between mfp, i and the ion
skin-depth 4, = p;/./Bj and an MHD description at scales much larger than §j.

Hot and rarefied astrophysical plasmas are often ‘weakly collisional’ with ¢mfp,i > pi- Indeed,
the relation that follows from the standard formula for the Coulomb collision frequency (e.g. [70])
