Very few experi-
mental data were available, and Drube applied his formule only to the magnetic
rotations of carbon disulphide and of creosote and to the natural rotatory power of
quartz, which he expressed by the two-term equation

containing two arbitrary constants /,, k,, and one constant, \,*, derived from measure-
ments of refraction ; the dispersion constant of the second term was omitted as being
negligible in comparison with )*. Perhaps on account of the lack of suitable data, the
new formule were not applied to any single member of the vast array of optically active
organic compounds which have been prepared and studied, more especially from the
time of Pasteur onwards. In view of the very limited application of these formule by Drupr himself, the
indefinite number of arbitrary constants which they contained, and the fact that a
complete knowledge of the refractive dispersion of the medium was presupposed, it is
not surprising that Drupr’s formule remained almost barren so far as their immediate
application to measurements of rotatory dispersion was concerned. Fifteen years of
work on rotatory dispersion (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, 1912, vol. 212, p. 261; ‘ Trans.
