One cannot conclude, however, that these granules represent the real
chromatin of the nucleus, for the same result can be obtained with ordinary
vegetative nuclei (e.g., the nuclei of the cells sheathing the oosphere). The results obtained by Fiscuer (22-24) in his experiments in fixing and staining, —
in which he shows how large a part physical condition plays in relation to staining
reaction, must make one very careful in distinguishing substances by their various
staining powers. The fact clearly remains, however, that the adult female nucleus
consists mainly of a substance which is not chromatin—a substance which though, both
on its first appearance and during the later stages of the nucleus, sharply dis-

tinguishable from the chromatin, yet in the mature condition of the nucleus can no
longer be differentiated from it. The most striking characteristic of this metaplasmie substance is, that at certain
stages it has as strong, or almost as strong, an affinity for nuclear stains as has
chromatin itself. This metaplasmic substance first makes its appearance in the form of granules
(fig. 11); later, however, as has been noted above, the granular appearance is lost,
and the nucleus becomes filled with a uniformly staining meshwork.
