three horizontal series so that the successive corresponding internodes may be com-
pared. In addition, in the fourth horizontal series the consecutive pairs of measure-
ments of series B and Cx are added together so as to show the actual lengths of the
strengthened axes from their base to the insertion of the second leaf, that is to the
commencement of the tendril apparently opposed to this.

The series of numbers recording the successive internode-lengths and the correspond-
ing curves (see Curve 25) are irregular. But when analysed into three sub-series and
three sub-curves in the manner just indicated, the numbers become ranged into three
consistent sub-series, and the irregular zigzag internode-curve becomes analysed into
three consistent and tolerably regular sub-curves (see Curve 26). Now, if the series or
internode-curves be analysed into two, four, or five sub-series or sub-curves, no such
consistence or regularity results. These facts indicate that, whatever be the interpreta-
tion of the construction of the awis, it is determined by three sets of component unitsâ€”
morphological or physiological in significance.

This conclusion conforms with the view upheld by Sz. Hinarre, Roeper, Brawn,
Kuerzinc, Wicanb, and Ercuter, that the stem of Ampelopsis is a concatenation of
the basal parts of alternately unifoliar and bifoliar branches, which terminate in
tendrils.
