British Ass80ciation at Montreal,* and have been observed at intervals since, with
results which are, I think, of interest. In these cells, the legs representing the zinoy.
were charged with a strongt but fluid amalgam of zine and mercury ; 80 that if the
other legs had been charged with pure mercury and paste of mercurous sulphate, an
ordinary CLARK would have resulted. This, however, was nob done. No paste at all
was used, and in place of pure mercury a dilute amalgam was substituted—in H (1, 3)
one obtained by diluting the strong amalgam with its own volume of pure mercury,
and in H (1,4) one containing one volume of strong amalgam to three volumes of pure
mercury. The cells were filled up, as usual, with zine sulphate soJution.

The electromotive forces, expressed as fractions of No. 1, are recorded in the
adjoining table (XVII.). It is clear that the E.M.F. rises rapidly with temperature—
something like 30 per cent. for 15* F. The large amount, of this variation, and the fact
of its taking place in the opposite direction to that followed by CLark's, are very
remarkable.
