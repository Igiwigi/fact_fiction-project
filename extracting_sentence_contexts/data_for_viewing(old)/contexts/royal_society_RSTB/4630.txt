and receives small factors from the base of the bladder. It enters the
afferent renal just anterior to the cloacal vein.

The following three systems are, strictly speaking, all parts of the one hepatic
portal series of veins, since they all take blood to the liver. For convenience, however,
they may be treated separately and dealt with as a main hepatic portal system with
two closely related accessory systems, that of the anterior abdominal vein and that
of the epigastric veins.

The Hepatic Portal System (text-figs. 10 and 12).

This system is, on the whole, similar to that in Lacerta viridis and figured by
Hocustetrer (loc. cit., Plate 16, fig. 15). It differs mainly in the fact that it has a
large anterior gastric factor, which itself gives off a number of portal branches directly
to the liver.

A. Vena porta or Vena hepatica advehens (Hocusterrer) (text-figs. 10 and 12).—
The hepatic portal vein is quite a short trunk formed mainly by the union of the
lieno-gastrie (A. I) and intestinal (A. IL) veins, and is distributed mainly to the
right lobes of the liver, while the left lobes of the liver are supplied almost
entirely by the anterior gastric factor (A. IIT).

A. I. Vena gastero-lienalis (Hocustrrrer) (text-fig. 10).—The lieno-gastric vein
is formed at the anterior end of the spleen, when a number of small factors
and one larger one (A. I. 8) from that body join a small gastric vein (A. I. @).
