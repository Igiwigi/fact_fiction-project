There can be no doubt that the texture or “ quality” of the chitinous surface has a
profound effect on the appearance of scules, just as it has on other objects. An
extreme instance of this nature is seen in various Lycienide of the genus Polyom-
matus, the sheen of which might at first sight be thought iridescent. As a matter
of fact, the pigment of the scales is no brighter than that seen in many dull orange
Pierids, and the metallic glitter is entirely due to the highly polished surface, which
gives the insect the appearance of burnished copper. In the case of many orange
Lyceenidee the violet sheen found is due to a layer of specialised scales.

of the formation and development of the scales of Danaida plexippus, LINN., is given by Mayer, ‘Bul. Mus.
