pendous effects have been produced.

Some to escape the difficulties in which this question is
involved, ascribe our inequalities to original formation ; as if
the world had come from the hand of the Creator withithe
variegated surface which now contributes 0 much” to its
beauty ; but the frequent interruptions; and resumptions of the
Strata in our area, with the perfect resemblance of the corres-
ponding parts, however great the mterval by which they are
separated, can' scarcely leave a'doubt that these strata were at
first 'continuous ; of course, the figure of our surface at: that
time must have depended on the original positions and incli-
nations of 'these strata, which, as appears by the-gd fact; are
now unconnected with the superficial line, the figure of which
is governed hy their abruptions and removals alone.

Naturalists have differed much in opinion as to the direc-
tion in which the causes acted that produced the inequalities
on the surface of our globe ; some referring us to the bowels
of the” earth as to the scene of action ; while others assert
that the operations were performed upon the surface itself.

But the slightest inspection of our facades will at once prove
that the first hypothesis cannot-be correct z for obliquity of
