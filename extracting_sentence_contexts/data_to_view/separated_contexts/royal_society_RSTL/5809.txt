S The beds in the lower half of the Serra del Solfizio were probably from the first very
2 teeply inclined, for they consist chiefly of agglomerates, containing many angular frag-
S ments of lava, implying a neighbouring vent; and we need not perhaps attribute more
2 than a fifth part of their present dip to a tilting of the mass by subsequent dis-
E turbances. Z The fact that the steepest dips occur where the dikes are most numerous, may be
Z = thought by many to favour the doctrine that the high inclination of the beds was the
Z effect of the injection of melted matter into such innumerable fisxures. Without deny-
S ing that it may sometimes have been an auxiliary cause, we must, on the other hand,
S remember that the dikes are always nearest the great centres of eruption, and that
E there are three reasons why the original dips should be greatest near such centres ;â€”lst,
& because the heavier and larger fragments of rock thrown out of the crater fall nearest to
5 its margin; 2ndly, because the red-hot scoriz, as before mentioned, are sometimes
S agglutinated together ; and 3rdly (an influential circumstance too often overlooked), be-
cause streams of lava frequently stop short when they have crept but a small way down = the declivity of the cone.
