apparently of the lowest vegetable life, which are found in innumerable 8warms in the
bowel-textures and bowel-discharges of the sick; penetrating from the former to diffuse
thronghout the patient's general system *, and teeming in the latter to represent, as this
view supposes, the possible germs of epidemic infection.”

As regards the medical profession, results like the foregoing and the interpretations
affixed to them, are simply revolutionary. They are, therefore, not likely to be
accepted without opposition. At a Meeting of the Pathological Society, held on the
6th of last April, the germ-theory of disease was formally introduced as a subject for
discussion, the debate being continued with great ability and earnestness at snbsequent
meetings. 'The Conference was attended by many distinguished medical men, some
of whom were profoundly influenced by the arguments, and none of whom disputed
the facts brought forward against the theory on that occasion. The leader of the
debate, and the most prominent speaker, was Dr. Ba8TIAN, to whom also fell the task of
replying on all the questions raised. The coexistence of Bacteria and contagious
disease was admitted ; but instead of considering these organisms as * probably the
esence, or an inseparable part of the essence” of the contagium, Dr. BasvIaN
contended that they were © pathological products,” spontaneously generated in the
body after it had been rendered diseased by the real contagium. The grouping of
the ultimate particles of matter to form living organisms, Dr. BasTIAN considers to
be an operation as little requiring the action of antecedent life as their grouping
to form any of the © other less complex chemical compounds.” Such a position
must, of course, stand or fall by the evidence which its supporter is able to produce;
and accordingly Dr. BasTIAN appeals to the law and testimony of experiment as
demonstrating the soundness of his view. He seems quite aware of the gravity of
