VdmilR1 and VdHy1 is presumably required for conidia
VdR3 might have multiple functions. Because overexpression and/or microsclerotium formation during the saprophytic
of VdR3 increased VdmilR1, while increased VdmilR1 phase when wilt symptoms appear, as observed in cotton
reduced the virulence of V. dahliae in cotton plants, a VdR3- plants infected with wild-type V592, but not with VdHy1
overexpressing strain increased virulence in cotton plants deletion mutant strains.
