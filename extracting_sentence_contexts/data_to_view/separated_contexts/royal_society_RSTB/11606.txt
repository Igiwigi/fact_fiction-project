Sex differences
in selection result in evolutionary dynamics that parallel the
local adaptation scenario (figure 1, right). Selection promotes
allele frequency differentiation between breeding females
and males of the population (q;> 4; > 4m; see figure 1),
whereas the equal genetic contributions of each sex to repro-
duction equalize allele frequencies in female and male
offspring (4141 = (qe + Im)/2; figure 1). In fact, the evolution-
ary dynamics of the two scenarios of selection become
mathematically indistinguishable when adults from habitats
1 and 2 contribute equally to the production of offspring of
the next generation (c, = c. = 4, 81 = Sp and sj = Sy; figure 1
and table 1). The dynamical similarities between scenarios of local
adaptation and sex differences in selection provide an
example of a wider range of parallels between the concepts. For example, over short evolutionary intervals, both scenarios
can maintain stable genetic variation for fitness [10,47], stabil-
ize linkage disequilibrium in the absence of epistasis [32,50],
and select for tightly linked clusters of alleles that are exclu-
sively beneficial within a given habitat or sex [48,51-54].
