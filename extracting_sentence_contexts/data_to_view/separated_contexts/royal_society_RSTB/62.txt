It consequently happened, as the most frequent exception to the classical
effect, that instead of the diphasic variation, indicative of negativity at the first and
second contacts respectively, we obtained only a simple variation. We think that

the apparent local negativity developed under these conditions was in different cases
attributable to either of two causes: (1) injury; (2) the excitatory state. The first
cause is indicated by a single permanent deflection, the second by a single swing ; and
that this is an excitatory effect is indicated by the fact that the first variation
consequent on excitation is often followed by a second or a third such variation, and
that the series of single variations thus initiated may terminate with a typical
diphasic variation. We have exceptionally noticed that local excitation might give
rise to a single variation, indicating that the electrode furthest from the point of
