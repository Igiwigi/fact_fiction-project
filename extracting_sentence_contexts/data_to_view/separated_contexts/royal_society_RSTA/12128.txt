On hypothesis () the whole ether is fixed and imperturbable by the motion of
atter. The portion enshrouded by matter at any instant has properties differing
from those of free ether, but the modification is only connected with the matter
sing it in the same sort of way as a shadow is connected with the object casting it. Of the two hypotheses, there can be no question but that the second is the simpler
and considered as a hypothesis is preferable, but we must enquire whether it is
competent to sustain the weight of all known facts. Fresnew’s Hypothesis.

4, It is notorious that the hypothesis at present holding the field is not exactly
rither of these, but is some form of the bold and picturesque idea of FRESNEL; viz.,
that in addition to the free and undisturbed ether of space existing equally everywhere
and flowing through the pores of gross matter, there is an extra quantity of
nd ether fixed to the matter and travelling with it ; this additional quantity being
— 1/n®)" of the whole. This idea of Fresnex’s seems, at first sight, essentially to involve the condensation of ether by matter,
80 that its density inside bodies is n?; for the fixed ether is superposed upon the normal ether of
ee. (Certainly the converse is true; viz., that extra ethereal density involves Fresnut’s law, as will
be shortly shown.)
- Now the facts of gravitation, and many electrostatic experiments, suggest that the ether is practically
hcompressible ; hence the notion of any actual increase of density,inside gross matter is repugnant,
Presyen, however, himself pointed out, in a subsequently written postscript to his original letter
0 Anago* promulgating his famous hypothesis, that the extra density need not be taken too literally.
