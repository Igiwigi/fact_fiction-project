Before we discuss the known results for the existence and uniqueness of such vortex solutions,
let us take the time to quickly review the classical ground states. These are solutions in the form
ew (p) for the profile equation (1.2), which are well understood in the literature. In fact, its
existence and uniqueness [1-3] in all dimensions and appropriate values, namely p € (1, pn),

was shown in [3]. Furthermore, the stability behavior of these (unique) solutions is also well
known [4]; this is in fact one of the main classes of examples that was worked out within the
Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss formalism [4,5]. Concisely, these waves are spectrally /orbitally /linearly
stable for p € (1,1+4/n) and unstable for p € (1 + 4/n, p*) [6].
