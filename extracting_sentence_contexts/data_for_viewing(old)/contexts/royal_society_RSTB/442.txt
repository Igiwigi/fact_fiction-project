like the rays of a fan, of which the handle if broadened would represent the crus
cerebri, while if the fan be considered to be held laterally in a plane parallel to the
sagittal section of the hemisphere, the outside rays would correspond respectively
with what we shall hereafter term the antero-inferior and postero-superior borders of
the internal capsule, this is represented in fig. 3, which is a photograph of a sagittal

‘ section of a Monkey’s brain (Macacus sinicus).

Viewed in horizontal section the capsule is limited by lines drawn at right
angles to the anterior and posterior extremities of the lenticular nucleus. .

Although this view of the fibres composing the internal capsule is useful to bear in
mind, it nevertheless does not express the whole facts of the case. In the first place
we have to remember that extending down towards the base of the brain, 7.e., towards
the basal ganglia and internal capsule, is a large number of fibres converging front all
parts of the cortex mantle.

Arranged in order from before back, these fibres may be enumerated as follows,
irrespective of the impulses which they are generally considered to convey, classified
according to the region of the cortex with which they are apparently connected.
