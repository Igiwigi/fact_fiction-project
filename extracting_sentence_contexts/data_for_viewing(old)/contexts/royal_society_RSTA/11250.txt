R= complex cuprammonium ion. He says (/oc. cit., p. 344): “The first solutions used were those of copper
gad ammonium chlorides with just enough ammonia added to each to bring out the deep blue colour of
“She copper.” This is certainly not the colour of the copper ion. In support of this statement it may be
entioned that the deep blue ion of FrHLinc’s solution, which has as much right to be called copper as
as the deep blue ion of WHETHAM’S experiment, can be proved by direct observation to be a negative
Qion, which travels towards the anode while its associated K ions carry the current towards the cathode.
This observation led the author, in conjunction with B. D. STEELE, to an investigation of the cupro-
tartrates, which they propose to communicate to the Chemical Society. Attention is there directed to
earlier evidence of the same fact adduced by others.

* Some trials were made with agar-agar in place of gelatine. It proved inferior, however, in respect to
freedom from electrolytic impurity ; and, though it affords jellies of high melting-point, and otherwise
admirable, they have the fatal habit, after setting firm in the tube, of contracting away from its walls and
exuding an aqueous solution. It is then easy to blow the whole cylinder of jelly out of the tube by the
application of slight pressure at one end. The gelatine jellies used by the author showed no such
tendency ; nor did any extension from the tube occur in the course of the experiments in the manner
described by Lopcr. The difference may be due to the use of stiffer jellies, and particularly to the use of
a constant temperature bath to prevent heating of the jelly by the current,
