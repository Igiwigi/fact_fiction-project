on the number of coils. The diameter at this magnification, in both a tapetal chromo-
some (fig. 46, Plate 17) and an archesporial chromosome (fig. 26, Plate 17), is of the
order of 1 mm. The length of the thread is then of the order of 1 x 14x 7=43 mm.
if a spiral is treated as a pile of circles. This value is only a rough estimate and a more
refined method is worked out in Appendix I. According to this the length of the
tapetal chromosome at metaphase (fig. 46) works out as 42-7 mm. and the archesporial
anaphase (fig. 26) as 41-1 mm. The tapetal anaphase of fig. 47 is under suspicion of
being swollen by the fixative, for its result is unexpectedly high (49-1 mm.). Every
method of estimation, however, contains elements of uncertainty most of which tend
to make the result too big (cf. p. 203 below). The general agreement between the results
of calculation and measurement is therefore rather striking.

The obvious conclusions arising from these facts are: (1) That the length of the
chromosome thread is probably constant throughout mitosis though the closeness of
the coils can change.{ (2) That the thread is twisted at all times except at prophase,
when one twist gives place to another (cf. Koshy 1933; Darlington 1935; etc.). (3) That
except at prophase the twist is perfectly stable and is therefore probably constructional.

* The presence of two kinds of contortions in the prophase chromosome was first, and correctly,
distinguished by Darlington (1935), who gave them the names of “‘super-spiral’’ and “relic spiral”
respectively. These names will not be used here from the general desire to simplify terminology.
“Super-spiral’’, for the zigzag seen in Osmunda is also of doubtful validity. “Super”, in the sense of
“additional” it certainly is, but whether it is a ‘‘spiral” and not merely a fortuitous bending is not
evident.
