Hence on substitution we have, since the number of values of y is 2,

which agrees with the result in question. We now see why it is that, although in the investigation of the latter formula we
had to take distinct account of the terms u and v in the fraction X 3; in the final result
they are recombined, and only present themselves implicitly as component parts of X- It is due to the fact that the equation determining the irrational factor of the original
integral wants a second term, 7. e. that p,=0. Ifp,=1, the term—0| o(a)?
