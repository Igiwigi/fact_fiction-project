However,
the intermediate UV-terms can be cancelled quite efficiently with DR. If desired, one can obtain the same results with the
subtraction procedure used to renormalize the EMT. We illustrated already this fact in the appendix B of [57]. The important
point here is not about regularization but about renormalization: indeed, the subtraction prescription (6.6) involves not just
the UV-divergences but the full expression obtained from the sum of the first three terms (j = 0, 1,2) in the DeWitt-Schwinger
expansion (6.4). This is, of course, entirely different from the MS renormalization prescription.


result (5.2) and, with it, we end up anew with the renormalized VED as given in equation (5.5)
(q.e.d.)

Finally, we can derive the RG equation for the VED.
