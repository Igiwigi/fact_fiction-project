most of its course, the axial organ does not lie in the angle of the alimentary canal,
and is therefore not in a position to produce the effect which he supposes.

To his description of the later stages of the cystid, subsequent to the rupture of
the vestibular roof, I have little to add ; but it may be as well to give a brief sketch of
the principal changes which occur. ;

The whole floor of the vestibule, as well as the cesophagus, is lined by ciliated
columnar epithelium. The walls of the stomach are formed by high columnar cells, the
free ends of which are merged (in sections) in a structureless granular mass (fig. 39).
Prrrisr attributes this to the extreme delicacy of the cells, causing instant decompo-
sition after death ; but I am more inclined to regard this mass as a form of secretion
from the cells than as due to bad preservation ; and I may call attention to the fact
that W. Tomson (21, p. 525) described glandular folds in the stomach, of which he
says, “ the slightest touch, even of a hair, ruptures them and causes the effusion of a
multitude of minute granules, some colourless and transparent, and others of a yellow
or brownish hue.” I regret to say that I made no observations with respect to this
point on the living animal. It is also possible that these granules are the last traces

of the histolysis: at a later period the margins of the cells are often quite easily seen,
and are clothed with long cilia.

Very soon after the rupture of the roof of the vestibule the anus opens to the
exterior, and the alimentary canal at once becomes filled with the siliceous skeletons of
diatoms, &c., which render the cutting of thin sections almost impossible. Lupwie,
