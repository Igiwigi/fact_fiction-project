For example, many unicellular green algae,
such as Platymonas, display a calcium-sensitive contractile protein, called centrin, as part of their striated ciliary rootlet,
which, upon membrane depolarization and calcium influx, drives local membrane bending and flagellum protrusion/retrac-
tion [153-156]. In Alveolata (a group which includes ciliates and dinoflagellates), the centrin-based system is hugely
expanded into a cell-wide contractile apparatus, which is able to drive contraction of the entire cell in some ciliates (like Para-
mecium or Stentor), or of large specialized cellular structuresâ€”such as the piston of the dinoflagellate Erythropsidinium [157],
or the stalk of the ciliate Vorticella [158] which quickly retracts upon mechanical or photic stimulation. In fact, centrin has been
discovered independently as part of the contractile apparatus of Vorticella, the spasmoneme, and given the name spasmin
[34,159-166]. Another mechanism for excitation- and calcium-dependent fast retraction evolved convergently in the rhizarian
Actinocoryne and is mediated by catastrophic disassembly of microtubules [167-172]. Both the centrin/spasmin system and
the microtubule disassembly-based systems allow faster contractions during escape response than actomyosin.
