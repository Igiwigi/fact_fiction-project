for the electrical resonance. A coil is thus made with three wires of 0.5mm diameter in parallel,
each of them representing 10Â° turns. The corresponding direct current resistance due to the Joule
effect in the copper wire is equal to 2100 Q, which is below the optimal 3050 Q. However, no
external resistor was added to the shunt in order to prevent any overdamped configuration that
could result from additional damping in the magnetic material or in the piezoelectric patches.
The inductor in figure 82 is finally obtained and connected to the piezoelectric patches. Figure 8b
shows a 23 dB vibration reduction compared with the cases with short- or open-circuited patches.
Those results shows the efficiency of the piezoelectric tuned vibration absorber when the electrical
resonance is correctly tuned to the mechanical one.

However, the results in figure 9a show the limits of the linear shunt, which was tuned in
order to approximate an equal-peak configuration at low forcing amplitude. In accordance with
figure 1b, increasing forcing amplitudes generate a strong detuning of the absorber. In fact, the
detuning is even more significant in the present case because of a slight increase of both the
piezoelectric capacitance and the inductance value. For the inductance, recall that our passive
component is made of magnetic material that does not behave purely linearly, as shown in
equation (3.2). Concerning the piezoelectric capacitance, it was experimentally noticed that it is
