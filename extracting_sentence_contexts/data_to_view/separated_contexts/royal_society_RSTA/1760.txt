As a

Europe. Projections for future years from a 2005 baseline show major reductions for 2020, mainly : =

particle number emissions from combustion sources are highly sensitive to the sulfur content : =
of the fuel, and motor fuels have steadily reduced their sulfur content, now less than 10 parts : =
per million, and shipping fuels are progressively reducing sulfur but not yet to the same degree. 3S
A notable exception is emissions from jet aircraft for which fuels still contain several hundred Lo
parts per million of sulfur, and emissions from major airports are detectable in the atmosphere 18
in a number of major European cities at a considerable distance from the main point of emission :s
[41,42]. Ultrafine particles from road traffic comprise both a soot mode of primarily graphitic 1S

carbon with a lesser amount of associated organic matter, and a nucleation mode which is
primarily semi-volatile organic compounds condensed on the surface of a very small nucleus
of sulfuric acid or inorganic ash derived from engine emissions [5]. The nucleated component has
tended in the past to dominate particle number emissions, but the reduction in the sulfur content
of road vehicle fuels, which took place in late 2007 in the UK and at similar times elsewhere in
Europe, led to a very major reduction in particle number concentrations at roadside locations such
as Marylebone Road [43].
