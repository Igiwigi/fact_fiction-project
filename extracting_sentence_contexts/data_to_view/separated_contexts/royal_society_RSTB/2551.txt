Regarding the “line,” it may be said that very often the mere fissure between the
two halves of a septum, which forms readily in all sections, often gives the appearance
”; but such a fissure usually ends irregularly in smailer cracks, or
bends suddenly out of the median plane across one of the halves. It is, therefore, easy
to distinguish it from a “ dark line,” which breaks up into a series of ‘‘ dark points.” Several authors have observed that the “ dark line ” in certain genera is so constituted,
but it was long looked upon as a fairly accepted fact that the median “dark line” in
other genera, e.g., Huphyllia, Flabellum, was a really continuous line representing a
special median lamina, Huinpz (Introd., p. 99), in examining Septastrea, a genus
structurally resembling Flabellwm, found, instead of a distinct lamina in the median

of a median “line

plane of the septum, a separable fenestrated tissue on the inner or median surfaces of
both halves of the septum. Those are the already observed facts on which the theory rests of a ‘ primary
septum ” composed of “ primary spines.” No one has sought to explain the origin of
the said “spines,” or how it came about that they are so remarkably varied in size,
colour, composition, whereas the rest of the septum, throughout the whole group of
Madreporaria, has a perfectly definite fibrous calcareous structure.
