The mammalian SCN provides an internal representa-
tion of the light-dark cycle [193] and therefore provides
an essential timing signal for target tissues in the central
nervous system and peripheral organs (figure 1). The SCN
has therefore been historically coined as the ‘conductor’ of
the clocks in the rest of the body [2]. However, this paradigm
is primarily based on evidence gathered under laboratory con-
ditions, when most peripheral Zeitgebers are aligned with the
light-dark cycle. Under natural conditions not all relevant
environmental variables show stable, aligned daily cycles,
and the notion of the SCN as orchestrator is stretched to its
limits. In fact, maximization of fitness is reliant on plasticity
in the timing of these peripheral rhythms, as well as behav-
ioural activity that is associated with non-photic cycles and
patterns. These real-life considerations suggest that an SCN-
centric view is in direct contradiction with maximizing fitness.

We have shown here that timing of behavioural activity
associated with, for example, the endocrine system, food
availability and other factors is associated with peripheral
clocks and rhythms. Moreover, there are many examples of
non-photic Zeitgebers driving clocks and rhythms in the per-
iphery, often dissociated from the light-dark cycle. Even a
lack of food per se will have a dramatic impact on overt and
