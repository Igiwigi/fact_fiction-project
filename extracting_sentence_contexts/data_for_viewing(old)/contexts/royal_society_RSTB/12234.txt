were collected and/or recorded during a time of changes in sub-
sistence patterns, with the increasing influence of the introduction
of large animals [45], intensive agriculture [44,50], market tran-
sition [10,11,64] and colonialism on the world [10], suggesting
that transitions away from matriliny were much more likely
to have occurred than transitions towards itâ€”and as a result
of immediate, ecologically consistent and historically recent
causes. These findings have two clear implications for traditional
views of matrilineal transitions. First, and unsurprisingly, these
results do not support the claim of a broad cross-cultural tran-
sition away from matriliny of the sort envisioned by the
unilineal evolutionists as a universal stage of human social evol-
ution, though such an assumption was once widespread, a fact
for which we see ample evidence in the early ethnographic
texts we coded (see electronic supplementary material, Note 8).
Second, while our evidence suggests that Murdock was correct
in thinking that reverse transitions are comparatively rare, the lit-
erature we have reviewed above, along with our own findings,
suggest that in the ethnographic record Murdock (and we) exam-
ined, the game of transition was rigged in favour of transitions

away from matriliny and against transitions towards it. Moreover,
the unique historical conditions of the past few hundred years are
likely not representative of most of human history, raising the
question of whether we would expect to see similar patterns of
