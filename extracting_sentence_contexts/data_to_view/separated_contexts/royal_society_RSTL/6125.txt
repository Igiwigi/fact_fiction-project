We will now proceed to describe what is the effect of the metalloids, and afterwards
of the metals, on the conducting power of copper.

1. Effect of Oxygen (Suboxide of Copper). Copper readily absorbs oxygen from the air when in a fused state; and it is 8upposed
to be present as suboxide, which it retains very obstinately; and in fact we may
lead hydrogen over fused copper, i a porcelain tube, for hours without completely
reducing the suboxide. It is also very difficult to prevent the oxygen being absorbed
during casting, &c. In order to prevent all these sources of error, we thought that in
making the alloys of copper by the following method, we might obviate them :—
