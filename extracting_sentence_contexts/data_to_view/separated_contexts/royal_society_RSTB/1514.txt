ArrcHison gives me of M. rhesus, at Simla, deals only generally
with the breeding season and the time of bearing young ; but, from his observations, it
would seem to be not improbable that the gestation of this animal occupies consider-
ably more than seven months’ time. The fact that there is a definite breeding season for these animals, if it be true (as [
cannot but think it is), conveys of course no proof that each female breeds each year. The only evidence which I have to record which bears on this point, is the
fact that menstruation undoubtedly occurs while the mother is nursing her young. I have noted for three months the occurrence of yery regular menstrual periods in
the case of a specimen of M. cynomolgus, which was nursing a young one at the time. It is true the mother did not supply all the nourishment the young one took, but I
think I am right in saying she supplied most of it.
