illegitimate, for it would make the reflected waves assisted in their progress by the
reflected drift just as much as the incident waves are assisted ; whereas they are really
ravelling in the teeth of the wind, their progress being impeded and their wave-length
shortened just as much as the incident waves are helped and lengthened (or of course
ce versd). Plainly the drift is not reflected, but must be supposed to act on the
yaves emitted by the image exactly as it acts on the waves emitted by the source.
Another tempting thing to do is to start a system of waves from source and its
ordinary image simultaneously, both subject to precisely the same drift velocity, one
ng the incident, the other the reflected system. But applying this, and taking a
air of waves intersecting at any one point of the mirror, it will be found they have
travelled the same distance to get there, nor have they taken the same time, and
he drift of their centres has been different. Moreover, they do not intersect at a
second point of the same wave, and, in fact, the system behind the mirror is not in
5 any sense the image of the front set.
The really essential thing is that the phase of the reflected wave shall be identical
With that of its incident exciter at the point of contact with the mirror, and accord-
ingly that the time of virtual journey from any point to be considered as an image is

Nothing less direct or more geometrical than this seems satisfactory, so it had better
2 applied in its usual Huyghenian baldness. At the same time a little caution is

essary in using HuyGHeEnsâ€™ construction in a moving medium, for the centre of the
elementary waves does not remain at the point of incidence, but drifts away, as in
fg. 4, and the construction has to remember this, or it will go wrong.
