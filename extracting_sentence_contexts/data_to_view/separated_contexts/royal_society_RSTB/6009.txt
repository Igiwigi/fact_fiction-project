The canalicular and cochlear portions of the auditory capsule are now connected
by cartilage, both anteriorly and posteriorly. Between the posterior orbital cartilage,
pila antotica, anterior parachordal, and auditory capsule there is now, therefore, a
deep and wide notch, the incisura antotica, through which all the branches of the
trigeminal nerve emerge. It is important to notice the fact that the pila antotica (p.a.)
here possesses its typical relation, lying in front of all the trigeminal roots. The posterior or definitive occipital arch (0.4) is growing upwards and forms a
posterior boundary to the fissura metotica (f.m.), through which the glossopharyngeal,
vagus, and spinal accessory nerves emerge. Opposite the centre of the fissura metotica,
however, and ventral to the canalicular portion of the auditory capsule, an isolated
cartilage has made its appearance ; following Sontms this may be called the metotic
cartilage (me.c.).
