It is s0on seen, after a few touches, that that limb |
alone contracts the nerve of which was exposed to the action of the direct dis [
charge. We may therefore conclude that the action of electricity upon the mixed nerves of
an animal living or recently killed, is reduced to the two following facts :â€”

1. ' The electric discharge traversing a nerve awakens muscular contraction ; but
this contraction is much stronger when produced by the direct discharge than when
it is excited by the inverse discharge. |
2, The electric current circulating through a nerve of a living animal, or an animal a

newly killed, produces a variation in the excitability of the nerye: if the current is 1
direct, the excitability is diminished and destroyed ; while, on the contrary, the exci- |
tability is preserved and increased by the passage of the inverse current.
