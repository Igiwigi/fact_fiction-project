Marine cloud brightening 4239

In fact, both these aspects were considered, if not entirely resolved, by Salter
et al. [4] and this section mainly concentrates on new developments. That paper
had already concluded that sea-level dispersal of an evaporating spray had
decisive advantages over the more direct approach of cloud seeding from aircraft
and that, among the several alternative strategies, dedicated sea-going vessels
propelled by Flettner rotors (which facilitated an unmanned operation) were the
preferred technical choice as well as being, by a considerable margin, the cheapest
and ‘greenest’ route. The performance of Flettner rotors had not, however, been
examined for more than 80 years and thus in §5c our first results based on CFD
of the dynamic performance of a single rotor are presented.
