However, it is possible that participants in those tasks
simply did not process the words sufficiently in the shallow
conditions. To address this, Niedenthal ef al. conducted
another experiment explicitly designed to manipulate the
strategic need for emotion simulation [35]. Participants gener-
ated features of emotional concepts (e.g. FRUSTRATION) by
thinking of and listing associated properties, while facial
EMG was recorded. Crucially though, depending on con-
dition, participants were informed that the features were
being produced either for an audience that was interested
in emotional ‘hot’ features of the concepts (like a good
friend with whom they have a close relationship and can
share anything), or for an audience interested in more factual
‘cold’ features of the emotion concepts (like a supervisor with
whom they have a formal relationship). Participants were
able to produce normatively appropriate emotion features
in both the ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ conditions—reflecting deep pro-
cessing. However, the EMG showed that there was greater
activation of the facial muscles when participants were
asked for features of emotion words in the ‘hot’ compared
with the ‘cold’ audience condition.

This finding is consistent with evidence that embodied
simulations are recruited in concept understanding, but
only when they are relevant for the task [36]. Again, this is
