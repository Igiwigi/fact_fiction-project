17, is taken, that
after a while the same strength of stimulation cansed a series of ventricular contractions when the
auricles and sinus were nob heated, and no effect whatever when the nerve was stimulated during
the time of heating ; in other words, when the strength of the impulses was made still weaker by the
heating, the rise of excitability cansed by the vagus stimulation was not sufficient to make those impulses
efficient to canse ventricular contractions. Also (as is seen in Plate 69, fig. 17, B, C, D) during the conrse of the experiment each series of
ventricular contractions lasted on the whole a shorter and shorter time, and commenced later and later

after the end of the stimulationâ€”a fact which is to be explained by the progressive exhanstion of the
whole heart. THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1017

alternately strong and weak beats.
