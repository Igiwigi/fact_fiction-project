At first, as the species
spreads, the number of individuals must tend to increase. But over the very long
periods which have to be considered there must be a countervailing tendency to ultimate
decrease in the number of individuals, owing to the increase in the number of species. The area available being limited, the tendency, as it seems to me, must be towards greater
and greater numbers of species and fewer individuals in each.* Possibly the fact that
ignoration of the number of individuals leads to results in close accordance with the data
may only indicate this tendency first to increase and then to decrease in the size of the
species.

(c) The possible effect of size of genus (number of species in the genus) on the chance
of a generic mutation is also ignored. This assumption may or may not be correct, but
was deliberate. The generic characters are regarded as representing a main position
of stability, and the chance of occurrence of a transfer from one main position of stability
to another is regarded as independent of the number of minor positions of stability
(species) which may: have been taken up within the main position (genus).

(d) If A, B, C, D are the existing genera and one of them throws a generic mutation,
it is assumed that this will represent a new genus E. â€˜The possibility is ignored that A,
for example, may throw a generic mutation which will be classed under the already
existing genus B.
