Group IIL shows this downward tendency
strongly, and so does, to a marked degree, the line j1 in Group L., which line, it
should be mentioned, was measured both in Set A and Set B of the photographs with
concordant results. There is thus some reason for believing that there is a departure from a strict
linear relationship in the direction already indicated. A study of the negatives themselves reveals the difficulties to be encountered in
measuring the displacements and in fixing upon the most intense portions of the lines,
and it is at once admitted that the downward tendency of two or three of the lines
should not be allowed to disturb our belief in the simpler relation; but the fact that
all the gold lines, with the exception of 11, present the same feature, taken in
conjunction with the fact that the copper lines are similarly affected (if their
behaviour up to 200 atmospheres be taken into account), provides strong evidence
that though the relation between the displacement and the pressure is approximately
linear, there is a slightly greater increase of the displacement with the pressure at
low than at high pressures.

(7) Displacement and Reversal of Lines.—The displacement diagrams for iron
suggested a departure from the linear relationship at those pressures at which a large
number of reversals appeared. No reversals have been observed in the spectrum of
the gold are, so that the slight departure from a linear relationship, discussed in the
preceding section, cannot be associated with the phenomenon observed in the
iron are.

7. Changes in Relative Intensity under Pressure.—This is not so prominent a
feature of the gold are under pressure as it is of the copper and silver spectra ; in the
former, all the lines belonging (in the region investigated) to Kayser and Runcer’'s
series vanished under pressure, and well-marked changes also took place in those
lines which were not members of any particular series, while in the silver arc the line
spectrum vanished completely under pressure.
