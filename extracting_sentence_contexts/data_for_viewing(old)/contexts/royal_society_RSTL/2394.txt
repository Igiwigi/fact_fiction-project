thesis. For almost all the volcanoes in the old world of considerable magnitude
are near, or at no considerable distance from the sea: and if it be assumed
that the first eruptions are produced by the action of sea water upon the metals
of the earths, and that considerable cavities are left by-the oxidated metals
thrown out as lava, the results of their action are such as might: be antici-
pated ; for after the first eruptions, the oxidations which produce the subse-
quent ones may take place in the caverns below the surface ; and when the
sea is distant, as in the yoleanoes of South America, they may be supplied
with water from great subterranean lakes ; as HumBorpr states that some of
them throw up quantities of fish.

On the hypothesis of a chemical cause for yolcanic fires, and reasoning from
known facts, there appears to me no other adequate source than the oxidation
of the metals which form the bases of the earths and alkalies ; but it must not
be denied that considerations derived from thermometrical experiments on the
temperature of mines and of sources of hot water, render it probable that the
interior of the globe possesses a very high temperature : and the hypothesis of
the nucleus of the globe being composed of fluid matter, offers a still more
simple solution of the phenomena of yolcanic fires than that which has been
just developed.

Whatever opinion may be ultimately formed or adopted on this subject, I
hope that. these inquiries on the actual products of a yolcano in eruption
will not be without interest for the Royal Society,
