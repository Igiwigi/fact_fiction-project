t has been brought to the authors’ attention that some
statements in our Concluding Remarks of Article 5 may
be interpreted to indicate that by using an Artificial

eural Network (ANN), it may be possible to use less
than one sensor per pallet to implement an effective First
Expiring First Out (FEFO) solution, which is not our
intention. We emphasize the fact that at least one sensor per
pallet is required for effective FEFO solutions. The ANN
concept discussion is stating that in some instances,
sensors are not needed at the inner core of the pallet
to predict that temperature. For ANN, several sensors
around the outside of each pallet can predict the
pallet core temperature, and may even provide valuable
information on how much heat is being generated by live
fresh fruit and vegetables, which through respiration are
creating heat.
