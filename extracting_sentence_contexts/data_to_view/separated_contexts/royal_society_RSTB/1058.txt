If each area had an equal number of spores on it to begin with, we should exy
the order of clearness, 7.e., the sharpness of the figure, to be in the order of 4
exposure, C was exposed 6 hours, D only 5 hours, whence C should be es
than D. Nowin the figure this is not the case. But it was the case the day h
and the only reason that C is not now the clearer is because a large number of or
have germinated on the area C, and are rendering it somewhat obscure. j

As a matter of fact, the order of clearness of the areas was just what we show
expect in Stage I.

The “ ghosts” or faint secondary circles on this plate are not easy to explain. ©
thought they were due to internal reflection, but it is not improbable that they

This experiment shows, then, that 6 hours’ exposure to the rays of the ele i
transmitted vid quartz, results in the death of an enormous number of spores, andi
is very probable that only such spores escaped on D and C as were directly b
(and therefore screened by) a number of others. The film was a dense one, an¢
contingencies were certain to arise.
