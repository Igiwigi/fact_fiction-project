WATSON ON A DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF

The value of F changes slightly with temperature, and assuming the coefficient of
expansion of the coils to be 0'0000187, a table of the values of F for each degree of
the range of temperature met with during the observations was drawn up. A consideration of the figures given in the tables of measurements will show that,
as might be expected, the greatest variations occur in the measurements of the
external radii of the coils. Taking into account the fact that the internal radii can
be determined with more accuracy, the mean radius ought not to differ from the
truth by as much as 0°005 centim, The distance between the mean planes is
probably known to within about the same amount. Thus the uncertainty in F
appears to be less than 5 parts in 30,000. This corresponds to an uncertainty in H
of about 3 in the fifth place. ;

The adjustments which have to be made before the coils are used are as follows :—
