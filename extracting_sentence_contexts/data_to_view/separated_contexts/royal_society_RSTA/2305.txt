Namely, the stress
intensity factor, Ky, at the crack tip and the critical opening, u), at the opposite end of the process
zone. A thorough analysis of the numerical approach used showed the high level of stability
and accuracy, alongside the rapid rate of convergence, for the entire solution. Of particular note
was the fact that the values of both Ky and u; stabilize after only a small number of iterations,
although the required number of iterations is higher for smaller lengths of the process zone L. The fact that the method outlined here is more efficient for larger L is not unexpected, as the
initial condition (3.8) of the iterative process corresponds to the case L > oo. As such, although
the iterative method does converge for all positive L > 0, it is clear from the presented results that
both the solution accuracy and convergence rate improve with the growth of L.
