the number 32, not 16, as stated by Kny*; it is possible that this discrepancy of
result may be due to a fluctuation between the typical numbers 16 and 382, similar to
that which we have noted between 256 and 512 in Todea barbara, or between
8 and 16 in Cyathea dealbata; such differences plainly imply the completion or the
omission of one of those divisions which take place almost simultaneously in all the
cells of a sporogenous group. With these remarks we may leave the bulk of the
Polypodiaceous Ferns on one side, though it is probable that a careful and critical
examination of their output of spores in various types and under various circum-
stances would yield facts of interest.

On estimating the value of the results of these computations, it is first to be
remembered that the figures previously arrived at for the Marattiaceeet are high,
viz., for Kaulfussia, 7850 per sporangium ; for Marattia, 2500; for Danea, 1750, and
Angiopteris, 1450. The largest numbers are associated with more complete synangial
fusion, the smaller number in Angiopteris with separate sporangia, though the stalk
is short and thick. The potential number estimated for Gleichenia flabellata is
nearly equivalent to that of Angiopteris, though the actual countings run consider-
ably below; still they are in excess of those for any other Leptosporangiate Fern
observed, and as this is seen in a Fern in which the type of sorus is the same as
in Angiopteris, it strengthens the affinity between these two genera, notwithstanding
that the one is, as regards the mode of segmentation of the young sporangium, a
