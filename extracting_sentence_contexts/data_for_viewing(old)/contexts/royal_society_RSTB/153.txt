Tae manner in which the large arteries springing from the aorta in the higher
Vertebrates have been developed from a set of arches comparable to the branchial
vessels of Fishes has been clearly explained by Raruxs,* and since his time the
views which he first set forward in the year 1857 have been almost universally
accepted and taught. I have been led to believe, however, from the observation of
certain facts in the anatomy and development of Birds, that the deductions which
RarsHKeE made, drawn chiefly from his studies in Mammalian and Reptilian embryology,
are not applicable to this class in so far as concerns the origin of the carotid and
subclavian arteries. I am inclined to think also that the theories now generally
held will be found inadequate to explain the origin of these vessels in the case of
Chelonian and Crocodilian Reptiles, and to a less extent probably in Mammals.

ANATOMY OF THE LARGER ARTERIES IN Breps.

The aorta, arising from the left ventricle of the heart, passes at first forwards,
upwards, and to the right side ; then, changing its direction, it arches over the right
auricle, and, sweeping backwards dorsal to the root of the right lung, gains the
middle line. In the first part of its course two large vessels, the brachio-cephalic or
