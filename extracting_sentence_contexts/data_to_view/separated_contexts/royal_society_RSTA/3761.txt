The black solid line
indicates the logarithmic profile obtained through a fit to the data between 0.025 < y/R < 0.25 (range being indicated
through dashed lines); yielding Ay = 1.30, By = 1.81 and B) = 1.91 for equation (4.1), with free parameters and A, fixed to
the value of 1.26 found in [32], respectively. The red solid line represents DNS at Rt = 3008 [22]. (Online version in colour.)

yt (Rt)? values of 2.6-3.9 [7,32,50]. It should be noted that, while the location of the lower
bound for the logarithmic region in the aforementioned studies is found empirically, there is a
physical basis, as argued by Klewicki and co-workers [52,53]: this position, in fact, should locate
the start of the region where the mean dynamics lose a leading-order viscous effect. This thus
ensures a correspondence between the aforementioned empirical observation and the classical
notion that the logarithmic layer is an ‘inertial sublayer’ in physical space. Considering the streamwise variance profiles in inner scaling (figure 5a), the profiles
from the X-wire measurements in both the streamwise/spanwise and streamwise /wall-normal
configurations agree exceptionally well with each other and are in agreement with the single-
wire measurements, except for the lowest Reynolds number.
