They subsequently rose and fell to 8x 107° ampére
and 6°7x10~% ampére respectively. The difference between the two cases seems to
indicate that heating in hydrogen produces a permanent change in the constitution
of the platinum. There are two other facts which support this contention, One
is the permanent reduction of the value of the steady positive leak in oxygen
produced by continued heating in hydrogen, which was mentioned on p. 27. The
other is that the surface of a wire which has been heated for a long time in hydrogen
becomes visibly pitted and cracked. This change does not appear to be produced by
heating, to moderate temperatures at any rate, in oxygen.
