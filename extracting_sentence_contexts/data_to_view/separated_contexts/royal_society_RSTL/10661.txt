An examination of my results shows that the effects of stress on magnetism ay
on the whole, not greatly different whether the magnetisgm in question is residual ©
induced, and I am therefore disposed to regard the VILLARrt reversal as dependin;
rather on the value of the magnetisation than on the value of the magnetising fore hk This view receives strong confirmation from experiments which I have describe
in a paper, * On the production of transient electric currents in iron and te
conductors by twisting them when magnetised, &c.”* T have shown there that
the inclined pull and push which make up torsional stress give effects on a very
strongly magnetised wire which have the same sign as the effects of direct pull a
push on a feebly magnetised wire ; which is to be explained by the fact that thess

reversal when pull is applied in the direction of magnetisation. I hall therefore apply the term © VILLARI critical point” to name that value
the magnetisation J ab which reversal occurs in the sign of the magnetic difference.
produced by two (assigned) states of longitudinal stress. This point may be determined in two ways, which (on account of hysteresis) will
lead to different results.
