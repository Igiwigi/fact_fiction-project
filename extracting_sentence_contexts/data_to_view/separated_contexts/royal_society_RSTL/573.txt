But I am inclined to attribute the
eftect of vitriolization observed in some of the pyrites, not 80
much to the proportion, as to the state of the sulphur in the
compound; for I much suspect, that a predisposition to vitrio-
lization, in these pyrites, is produced by a small portion of oxygen

- being previously combined with a part, or with the general mass,
of the sulphur, at the time of the original formation of these
substances, so that the state of the sulphur is tending to that of
oxide, and thus the accession of a farther addition of oxygen
becomes facilitated, We have an example of similar effects in
phosphorus, when (as is commonly said) it is half burned, for the

purpose of preparing the phosphorus bottles ; and the propensity
to vitriolization, observed in many of the half-roasted sulphureous
ores, appears to me to arise from this cause, rather than from
the mere diminution of the original proportion of sulphur, or the
actual immediate conversion of part of it into sulphuric acid ;
nevertheless, I offer this opinion, at present, only as a probable
conjecture, which may be investigated by future experiments
and observations. The magnetical properties of the sulphuret of iron which
forms the principal subject of this Paper, must be regarded as a
remarkable fact; for I have not found, in the various publica-
tions on magnetism which I have had the means of consulting,
even the most remote hint, that iron when combined with
sulphur, is possessed of the power of receiving and retaining the
magnetic fluid; and, judging by the properties of common
pyrites, we might have supposed that sulphur annihilated this
power in iron, as indeed seems to: have been the opinion of
mineralogists, who have never enumerated magnetical attrac-
tion amongst the physical properties of those bodies ; and,
although WERNER, WIDENMANN, EMMERLING, and BROCHANT,
have arranged the magnetical pyrites with the sulphurets of
iron, yet the magnetical property could not with. certainty be
stated as inherent in the sulphuret, for, at that time, this sub-
stance had not been subjected to a regular: chemical analysis,
and the magnetical property might therefore be suspected' to
arise from interspersed particles of the common magnetical iron
ore. This probably has been- the opinion of the Abbe Hair;
for, in his extensive Treatise on Mineralogy lately published, I
cannot find any mention made of the magnetical pyrites, either
amongst the sulphurets or amongst the other ores of iron. 342 Mr. HaTonrTT's Analysis

In the mineral kingdom, a great variety of substances, and
even some of the gems, exert a feeble degree of attraction on
the magnetic needle, and sometimes also acquire a slight degree
of polarity;*
