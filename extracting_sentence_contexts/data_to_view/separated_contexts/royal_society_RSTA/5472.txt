Such an inference is confirmed by the slightly lower concentration
of sulfonate groups in the neighbouring zones, thereby hinting at larger separation between
molecules because of repulsive forces. The second peak, located 1nm from the cathode, points
at a different mechanism, which should be related to the accumulation of atoms. In fact, the
region experienced an increase in the amount of counterions, as well as more sulfonate groups and
water molecules that rearranged towards them. This local increase of atomic concentration would
bestow stronger interactions, ultimately manifesting in higher stresses within the membrane. Another key result of the MD simulation is presented in figure 8, where we report the
components of the normal stress perpendicular to the electric field.
