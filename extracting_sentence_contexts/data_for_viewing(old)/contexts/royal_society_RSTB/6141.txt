THE CELL WALL OF THE CONIFER TRACHEID 145

of their inclination to the cell axis. Unfortunately we cannot test this relation
directly. The only evidence we can as yet obtain concerns the tracheids cut off
by the initials; this bears only indirectly on the initials themselves. Without
making any further assumptions, however, we can work out a corresponding formula
for the tracheids. This formula obviously refers to the radial walls only, since they
alone undergo the full extension of the initial. The individual tangential walls
formed at each division have undergone only a negligible part of this extension and
so cannot be treated by argument along the present lines. It seems reasonable to
suggest, however, that since these walls undergo such little extension, very little
change in the direction of their fibrils will take place. This is, in fact, found to be
so; there is no change in fibrillar direction on tangential walls of tracheids from
year to year. Since the formula for the tracheid is here developed from that of the
initial the test which is made later of this formula is necessarily a test of that applying
to the initial. Certain details of the development of tracheids from cambial initials
will be neglected in the development of these considerations. â€˜Their investigation,
which would make the present argument unnecessarily lengthy, has been left to the
final discussion.

Consider a cambial initial which has just divided by a tangential wall and one
half of which is about to expand radially to form a differentiating tracheid. Let A,
fig. 11(a), represent the cambial initial, the wall seen in surface view being the radial
