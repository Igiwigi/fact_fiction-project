Measurements were made from X-ray films used for examining the heart size of the
chests of five members of the Expedition, both at sea-level and at Oroya or Cerro de
Pasco, with the object of determining: (1) whether there was any observable
difference in the dimensions of the chest as the result of temporary residence at a high
altitude; and (2) whether any difference existed between the proportions of the
chests of ourselves and members of the native population. For the latter comparison
X-ray pictures were made of the chests of seven Peruvians who had resided for many
years at a high altitude. Measurement.â€”The selection of indices for measurement was guided largely by
practical considerations, resulting from the fact that the Expedition was equipped
with X-ray films for use in studying heart size, which were smaller (11 x 14 in.) than
is desirable for chest measurement. The points to be measured consequently had to
be chosen so that they could be found on the pictures made with these smaller films.
