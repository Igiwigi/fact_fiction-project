their exponentially decaying surface brightness (the rotational velocities remain constant with
increasing distance or ‘flat’ as they are commonly referred to). This kinematic behaviour is broadly
attributed to the presence of haloes of non-radiant, non-baryonic Dark Matter (DM) which is
thought to surround the disks of spiral galaxies (and also contribute to the dynamics of ellipticals,
which exhibit velocity dispersions in disagreement with the stellar matter content implied by their
light distribution). It is generally assumed that this component consists of some sort of as-yet
unknown particle associated with the high energy physics interactions (supersymmetric particles
were the most favoured candidates, but the most recent LHC experiments failed to discover any).
One should also note that even in the presence of such particles, ‘flat’ rotation curves demand
rather fine tuning between the amount and distributions of luminous and dark matter.

The second issue concerns the apparent lack of deceleration in the expansion of the Universe,
in fact an acceleration, at late times. This was determined by measuring the flux of a large number
of type Ia supernovae, considered standard candles, that occur at a specific redshifts z and forming
the ensuing redshift-magnitude relation. Fits of the evolution of the Universe to this relation


is best achieved by adding a cosmological term, A/3, to the equations that describe the scale
factor evolution of an homogeneous and isotropic universe [1]. Its energy density is such that it
contributes roughly 70% to the present closure density of the Universe, a value some 120 orders
of magnitude smaller than the ‘natural’ value of such a term, which it is believed ought to be of
order of the Planck energy density.

A rather interesting fact, noted some time ago [2], is that the introduction of DM to account
for the galactic rotation curves becomes necessary at regions where the acceleration of the
