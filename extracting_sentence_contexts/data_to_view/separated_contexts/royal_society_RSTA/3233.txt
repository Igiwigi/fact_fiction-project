Figure 2 sets the stage for the rest of this review, in which we will concern ourselves with the
cosmological implications of this Higgs near-criticality. In the first part of the review, we consider
the (preferred) case in which the EW vacuum is in the metastability region. We should then worry
about its fate during cosmological evolution and we discuss in the following sections EW vacuum
decay via quantum tunnelling through the barrier that separates our vacuum from the deeper
high field region beyond Aj; decay by thermal fluctuations over that barrier; decay triggered
during inflation; and finally decay right after inflation, in the preheating era.> In the second part
of the review, we consider the (less likely) possibility that the EW vacuum is in fact stable, case in
which one can entertain the idea that the Higgs might be responsible for inflation [62-66]. In my
discussion I will present a critical view on this very appealing idea.

2. Decay by quantum tunnelling

The decay rate of the metastable EW vacuum (per unit time and unit volume) can be calculated
semiclassically: it is ~ ht exp(—S4), where Ii is the field value in the unstable region towards which
the vacuum decays (Ay < hy < Mp}), and Sy is the action of the four-dimensional Euclidean bounce
solution that interpolates between the EW vacuum and the new phase at high field values.
