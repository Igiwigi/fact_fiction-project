This recess receives the lower opening of
the posterior semicircular canal, and the posterior opening of the lateral canal. Just
before opening into the recess, these canals communicate with one another by a
perforation in the septum semicirculare posterius. Owing to the fact that the fosse
subarcuatee (interna and externa) are shallow, the massa angularis (between the
posterior and lateral canals) is thick. The median wall of the cavum canaliculare is
perforated by the foramen endolymphaticum, and by the pressure-deficiency mentioned
above. 5.
