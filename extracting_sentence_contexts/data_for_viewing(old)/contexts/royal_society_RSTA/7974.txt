The absence of “ peroxides” with benzole has been explained by subsequent
work.

For the aldehydes there was very little falling off of concentration as the length
of the tube connecting the “ droplet ’ chamber with the valve increased, whereas with
the “ peroxides’? a marked decrease was noticed, so that the actual “ peroxide ”
content in the cylinder was probably considerably higher than that measured.

In his experiments on the supercharged petrol engine, MuckLow* found nitric acid
to collect in the pipe which connected the non-return valve of the maximum cylinder
pressure indicator to the pressure gauge. This gave evidence of the formation of
oxides of nitrogen in the engine at the moment of maximum pressure. The occurrence
of a similar effect in the Delco engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem
of the sampling valve showed distinct signs of acid corrosion after being in use for a
short time.

Griess’s reagent (1 cc 0-1%%, solution of naphthylamine in N/100 acetic acid and
1 cc 0-5%, solution of sulphanilic acid in N/100 acetic acid + 0-1 ce glacial acetic
acid) is a sensitive test for nitrous acid, and well suited to the “ droplet ’’ method of
analysis. On applying this test to the gas sampled from the engine, it was found
that the “ droplets ”’ coloured a bright pink in 2 minutes at the point of maximum
“ peroxides,” and also in the same time both at the position of maximum aldehydes
(no “ peroxides”) and at a position 10° later than this. The “ droplet ”’ coloured in
4 minutes at a point 10° prior to that for maximum “‘ peroxides,”’ at which setting
the KI reagent showed hardly any coloration.
