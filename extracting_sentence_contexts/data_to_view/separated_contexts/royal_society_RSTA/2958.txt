Results concerning the existence and stability of the symmetric and antisymmetric states are
summarized, severally, in parameter planes (y,P) and (¢,P) displayed in figures 6 and 7. First,
a salient feature of these results is that while, at e =0, the antisymmetric mode has a smaller
stability interval than its symmetric counterpart, its stability area at « > 0 is dramatically larger
than the one for the symmetric mode. This difference is explained by the fact that the central
barrier, imposed by ¢ > 0, is favourable for the antisymmetric states, whose wave function nearly
vanishes at x = 0, and is obviously unfavourable for the symmetric states, which tend to have
a maximum at x=0. Eventually, the antisymmetric states disappear at very larger values of e,
where the central potential barrier (4.1), multiplied by a very large ¢, suppresses all possible
modes in the potential box. Furthermore, while a trend well-known in many PT-symmetric systems is that the increase
of the gain-loss coefficient, y, leads to the breaking of the PT symmetry at a critical value of y
[2-9], the stability region for the antisymmetric mode in figure 6a,b originally demonstrates slight
expansion with the increase of y, before the mode disappears at y exceeding the critical value.
