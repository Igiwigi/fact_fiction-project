integrate the human in an interesting way. But this touches upon almost all aspects of our lives:
how we live, how we work, how we operate and how we think and how we understand value
creation in the future!

Ina first step, we will show that it is possible to include the human in this fourth revolution
conceptually in different ways, in line with other reported proposals [7]. The scope of this
endeavour can be seen by addressing the following questions: Who is the digitalized and
networked human that interacts with a digitalized and networked environment? What is her/his
knowledge, capability, role and/or business [8-10]? Moreover, humans are involved in different
roles in Industry 4.0 (14.0). For instance, a role can be that of a machine-designer, a user or a service
technician. Each role requires a different set of digitalized data, information and knowledge that
must be available to the humans to fulfil that role and also to be understood by her/him in order to
act accordingly. The model to be used needs also to cover the fact that the human can be linked to
different phases of the life cycle of all digitalized and interconnected components of the industrial
ecosystem.

A solution for this complex task is provided by the formalization of the digitalization
and networking process for the industrial environment via the Reference Architecture for
Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) [11]. It includes the digitalization and networking of physical objects,
which in industrial environments are referred to as Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)
[4] or Industrial Internet-of-Things (IloT), and are accompanied with the respective semantic
technologies and architectural principles. This provides the base for an industrial ecosystem of
services (Industrial Internet-of-Services (IloS)) [12]. An indication of this structured context is
shown in figure 1.
