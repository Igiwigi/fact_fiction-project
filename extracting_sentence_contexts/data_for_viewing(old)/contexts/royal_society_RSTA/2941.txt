Using the multiscale analysis, we seek the solution in the following waveform:

En0(t0, t+.) = At, Jel"—O) 4 AM, .. eH) 4 CC, ...)

and Xn0(T, T1, ---) = B(t,...JeH" VEO) 4 BET, . Jel —Vem)

The particular solution considered for the axial displacement (&;9) consists of the superposition
of the travelling wave solution and its slowly evolving offset (C(r1,...)). In fact, an offset of the
travelling wave solution can only build up in the axial direction due to the periodic boundary
conditions assumed in this direction. As for the lateral response of the outer elements, no offset of
the shear wave solution is possible (in the lateral direction), as all the outer elements are attached
to the rigid wall (figure 6). Proceeding with the multiscale analysis as in [57], the following
is the explicit expression for the first-order term in the expansion of the angular coordinate
(@ni(to, T1,---)):

Oni (00, Ty) = (A(t, -- Jel 2) 4 A*(ty,.. Je7H"-0)) gin Gg(t1,.-.)

In the present problem under consideration, we are mainly interested in depicting the regimes
