It is a partial differential equation of order 2
and the wavefield g(r, t) is a continuous function of four variables (three dimensions in space and
one in time). Therefore, the solution to the wave equation has to be a function described over a
‘hypervolume’ with four variables and its boundary is a ‘hypersurface’ with three variables [12]. In fact, there are two possibilities for the three variables of the hypersurface. It can be two
spatial dimensions and one time dimension. This is the so-called Cauchy boundary conditions
(BCs) that prescribe both the field g(r, t) and its normal derivative dg(r, t)/dn for r along a two-
dimensional surface S for all time t.
