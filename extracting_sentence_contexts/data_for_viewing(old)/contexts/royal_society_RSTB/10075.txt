(e) QPX

Most known bivalve diseases have affected oyster species,
although a recently described disease, caused by an unnamed
thraustochytrid parasite called QPX (quahog parasite
unknown) has caused mortality in the hard clam (=quahog),
Mercenaria mercenaria, in the northeastern USA [41,87]. In con-
trast to the previously described obligate pathogens of oysters,
QPX is considered to be a facultative parasite, which, like
others in the group, can live on macroalgae and detritus [88].
In fact, QPX DNA can be found widely distributed in environ-
ments where QPX-associated clam mortalities are documented
[89]. The parasite appears to be favoured by colder tempera-
tures [42] and is not found south of Chesapeake Bay. QPX
can be transmitted directly and high density tends to increase
prevalence [43,90], but there is no evidence that it is associated
with hatchery production of clam seed [91]. On the other hand,
QPX has been linked to clam culture practices, including the
use, in northern climes, of southern seed clams, which grow
fast, but are more susceptible to infection [92].
