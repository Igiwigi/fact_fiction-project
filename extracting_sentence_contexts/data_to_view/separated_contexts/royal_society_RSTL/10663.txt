The curves, however, show a very close similarity
throughout. The commencing relaxation caused by the snbstitution of 1 to 1,000
Auctic acid is een in each case. A The very gradual shortening of the muscle upon the firs6 application of potash
gnd soda is, to some extent, due to the fact that the muscles had been previously
Surarized. When curara has not been previously employed the first application of
dilute solutions causes a more rapid primary contraction, though the total effect of
She application may not be greater, if as great as in the curarised muscle. Plate 9,
Ag. 33, gives the effect of a stronger solution of s0da, 4.e., 1 to 2,500, and the 8ub-
-Zequent relaxation it undergoes upon the application of 1 to 500 lactic acid,
5 Plate 9, figs. 34 and 35, give the action of soda 1 to 4,000, and potash 1 to 6,000,
ith partial relaxation consequent to lactic acid.
