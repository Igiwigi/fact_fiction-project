For this to be the case,
more detailed simulations in higher dimensions would be required. The gains presented are also
not in themselves particularly remarkable, with much higher gains being regularly reported for
simulation work. Rather, the notable and novel aspect of this work is in its identification of a
regime where instability growth is expected to be low, and the fact that 1D simulations suggest
that reasonable gain is possible in such a regime. The 1D simulations are intended only to provide
an indication of performance, but it is believed that this initial estimate is sufficiently high to
warrant further investigation of this regime and approach. The inability of 1D simulation codes to provide an accurate predictive capability is a
significant obstacle to achieving ignition, and attempts to mitigate this issue (aside from this
paperâ€™s approach of operating in a regime where these capabilities are better) are under
development.
