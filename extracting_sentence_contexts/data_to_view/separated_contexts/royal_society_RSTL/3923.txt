In this way there remain two halves of the frog united together organically
by their spinal nerves. When this frog is required to be used for the purpose of dis-
covering the presence and direction of the muscular current, it should be disposed
upon an insulating plane in snch a manner that its two extremities or claws dip
into two separate recipients. Joining these two: recipients with strings of cotton
or thread, soaked with the same liquid as that contained in the recipients them-
selyes, or with a strip of paper similarly wetted, no sign of contraction is ever pro-
duced, therefore no current is in circulation. 'This last fact may easily be proved
by closing the circuit with the two ends of the platinum wire of a delicate galya-
nometer, provided we can be perfectly certain of the homogeneity of the sub-
stance of the extremities of the wires. And it will be seen that it cannot be other-
wise, on reflecting that each half of the frog constitutes an electro-motor element
of the proper current, s0 that, in the above-described manner of using the prepared
frog, there are always two equal currents circulating in contrary directions, and
which consequently neither excite contractions, nor deflect the needle of the galva-
nometer. There is nothing easier, and at the same time more decisive, than the confirmation
of the existence of the muscular current and of its direction.
