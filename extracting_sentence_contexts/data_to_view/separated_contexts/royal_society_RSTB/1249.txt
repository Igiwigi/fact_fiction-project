Brown, Sir Josera Hooker, WILLIAMSON, and others; a concise
atement of their results will be found in Soums-LauBacu’s ‘Fossil Botany’ (Engi.
d., p. 232, &e.). It is to be noted, however, that the comparison with the sporangia
‘living forms has been limited, partly perhaps owing to the incomplete knowledge
f the sporangia of modern Lycopods. The facts which have been collected and
escribed in the preceding pages make it possible to draw the comparisons closer.

The magnificent silicified cones in the British Museum have supplied the
important material. 1 take this opportunity of thanking the Keeper of the Boj
Department, not only for giving the free use of the specimens, but for
agreeing to my suggestions for cutting new sections of parts of these rare foss

It is possible in microscopic sections of the cone to study its parts with the
detail as those of a modern Lycopod, while, since the sections in the British ]
are cut in all three directions, transverse, radial, and tangential, a very satis
knowledge of the structure both of the axis and sporophylls, and also ¢
sporangia, may be acquired.
