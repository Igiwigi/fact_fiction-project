‘present definition can at least claim serious consideration, on the grounds that it agrees
awith the ‘classical’ definition, and that most of the standard theorems of classical norm
Gtheory are special cases of the results of this section.t Moreover, these results are closely
sgeonnected with the problem mentioned at the end of § 1; it is hoped that they will help to
Ssuggest a method for its solution.

: In order to avoid trivial exceptional cases, attention is restricted to modules of a class H,
defined as follows: The class H shall consist of all R-submodules m of L such that both S:m=+- (0)
, sgand m: S+(0). It is clear that every non-null G-ideal belongs to H, and hence, using (1.3),

Bthat necessary and sufficient conditions for m to belong to H are: (i) MER. (a, ...,%,),
Bich some @,,...,¢,€ LZ, and (ii) m contains n linearly independent elements. The product
“Bofa finite neice of members of H belongs to 1; in fact, His closed under the four operations
St,.;: -,1, and n. The module complementary to a member of H also belongs to H. When
Eine maximal condition holds in , every member of H has a finite R-basis.

Clarendon type Greek letters are used to stand for ordered sets of n elements of L; thus
