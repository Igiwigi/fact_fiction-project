preceding years, but, as might be looked for in a dry year like the past, the quantities
deposited at the various stations are more nearly equal than usual; in other words,
the differences are not s0 great or striking as obtain in either wet or average
periods.

A trifling change in the position of the gauge on Seatollar Common in Borrowdale,
has led to some rather startling results, which promise in time to guide us to the
proximate cause of the enormous excess of rain in this valley over every other in the
Lake country. It is expected that this gauge (Seatollar, supposed to be 1300 feet
above the sea), which has hitherto obtained about one-fifth /ess, will in future impound
quite as much, or even more rain than the noted vale of Borrowdale.

The year 1849 has not enabled me to add any new fact of importance to those
already communicated to the Royal Society in reference to this part of the inquiry ;
and as the past annual period has evidently been of an anomalous character, I think
it better to avoid drawing any inference or conclusion from the results which it has
afforded. I am the more inclined to defer deductions to a future time, from the
cireumstance of my having been compelled to estimate the heights of some of the
mountain stations, which have never been measured ; and because I hope to have an
opportunity of taking the altitudes myself in the course of the ensning summer.
These scanty remarks must therefore be regarded as a mere supplement to the papers
previously printed in the Philosophical Transactions.
