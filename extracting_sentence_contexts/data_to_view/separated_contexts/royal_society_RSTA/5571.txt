If we look at Tables V. and VIL. we see that the interval between the crests of
the principal and secondary pulses is somewhere about 15 days, but the crests are so
rounded that the interval might well be a day or more short of this. The fact reminded
me of Prof. Scuuster’s remark about a 13°64-day period ; it also suggested that we
might have to do with the half of Dr. Scummr’s period. It thus appeared desirable
to ascertain definitely whether the magnetic data employed in the previous investiga-
tions did or did not show a period. This was investigated in the following way :—

The 5 days of largest H range in each month were selected, and the magnetic
character figures put down in successive columns for each of these and the 35 subsequent
days.
