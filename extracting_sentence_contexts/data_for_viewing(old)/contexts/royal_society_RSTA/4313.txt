wind shear, mean and tidal currents, and even some large-scale turbulence and waves other than
those associated with the spectral peak. From this residue, the components with frequency higher
than the waves are extracted, and shown in a separate panel of figure 3. These components are
the primary candidates for our investigation of the wave-turbulence interactions directly. This
wave-turbulence separation is based only on EMD without explicit dynamical considerations.
As EMD can separate components with physical significance, we believe the dynamics are in fact
the determining factor implicitly. The results of this separation are also shown in the spectral
from in figure 2a. Granted that the wave-turbulence interactions are nonlinear in nature, this
additive extraction should not be expected to be complete. This is why the removal of the wave
components shows a slight overestimation that causes a dip in energy of the residue spectral
line. As the wave motion is many orders of magnitude higher than the turbulence, a very good
approximation is to use the additive method near the peak. This separation seems to be effective
and quite clean.

We then conducted a probability test on the separated components, and found some curious
results, as given in figure 2d. The sum of the higher-frequency components (IMF no. 1-5),
presumably the turbulence components, shows a highly non-Gaussian characteristics with
skewness at â€”0.07 and kurtosis at 3.87. On the other hand, the full residue consisting of all
