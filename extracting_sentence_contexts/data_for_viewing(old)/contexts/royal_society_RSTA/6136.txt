In the limit Y, — 00, we see that the Planck mass remains finite only for

-2<y<-lL (4.35)

and takes the form

Bf 3 Ay + Degyr r+) (4.36)
K 2Acy y+2 . .

This means that the interval (—co, —1), for which the solution (4.10) is defined, has to be refined
to (—2, —1), after taking into account the requirement of a finite Planck mass. Combining this fact
with the results of the previous subsection, we conclude that for a flat brane and a linear fluid
with y ¢ —1, it is not feasible to construct a regular solution that satisfies both the requirement for
a finite Planck mass given by (4.35) and the energy conditions.

(b) The special case y = —1 fora flat brane
Putting y = —1 in (4.3), we find
p=c1, (4.37)

where cj is an integration constant. Since p > 0 from (4.4), we see that c; has to be non-negative.
Substituting (4.37) in (4.4) we find
