that it is very small as compared with the overlapping of the skin-fields of adjacent
nerve-roots and bears no significant topographical relation to the overlapping of the
root-fields. On the other hand, I have shown previously* that the overlap of distri-
bution of the constituent fibres of each nerve-root itself is even greater than that of
the overlapping of contiguous nerve-roots.

Is the overlapping of the skin-fields of the spinal ganglia paralleled by overlapping
of the muscular fields of the motor spinal roots? In the hind limb of Macacus I was
able to confirm EckHarpt's conclusions as to the pluri-segmental innervation of the
limb-muscles, although EckHarpt’s observations had been confined to the hind limb
of the frog. In the pelvic limb of Macacus I found but one muscle (tensor fascie
femoris) with a nerve supply from a single spinal nerve-pair. The other muscles I
found to possess a bi-segmental or tri-segmental nerve-supply ; a fact since confirmed
for the same limb in the case of Man by a research by Parerson.t In the upper
limb I find similarly that the muscles are pluri-segmental, a greater number being
tri-segmental in the upper limb of Macacus than in the lower limb of that animal.
The subclavius muscle seems in some individuals, as I found also tensor fuscia femoris
and rectus capitis postici, to be uni-segmental, receiving its motor supply sometimes
from the VIth cervical nerve alone : it is in so far the only muscle I find uni-segmental
in the upper limb. As examples of bi-segmental muscles, I find the teres major and
anconeus. The palmaris longus, the supinator brevis, the supinator longus, anconeus,
and the extensor carpi ulnaris may serve as types of tri-segmental muscles, and of

quadri-segmental muscles the pronator quadratus, and flexor profundus digitorum (in
