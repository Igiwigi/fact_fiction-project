fracted by the water. If the fact is 80 in regard to the radiation of heat through a
mass of water four or five inches thick, where ought we to set the limits of thickness
of the mass through which it cannot pass? Obviously only where the thickness is 80
great, that the aggregation of the fluid, and of its minute impurities, prevents the
transmission of light, as in the deeps of the sea, but not within the ordinary depths
of our clear streams,

Of the effect of radiation in cooling down the surface of the ground, and substances
placed upon it, during a clear sky, we cannot give a more Jucid account than that of
M. Araco, in his paper © On the supposed Influence of the Moon on Vegetation.”
* No one had supposed,” says he, © before Dr. Wes, that terrestrial substances, ex-
cepting in the case of a very rapid evaporation, may acquire during the night a dif-
ferent temperature from that of the surrounding air. This important fact is now well
ascertained. On placing little masses of cotton down, &c. in the open air, it is fre-
quently observed that they acquire a temperature 6?, 7*®, or even 8? centigr. below
that of the surrounding atmosphere..... These differences of temperature between
solid bodies and the atmosphere only rise to 6?, 7*, or 8? of the centesimal scale, when
the sky is perfectly clear. If the sky is clouded they become insensible.” This lucid
statement, however, requires one modification ; for the greater cooling of the solid
snbstances, under a clear sky, takes place not only during the night, but also during
the day, in places not directly exposed to the sun's rays.

This radiation, as it passes freely through the transparent atmosphere, may, as we
learn from the above experiment, pass also through the transparent water, to cool
down the solid snbstances at the bottom below the temperature of the surrounding
