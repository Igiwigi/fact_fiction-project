One of the most
intriguing forms of anointing is ‘active anting’, in which
birds crush and smear ants into their plumage, or ‘passive
anting’, in which birds lie on ant mounds or trails and allow
ants to crawl through their feathers [75,76]. Anting has been
observed in more than 200 species of birds, most of them pas-
serines. The fact that birds use ants that secrete formic acid or
other pungent fluids suggests that the behaviour may kill or
deter ectoparasites. However, there is very little actual
evidence in support of this hypothesis [2,76]. An experimental test of anting in European starlings (Stur-
nus vulgaris) found that starlings with access to wood ants
(Formica rufa) engaged in anting behaviour, and had plumage
that smelled strongly of formic acid, unlike (control) starlings
that did not have access to ants [2].
