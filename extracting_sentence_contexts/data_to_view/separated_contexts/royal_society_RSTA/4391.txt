Comparison of the traces (i) and (ii)
indicates the effect of ion concentration on the blocking events. Upon increasing the concentration
of Kt ions from 1 to 3 M, the frequency of the pore blocking increases as indicated by the
relative increase in the intensity of the histogram peak corresponding to the blocked state
(figure 4, trace ii). This relates to the fact that high concentration of potassium ions increases
their probability to find the nanopore entrance, and subsequently block the pore channel. Traces
(iii) and (iv) show the transport data for Lit ions at two different driving potentials across the
nanopore. Consistent with the prediction of equation (2.1), the pore blocking current increases
from 150 pA to 5 nA, when the driving potential is increased from 0.6 V to 3 V.
