define the task which the statistician sets himself: briefly, and in its most concrete
form, the object of statistical methods is the reduction of data. A quantity of data,
which usually by its mere bulk is incapable of entering the mind, is to be replaced by
relatively few quantities which shall adequately represent the whole, or which, in other
words, shall contain as much as possible, ideally the whole, of the relevant information
contained in the original data.

This object is accomplished by constructing a hypothetical infinite population, of
which the actual data are regarded as constituting a random sample. The law of distri-
bution of this hypothetical population is specified by relatively few parameters, which
are sufficient to describe it exhaustively in respect of all qualities under discussion,
Any information given by the sample, which is of use in estimating the values of these
parameters, is relevant information. Since the number of independent facts supplied in

the data is usually far greater than the number of facts sought, much of the information
supplied by any actual sample is irrelevant. It is the object of the statistical processes
employed in the reduction of data to exclude this irrelevant information, and to isolate
the whole of the relevant information contained in the data.

When we speak of the probability of a certain object fulfilling a certain condition, we
