logists have till further enlarged the boundaries of error, by taking for granted that
all the fossil species of shells which are referrible by the characters of the $hell to
recent genera, must have been formed by animals which, in their recent state, pos-
sessed the same habits as the most commonly observed species of the genus to which
they appear to belong. These theories were, indeed, quite consistent with our former
ignorance of the habits of the animals of this class ; but since the works of Port,
MvuLuer, Montacu, Lamarck, and Cuviesr have induced zoologists again to turn
their attention, as was the practice among the older writers, to the animals of shells,
and their habits, and no longer to confine themselves, as was too often the case with
the followers of the Linnean system of conchology, to the study of the shells as mere
pieces of ornament, classed without reference to their inhabitants, the acknowledged
importance of the subject is daily bringing to our knowledge some animal unknown
before, and adding to our stock of information facts which prove the fallacy of the
opinions 80 hastily taken up. Thus, although even at the present day the animals of
less than one twentieth part of the well-known species of shells have been observed,
—and of those which are known the greater part have been very imperfectly de-
scribed,—numerous exceptions to the theories in question have been brought to
light, which deserve to be collected into one point of view, and made the subject of
serious consideration.

The exceptions which it is the object of the present paper to notice may be ar-
ranged under the two following heads :

1. Shells having every appearance of belonging to the same natural genus, but in-
habited by animals of a very different character.
