With reference to figure 2, it can be shown that at a boundary point such as 0 the derivative
is given by

h(dw/dx), = AL, os ius M,, (A. 8)

and, at a boundary point like 6,
= 1
h(@w/08)~V}— 3 a Vi (A.9) If the differences are now written in terms of functional values, an expression can be obtained
for the fictitious value —1 in terms of the boundary derivative and boundary and internal
values. Table 1 gives expressions for w_,, together with the error term or difference cor-
rection, according to the number (r) of differences replaced by pivotal values. TABLE 1
