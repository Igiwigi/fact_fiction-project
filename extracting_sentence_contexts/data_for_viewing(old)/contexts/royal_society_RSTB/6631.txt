with regard to the position of certain of its main parts, as, for instance, the utriculus.
(6) The presence of the ductus endolymphaticus and the fact that there probably was
a distinct fossa endolymphatica on the dorsal surface of the primordial neuro-cranium
beneath the dermal bones. (7) The fact that the ductus endolymphaticus perforated

the dermal cranial roof and had an external opening situated as in certain primitive
Selachians (Chlamydoselachus). (8) The general shape of the brain as far as this can be
restored from the exit of the nerve canals and the shape of the cavum cerebrale. (9) To
a certain extent the course and arrangement of the blood vessels and the presence of
certain important trunks, as, for instance, the vena hyoidea. (10) The fact that the
palato-quadrates as far as can be judged did not articulate with the ethmoid region but
must have been suspended below this by ligaments. (11) The probable course of the
anterior part of the supraorbital sensory canal. (It should also be mentioned that the
sensory canals must have had rather numerous sense organs and that they opened
outward with very many tubuli.)”’

In 1934 STENSIO, on the basis ofa comparison with Arthrodeirs, withdrew his account
of the ethmoidal region of Macropetalichthys and thereby removed Nos. 2, 3 and 4 from
this list. No. 8, the general shape of the brain as determined from the cranial cavity,
also falls to be modified. In SrEnsto’s fig. 10, representing the cranial cavity, the canals
for the olfactory tracts are represented as diverging very greatly, in order to reach
what were then presumed to be the nasal capsules. This great divergence is not shown
