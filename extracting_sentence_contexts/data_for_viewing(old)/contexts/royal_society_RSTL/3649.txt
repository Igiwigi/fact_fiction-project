In the churches, it being in the time of divine ſervice,
the greateſt confuſion and terror were occafioned. | The
congregations, ſuſpecting that either the [galleries or the
roofs were falling in, endeavoured to eſcape with the
utmoſt precipitation. Several people were thrown down
and trampled on, and ſome few had thieir limbs broken; ;
Nor is it to be wondered at that they were ſo terrified, as ;
the pillars and walls evidently tottered, and the motion ©
was ſo great as to toll the bells in the Collegiate and $t. :
Mary's churches. My ſons, who were at the latter,
aſſured me on their return, that they heard the bell -
twice during the laſt ſhock, and the facts-are beſides well
authenticated by variety of evidence.

The alarm was equally great in moſt of the places of» |
worihip in this town, except at St. Paul's church, which
is a low building at the North-eaſt fide of the town, with=|
out a ſteeple, and has a common ſhore running under it;
