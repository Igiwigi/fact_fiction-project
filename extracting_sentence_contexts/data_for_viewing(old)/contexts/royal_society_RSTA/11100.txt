These two values are widely different, but hoth are greater than the highest
refractivity which it is ever necessary to attribute to carbon. The inference is, either
that the index of boron is actually higher than that of carbon, or, that the presence
of boron has the effect of increasing the retarding power of Cl and Br in an abnormal
degree. It is difficult to say which of these slternatives is the more interesting ;
and the determination of the indices of BCl,, BBr,, and BH,, in the gaseous state,
ought to yield results of the highest importance,

This rule, that increased valency means increased refractivity, is no doubt closely
connected with GLApsToNnrâ€™s observation that, when an element, such as iron, forms
two compounds, that in which it has the highest valency has the highest refracting
power, and the allied fact that a double or treble bond is accompanied by increased
refracting power in the compound in which it occurs. The problem is one of great
interest and is yet unsolved.

. Beyond the bare fact that the refractivity does increase with the valency it is
difficult to go at present. I have tried, but in vain, to guess the law which connects
the refractivities of A, Cl, 8, and P (139, 192, 270, 297). It is easy to find specious
relations between two or three members of the series, but, until we know the indices
of the alkali elements, and can make a nearer approximation to the true values for
carbon, boron, and silicon, the data are insufficient, and speculation is useless.

Nor have I been more fortunate in my endeavours to find a meaning for the
numbers, 1, 2, 8, 12, and 20, which express the ratios between the refractivities of
