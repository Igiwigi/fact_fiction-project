SYNGE ON THE TIGHTNESS OF THE TEETH,

It is convenient to regard this excess over atmospheric pressure as due to (i) the axial
displacement w ; (ii) the transverse displacement v, 5, or, equivalently, to (i) the axial
load X ; (ii) the transverse load Y, N. Thus we may state the result :

THEOREM XXIII.—Jn the case of the conical model with a membrane of uniform thick-
ness, the excess of the pressure in the membrane over atmospheric pressure, due to the axial
load X, is, by (139),

2X / = ‘ies

where A is the area of the cross-section of the root at the margin of the membrane, and a is
the length of the root ; the excess of pressure, due to the transverse load Y, N, is

The excess of pressure due to the total load is found by adding the right-hand sides of (145)
and (146). We note the following facts :

TueoreM XXIV.—Under a purely axial load X, the pressure in the membrane increases
or decreases steadily from P —2X/A at the apex to P at the margin, according as X is
positive or negative. The critical axial load (which reduces the pressure at the apex to
zero) is a pulling force

when the atmospheric pressure is 15 lbs. per sq. in.*

The above force, when applied as an axial pressure, raises the pressure at the apex
to two atmospheres. The following results are immediate consequences of (146) :—

THEeoremM XXV.—The pressure in the section of the membrane by the diametral plane
perpendicular to the plane of the displacement is unaffected by the transverse force-system ;
it is given by (145).
