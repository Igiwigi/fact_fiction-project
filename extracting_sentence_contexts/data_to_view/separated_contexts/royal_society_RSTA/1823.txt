Horizontal lines mark the conservation of aâ€™ for the pump a
(yellow) and for the probe c, (red). The group- (GH) and phase- (PH) velocity horizons are also marked. (Online version in

The pump creates nonlinear effects by itself, in particular, the conservation of its co-moving D8
frequency creates new signals as resonant radiation (RR and RRjr), also known as Cherenkov : o
radiation or dispersive waves [51]. : ES

As we said, negative frequencies are essential for the derivation of Hawking radiation. In : 8
fact, the study of optical analogues led to the prediction of a new phase-matching condition : s
for resonant radiation. This was previously overlooked because it needs a mixing of positive 1

and negative frequencies. The new signal is called negative-frequency resonant radiation (NRR),
which has been measured in several experiments [12,52,53] and explained by Fabio Biancalana
and colleagues [54] using nonlinear optics.
