(3) An elliptic plate of uniform density.

(4) An electric current in an elliptic circuit.

Of these cases (2) leads to the approximate determination of the forces expressing
the mutual action between two solid ellipsoids or uniformly magnetized ellipsoids, and
(4) in certain cases to the forces between two currents in elliptic circuits, the particular
case of circular circuits being completely determinate.

Similar results also hold for rectangular solids and circuits.

The case (2) derives additional interest from the fact that it engaged the attention
of LAGRANGE, who obtained the expansion as far as the first four terms. The same
four terms have also been worked out in a very interesting paper on the potential of
an ellipsoid at an external point, by Colonel A. R. CLARKE (* Philosophical Magazine,”
1877, vol. ii., pp. 458-461).

In regard to case (3), Professor CayLEy, in the © Proceedings of the Mathematical
Society” for 1875, has obtained the s8olution in the form of an integral, from which he
derives interesting properties of the potential depending on certain particular positions
of the attracted point. The expansion in harmonic series would seem, however, to be
practically more useful in determining the mutual forces between two electrical circuits,

Throughout the following investigations, the method of treating Spherical Harmonics
