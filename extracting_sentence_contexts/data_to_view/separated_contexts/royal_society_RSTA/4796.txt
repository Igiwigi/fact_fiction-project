It was observed that for a specific range of barrier widths,
a frequency transformation occurs, i.e. only a certain fraction of spikes reaching the barrier is
able to cross it [35-37]. The most stable transformation returns the signal at half of the original
frequency, but the other firing numbers were also observed. The fact that a firing number is very sensitive to all parameters of the wave train can be used
for sensing distance between the source of excitation and a sensor formed by a set of channels. Experimental results are shown in figure 3 [38]. The medium is composed of an excitable part
(dark—non-illuminated) separated from four excitable channels by a non-excitable gap (light—
illuminated).
