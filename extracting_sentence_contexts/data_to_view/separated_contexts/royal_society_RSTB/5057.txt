The porphyry, spilite, and rhyolite clearly
belong to the Minchia Series, for they are associated from Li-kiang to A-tun-tze. The
granites are intrusive into the older grits, but we could not at first find clear evidence
of their intrusion into the Minchia Series ; it was possible that they might be pre-Minchia
in age, and the metamorphism of the Minchia beds might be due to the porphyries ;
but later field evidence left no doubt that the granites are intrusive into the Minchia
Series. This fact does not, however, prove the post-Minchia age of the igneous rocks ;
