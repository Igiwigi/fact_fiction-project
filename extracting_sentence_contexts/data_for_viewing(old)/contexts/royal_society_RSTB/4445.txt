These changes are common to all types of large Amphibia, although they proceed
at very different rates in the different stocks. For example, Micropholis, the latest
known Rachitomous Amphibian, has far larger palatal vacuities than any other
member of that order.

All Lower Permian Rachitomi have palatal vacuities very appreciably smaller
than those found in Triassic Stereospondyls, and the few known Upper Triassic forms
have them larger than those of any Lower Triassic types.

Another change which occurs progressively through the large Amphibia is a
gradual flattening of the dorsal surface of the skull and a decrease in depth. This
change is obvious in the first three drawings of fig. 31, and that it is general is
shown from the fact that there are far more high skulls amongst the Lower Permian
forms than in those of any later period; by the Upper Trias, in fact, all the known
forms are very flattened. At the same time considerably flattened forms such as
Trimerorachis do occur in the Lower Permian in aquatic animals.

Far more interesting, however, are the changes in the basicranial region and in
the brain case. These are most readily explained by comparing together Eryops,
the best known of the Lower Permian forms, and Capitosaurus.

Capitosaurus differs from Eryops in the following ways (cf. fig. 11) :â€”

1. The great reduction in size and degree of ossification of the basi-occipital
and basisphenoid, which results in the complete withdrawal of the former
