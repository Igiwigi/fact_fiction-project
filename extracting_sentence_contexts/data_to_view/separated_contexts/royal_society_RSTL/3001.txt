In some of the finer castings of brass, the
perfection of the work depends upon the intensity to which the metal is heated,
which in some cases is urged eyen beyond the melting point of iron. With a
fire whose power in all cases must s0 greatly exceed the temperature required,
it is necessary to bestow great care in supplying the metal gradually, as we
have before described ; as it is inconceivable with what rapidity it rises after
the solid pieces are completely dissolved. Evidence of the same fact may be
derived from the experiments of MM. CLemenT and Desormes, which I have
before quoted. They calculated the heat of melted iron at 3988?, and of iron
Jjust on the point of melting at 3164®,—a difference of 800?.
