surfaces equally placed in air are electrified, one positively and the other negatively,
that which is negative can discharge to the air at a tension a little lower than that
required for the positive ball : second, that when discharge does take place, much
more passes at each time from the positive than from the negative surface (1491.).
The last conclusion is very abundantly proved by the optical analysis of the positive
and negative brushes already described (1468.), the latter set of discharges being
found to recur five or six times oftener than the former*.

1502. If, now, a small ball be made to give brashes or brusby sparks by a powerful
machine, we can, in some measure, understand and relate the difference perceived
when it is rendered positive or negative. It is known to give when positive a much
larger and more powerful spark than when negative, and with greater facility (1482.);
in fact, the spark, although it takes away 80 much more electricity at once, com-
mences at a tension higher only in a small degree, if at all. On the other hand, if
rendered negative, though discharge may commence at a lower degree, it continues
but for a very short period, very little electricity passing away each time. These
circumstances are directly related, for the extent to which the positive spark can
reach, and the size and extent of the positive brush, are consequences of the capa-
bility which exists of much electricity passing off at one discharge from the positive
surface (1468. 1501.).

1503. But to relate these effects only to the form and size of the conductor, would,
according to my notion of induction, be a very imperfect mode of yiewing the whole

* A very excellent mode of examining the relation of Â«mall positive and negative surfaces would be by the
