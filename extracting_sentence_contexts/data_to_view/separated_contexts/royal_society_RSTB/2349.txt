That however is an objection of little or no weight. Many morpho-
logists have regarded the integument as a leaflet or a ligule, others as an indusium ;
on any of these views it would be an organ originally springing from the leaf and
free from the sporangium. That an organ at first merely surrounding the sporan-
gium should eventually come to be inserted upon it is perfectly intelligible ; floral
morphology abounds in parallel cases of “ congenital adhesion.” In fact it is unlikely,
a priori, that the integument at its first origin formed part of the sporangium ; in
that case we should have to regard it not merely as a new formation, but as a structure
absolutely without homologue among Cryptogams, whereas protective outgrowths
from the leaf are common enough among them.

* In Isoetes also, a genus more closely allied to our fossil, the velum forms a kind of integument,
though not much like that of a seed. The narrow opening of the velum in such species as Isoetes Hystrix
was even termed by ALEX. BrAuN the “ micropyle.”
