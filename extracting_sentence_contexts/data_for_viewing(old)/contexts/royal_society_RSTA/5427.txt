America. This was indeed most fortunate since the weight of Prof Koiter’s contribution
could well have discouraged him from proceeding with his own development of the
subject. As it transpired, the full significance of Prof Koiter’s work has filtered slowly
into our consciousness in a gentle stream, moderated by the Dutch language and by our
temperaments which have invariably preferred to explore the field for ourselves. This
having been said, we must nevertheless hasten to admit our deep indebtedness to Prof
Koiter’s work, which we hope is adequately acknowledged in the text.

Koiter later referred to these remarks [12], writing ‘at University College London ... a similar
approach for discrete elastic systems was developed more or less independently, as described so
eloquently in the preface by Thompson and Hunt in their monograph’.

It was, in fact, when I submitted my paper on the basic principles of elastic stability [13] in
1963 to Rodney Hill at Nottingham that he drew my attention, for the first time, to the work of
Koiter, as can be seen in the reproduced first page of his reply in figure 4.

In §5c, we look at another significant aspect of the scientific literature ... it inevitably
contains errors!

Perhaps the most important thing that I should say about the literature is summarized in the
motto of the Royal Society as nullius in verba, which roughly translates into take nobody's word for
it. There is a fair amount of bad, erroneous and downright mischievous material published in
journals and books, so you must be on your guard and develop your own critical faculties.
