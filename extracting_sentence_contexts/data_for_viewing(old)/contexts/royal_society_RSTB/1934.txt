but appears as a series of scattered fibres. On reaching the external boundary of
the pulvinar thalami the fibres form a number of well-marked fasciculi, some of which
end in this structure, but others are continued through it to the outer part of the
anterior quadrigeminal region, into which they are capable of being traced, as
already described (Plate 2, fig. 5).

Upon the distribution of the corticipetal fibres much diversity of opinion exists.

The observations of von Monakow (6) and ViAuer (7) show that the mesial
surface of the occipital lobe stands in relation with the posterior and external parts
of the pulvinar and external geniculate body, while the external occipital convolu-
tions and angular gyrus are similarly related to the superior part of the pulvinar by
means of the upper portion of the optic radiations, facts upon which is based the
conclusion that the optic radiations emerge from both the pulvinar thalami and
external geniculate body, both of which ganglia are therefore in direct relation with
the cortical visual area. The observations of Fiecasic and HENSCHEN, on the other
hand, are opposed to this view. Fiecuste (8), working by the myelination method, has
recently stated that the term “optic radiations” should be limited to the efferent
fibres of the external geniculate body, which he has traced to Vicq p’Azyn’s line in
the lips of the calcarine fissure; while the upper parts of the optic radiations of
GratioLer are formed by the fibres from the pulvinar to the angular gyrus. He,
however, does not consider that the pulvinar thalami forms an internode in the visual
system in man, although it receives a large bundle of fibres from the external
geniculate body.
