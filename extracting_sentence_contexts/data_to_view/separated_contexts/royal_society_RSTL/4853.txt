of the Frog about three hours after impregnation (fig. 10 a), but have not traced |
them to their origin. With regard to the disappearance of the spot in the germinal
vesicle, the facts observed in the ova of the Frog agree with those noticed by Kot-
L1KERÂ® in the ova of intestinal worms, that all appearance of the spot is lost before
that of the vesicle. This circumstance, however, may be owing either to the spot
having given origin to cells in the vesicle which quickly attain to similar dimensions,
and from which it is not otherwise distinguished ; or to its becoming entirely obscured
by their multiplication. Although no observations have been made on the origin of
the embryo vesicle that appears in the yelk after the disappearance of the germinal,
I am till inclined to regard this as being in some way derived from the lost germinal
spot, notwithstanding that K6uker found a certain period of time elapse between the
disappearance of the vesicle and that at which he was able to recognize this body.
