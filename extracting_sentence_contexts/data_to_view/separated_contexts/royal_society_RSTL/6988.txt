If the first be true, the network must be terminal, and impressions must be oral
along the fibre, of which the plexus is but the terminal expansion, direct from peri-
phery to centre. If the second arrangement is correct, the network forms a part of a
continuous circuit or of continuous circuits. I believe the division of the nerves at the
base of the papilla, already adverted to, is alone sufficient to justify us in accepting the
second conclusion as the more probable ; but when this fact is considered with reference
to those which IT have adduced in my paper published in the © Transactions * for 1863,
and that, in the © Proceedings? for June 1864, and the observations published in several
papers in vols. 11., iii., and iv. of my © Archives,” and in the Croonian Lecture for 1865,
T think the general view in favour of complete circuits is the only one which the-anato-
mical facts render tenable.
