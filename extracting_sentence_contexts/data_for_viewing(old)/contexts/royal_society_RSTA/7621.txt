11. THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION OF THE INDUCED GURRE

The inferences, which can be drawn from the above results as to the distribution of
conductivity within the earth, are of course restricted by the fact that the induced

currents will not penetrate (appreciably) beyond a certain depth. In the case of the
extreme theoretical distribution e the currents do not, in fact, penetrate below the
surface of the conducting core. In the other cases considered, the general character
of the induced current distribution has been determined qualitatively in ยง 6.
