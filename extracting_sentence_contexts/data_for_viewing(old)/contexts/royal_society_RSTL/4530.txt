774 MR. BRODIE ON THE CONDITION OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS

case, is a problem which remained to us, and which, in the case of one at least, of
these experiments, it was my hope to solve.

Hitherto, in the breaking up of the oxide of silyer and the peroxide of hydrogen,
no chemical fact has been recognised but the simultaneous decompoxsition of two
chemical substances. This is that fact for which it has been s0 difficult to account.
Were it, for example, a hydride of silver which was thus decomposed and water
formed and not simply oxygen, the experiment would have attracted no attention.
On the view TI have given, the formation of the oxygen itself is as truly a chemical
synthesis as the formation of water, and may be substituted for it in a chemical
change. This supplies an explanation of these facts at once adequate and imple;
the oxide of silver in this experiment being reduced by the oxygen of the peroxide
of hydrogen, just as in other cases it might be by hydrogen; the formation of
the silyer from the particles of which it is composed being the corresponding fact
in the decomposition of the oxide of silyer to the formation of water in the peroxide,
80 that we may represent the change thus :â€”
