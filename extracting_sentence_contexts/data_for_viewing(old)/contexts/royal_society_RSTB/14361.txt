To explore the interrelations between these behavioural
indices, the measures of intelligence and brain size we
first ran bivariate correlations, and then used these to build
multivariate models.

At the genus level, the socioecological complexity index
was significantly correlated with the two indices of general
intelligence (gp-g;: A=0.0, tig = 3.55, p = 0.003, taj = 0.41;
8p-socioecological complexity: A=0.17, t3=2.13, p=0.04,
"aj = 0.13; g,-socioecological complexity: A= 0.67, to7= 2.32,
p =0.03, taj = 0.14). Although g, and socioecological complex-
ity have several measures in common, the fact that r is
similar for both intelligence indices suggests that the corre-
lation with g, cannot be entirely explained by this.
Reproductive cooperation was not correlated with gp (A = 0.09,
fs =2.10, p=0.05, 124, = 0.12) or g, (=0.71, te3=-0.84,
p=0.41, taj = 0.01), suggesting that maintaining pair-
bonded relationships is less cognitively demanding, at least
in primates.

Both g, A=0.97, beta 1.67+0.47, to5=3.54, p=0.002,
aj = 0.31) and socioecological complexity (A =0.0, beta 0.76 +
0.24, tyg = 3.13, p = 0.003, 145 = 0.15) were positively corre-
lated with mean reported group size for each genus.
