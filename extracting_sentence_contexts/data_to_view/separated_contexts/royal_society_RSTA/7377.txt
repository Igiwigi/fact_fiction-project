If
the degree to which the sheet is stretched is the same for all liquids, then rupture strength so
measured will be proportional to the dynamic surface tension of the liquid. If the apparatus
is calibrated with liquids which are known to possess a dynamic surface tension which is
the same as the static surface tension, then the apparatus can be used to measure the dynamic
surface tension of other liquids. Finally, if the rupture strength for any particular liquid is found to be higher than that
determined by its static surface tension then this fact shows that either the dynamic surface
tension is greater than the static value or that the liquid, unlike ordinary liquids, can be
stretched beyond the limits of ordinary liquids or that both conditions are obtaining. By
any of these three mechanisms a higher rupture strength than that determined by the static
surface tension indicates that more energy is being stored in the material under the stressed
condition of flow than under the unstrained static condition. Hence an apparatus was designed on these principles to investigate the characteristics of
these special colloidal systems.
