observations on the absolute expansion of mercury, and on the pressures of steam
between 100° C. and 200° CG. that Reanautr’s temperature scale over this range did
not differ materially from that given by formula (1). It is certain, however, that
ReGNAvuLT was ignorant of the phenomenon of the temporary depression of zero of a
mercury thermometer when heated, and that he was unable to detect any systematic

difference between the mercury and gas scales of temperature over the range 0° C. to
100° C., both of which facts would appreciably affect the reduction of the readings of
the thermometers employed for observing the rise of temperature in the calorimeter.
The correction for these two sources of error combined might reduce Reenaut’s
values by 5 or 6 parts in 1,000 if the thermometers he employed were of French
“eristal” glass. In any case the reduction could hardly be less than 2 or 3 parts in
1,000. This would bring the observations into fairly good agreement with my
extrapolated formula, indicated by the lower curve in fig. 1, but the corrections
involved are so hypothetical that no great stress can be laid on them. The only
satisfactory solution is to repeat the observations, for which I have already made
such preparations as my scant intervals of leisure will permit. In the meantime we
may regard REGNAULT's observations as giving, with some degree of probability, the
rate of increase of the mean specific heat between 100° C. and 200° C., although the
absolute values given by his formula probably require reduction by about 0°4 per cent.
