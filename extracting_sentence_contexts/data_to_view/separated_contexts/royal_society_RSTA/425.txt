At this point it is necessary to consider whether any component displacement, strain
or stress can be discontinuous at an interface; for the argument used in the theory of elasticity,
that discontinuous displacement would entail an infinite strain and therefore stress, plainly

is no longer applicable when (§2) an infinite strain can consist with finite stress. S Continuity of displacement is an assumption, necessary to the progress of this investigation,
‘Which almost certainly is valid in respect of its examples. (We cannot exclude the physical
“Epossibility of finite ‘slip’ at a plastic-elastic interface, but it would seem to be a reasonable
Beonjecture—frequently made in work in soil mechanics—that when such slip occurs the
Zinterface is either straight or circular, and neither is the fact in our solutions.) On that
‘gassumption e,, must be continuous, also the stretch in the direction of the interface. 13.
