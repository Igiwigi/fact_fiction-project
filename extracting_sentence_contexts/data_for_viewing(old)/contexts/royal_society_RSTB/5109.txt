The detailed arrangement of these veins is evidently open to considerable variation
(cf. Lopholatilus), but the distinction of the two systems, particularly with reference
to their mode of entry to the heart, seems to be of a fixed and fundamental character.
The inferior jugular is always connected with the duct of Cuvier, entering the antero-
dorsal aspect of the sinus venosus ; whereas the ventro-subclavian system opens upon
the postero-ventral aspect of the sinus venosus in close association with the hepatic
sinuses.

When the veins of the central parts of the head, pharynx and body-wall of Lophius
are compared with the veins of the same regions in the Loricati, or Lopholatilus, it is
at once apparent that the mode of entry of the vein connected with the thyroid lymph
sinus into the heart is similar to that characteristic of the inferior jugular in those fishes.
The vein is unpaired, but so is the inferior jugular of Lopholatilus. The fact that it
may open into either the right or left duct of Cuvier suggests that it is the survivor of
an original pair of stems similar to those that in the Loricati connect an unpaired
anterior segment of the vessel with the duct of Cuvier of either side. This assumption
is strengthened by the marked asymmetry shown by these two stems of the inferior
jugular in the Loricati.

It is true that the factors that normally compose the inferior jugulars are absent
from this vessel in Lophius, and form tributaries of two other large veins (fig. 2, s.cl.v.)
that lie on either side of the pericardium upon the floor of the pharynx. But these
two veins, apart from their reception of these factors, possess all the characters commonly
associated with the ventro-subclavian system, particularly as regards their mode of
connection with the heart.
