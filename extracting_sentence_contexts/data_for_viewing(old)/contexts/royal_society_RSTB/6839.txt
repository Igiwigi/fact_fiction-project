one stage of low sea-level with the world-wide Pleistocene land emergence of Glacial
times. Vaughan and Daly regard this emergence as due to the withdrawal of water
from the oceans to form the great continental ice-sheets of the period. The submerged
platform and the cliffed coasts would then be due in part (see below) te wave action
during the partial submergence that resulted from the return of the water to the ocean
on deglaciation (in Recent times).

Daly cites the very similar submarine shelf round Barbuda and Antigua (fig. 1)
and that around Anguilla, St Martin and St Bartholomew, which was first inter-
preted by Vaughan, as examples of this cycle of events (Daly 1935, figs. 104, 106).
It seems unnecessary to invoke the hypothetical coral reefs of Davis.

The mature topography and high cliffs of Silver Hill, and the fact that it is largely
formed of solid bandaite with some well-consolidated agglomerate, indicate that from
this volcano a large amount of more superficial, and less consolidated, volcanic material
has been swept away.* This implies erosion that is probably too prolonged and too
profound to be attributed to Pleistocene and Recent times. It seems probable that
the Silver Hill volcano was active either in the Upper Miocene (which, according to
Vaughan, was a period of extensive uplift in the Antillean region), or the early
Pliocene, and that its coastal cliffs are in part due to marine erosion during moderate
submergence in Plio-Pleistocene time.

If the re-entrants in the 100 and 35 fm. contours north-west of Garibaldi Hill
indicate a submerged river valley, it may have been eroded at the time of either Upper
Miocene or Pleistocene emergences. The post-Glacial submergence, according to Daly,
