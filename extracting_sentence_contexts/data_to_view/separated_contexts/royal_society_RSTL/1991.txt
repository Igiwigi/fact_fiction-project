11. When assafcetida was used in a similar experiment, the odour was much
more distinguishable, and it could at once be distinguished by smell, that the
wool had taken up much more of the odour than the cotton. Indeed, from
many experiments I have made to ascertain this fact, wool appears to have a
peculiar attraction for fetid odours, For instance, if, after having allowed
wool to lie in contact with camphor for some time, it be afterwards placed,
even for a very few hours, near a minute portion of snlphuret of barium (which,
it is well known, exhales copiously the fetid odour of sulphuretted hydrogen,)
it quickly loses the camphorous smell, and acquires and even retains in con-
siderable intensity the fetid smell of the sulphuret. It is proper to mention, that in most of these experiments I did not trust to
my own olfactory organs alone. All the members of the family, and several of
my friends, have lent their aid to distinguish between the different intensities of
the odour which each substance had attracted ; and though only a few experi-
ments are here detailed, similar ones have been many times performed, with
various other odorous substances.
