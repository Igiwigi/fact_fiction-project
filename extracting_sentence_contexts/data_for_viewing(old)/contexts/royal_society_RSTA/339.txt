where Dx is a diagonal matrix, specific for each k. That is, the mixing matrices and independent
components are the same for all k up to the scaling factors (and possibly switches of signs) given
by Dx. The differences between the conditions k are thus modelled by the diagonal matrices Dx.
PARAFAC is a major improvement to classical Gaussian factor analysis or PCA in the sense that
it can actually uniquely estimate the components even for Gaussian data. However, there is an
important restriction here, which is that the D, must be linearly independent, which intuitively


means that data matrices must be sufficiently different with respect to the scalings for different k. | 10 |
In fact, if all Dy were equal, the model would reduce an ordinary linear mixing like in (2.2).

A combination of ICA with PARAFAC for estimation of (5.4) was proposed by Beckmann & a
Smith [33], by basically assuming that the S in the PARAFAC model in (5.4) is non-Gaussian, like : s
in ICA. This has the potential of improving estimation from what would be obtained by either ICA is
or PARAFAC alone. Estimation proceeds by considering the matrix 12, and maximizing an ICA : S
objective function under some constraints on the mixing matrix. The constraints on the mixing :gf

matrix are a direct consequence of the definition of PARAFAC. On the other hand, if the data are
non-Gaussian enough, under these assumptions, it might be enough to do ICA on the average
data matrix X = )Â°;_ X;/r to estimate the average mixing matrix and the average components.
Three-way structure is related to a powerful approach to ICA based on joint diagonalization
of covariance matrices. The idea is to estimate a number of covariance matrices, for example, in :
