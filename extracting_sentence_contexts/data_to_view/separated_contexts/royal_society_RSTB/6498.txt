ComPARIsON oF ACANTHODIANS WITH MACROPETALICHTHYS

Macropetalichthys is known from Srensto’s classical account (1925) of the structure of
the neural cranium, and Brot’s (1933 4) excellent description of the whole skeleton. It may be pointed out that the extreme similarity between the neural crania of
Macropetalichthys and an Acanthaspid seems to establish the existence of a real relation-
ship between the groups to which they belong, despite the very great differences in
other parts of the skeleton. STENSIO compares the Macropetalichthid and Elasmobranch neural crania in the
following words: ‘‘(1) The general shape of the primordial neuro-cranium, especially
the tendency to broadening of the ventral surface, partly at the expense of the lateral
surfaces. (This is especially the case in the labyrinth region in which the sacculus and
perhaps the canalis semicircularis externus had about the same relation to the ventral
surface as in Chlamydoselachus and most other Selachians.) (2) The position and
relations of the olfactory capsule. (3) The presence of a nasal fontanelle on the lower
side of the nasal capsule as in Chlamydoselachus and certain other Selachians. (4) The
presence of the cavum precerebrale. (5) The general shape of the labyrinth, especially.
with regard to the position of certain of its main parts, as, for instance, the utriculus.
(6) The presence of the ductus endolymphaticus and the fact that there probably was
a distinct fossa endolymphatica on the dorsal surface of the primordial neuro-cranium
beneath the dermal bones. (7) The fact that the ductus endolymphaticus perforated
