The separation of 0-45 cm.~! should then be connected with the
spin fine structure of the 42 state. From this point a search for additional branches
and an attempt to identify those already found by means of the combination relations
were carried on simultaneously. Fortunately, in many cases the probable J values of
the lines could be established directly from the fact that the branches could be followed
close up to the origin. When the analysis had been partly completed Budo’s paper (1937)
appeared confirming tentative conclusions on the structure of the #2’ state. With the
confidence thus inspired it did not take long to identify the remaining branches found
empirically and to calculate the positions of the lines of the weak branches with the
aid of the combination relations.
