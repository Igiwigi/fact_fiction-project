long before this, the absence of ray tracheids in the Araucarinere must be
palingenetic. When the thin and unpitted character of the walls of the ray cells
is also taken into account, it is evident that the ray cells are of primitive type.
In fact they are identical with the Cordaitean and much more primitive than those
of the Abietinez.

7. Bast anp PERIDERM.

The bast in Agathis and Araucaria, according to SrraspurGER (1891, IIT), has no
albuminous cells associated with the rays. These he considers as the counterparts in
the bast of the ray tracheids in the wood, and finds that in exceptional cases only are
they not continuous with ray tracheids. Some of these cases have been explained by
the fact that the ray tracheids which were ancestrally present have been lost.f The
absence of the marginal medullary ray cells from the bast of the Araucarinew (and
Taxiner), STRASBURGER (1891, III, pp. 92-93) considers evidence of their primitive
structure. It is certainly almost in the nature of a demonstration that these forms
have had no connection with the Abietinez after the latter had developed ray
tracheids and albuminous marginal medullary ray cells. A study of the bast of the
Conifers is perhaps more urgently needed at present than that of any other feature.
I have found no albuminous cells in Podocarps which I have examined, and it would
seem as if this might be another feature which divides the Abietineous alliance of the
Conifers from the Araucarian. (See Section 4a.)

Periderm is of relatively late development in the Araucarian stem. In the root it
