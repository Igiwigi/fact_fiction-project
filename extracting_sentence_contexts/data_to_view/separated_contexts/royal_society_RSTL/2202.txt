In adopting the hypothesis of induced magnetism in the
Second Edition of my Essay, I only attempted the calculation
for an indefinitely short needle, or magnetic particle. Since
this M. Potss0x has, by means-of the powerful analysis he
knows 80 well how to apply, obtained a general formula for
a needle of any length ; and I haye little doubt, if we pos-
sessed the means of estimating the amount of deterioration,
or the actual inequality of magnetism in the two branches of
the needle, that all the facts I have stated would become by
his formula a subject for calculation,

The following experiments may perhaps in some measure
assist towards rendering the results numerical : they were
undertaken after the preceding part of the paper had been
written on the suggestion of Captain BEAvroRT. Three needles were procured from Messrs. W. and T.
