a succession of moderately good nights, when a great deal of work was done, await-
ing a night when the air was in a state to warrant a decisive opinion. Such a spe-
culum might do good work, but it would not resolve difficult nebulz, neither would
it bring out faint points of light, even when wide apart. There is still another cause
of the unequal action of our specula far more serious, the varying state of the atmo-
spbere. When the air is unsteady, minute stars are no longer points, the diffused
image is much fainter, and single stars, easily seen when the air is steady, are no
longer visible. When many minute stars are crowded together the whole become
blended, and instead of a resolyed nebula we have merely a diffased, perhaps bright
nebulosity. The transparency of the air varies also quite as much ; and the aspect of
the nebulze changes from night to night, just as the appearance of a distant building
alters as the details of the architecture are more or less obscured by the intervening
mist. With these facts, the Society will not be surprised should it be in our power at
a future time to communicate some additional particulars, even as to the nebulze
which have been the most frequently obseryed.

The sketches which accompany this paper are on a very small scale, bat they are
sufficient to convey a pretty accurate idea of the peculiarities of structure which have
gradually become known to us: in many of the nebulz they are very remarkable,
and seem even to indicate the presence of dynamical laws we may perhaps fancy to
be almost within our grasp. To have made full-sized copies of the original sketches
would have been useless, as many micrometrical measures are still wanting, and there
are many matters of detail to be worked in before they will be entitled to rank as
astronomical records, to be referred to as evidence of change, should there hereafter
be any reason to suspect it.
