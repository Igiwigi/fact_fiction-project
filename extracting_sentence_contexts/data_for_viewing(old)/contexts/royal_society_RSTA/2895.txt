only greyscale (panchromatic) imagery, suggesting that the characteristics of the settlement are a
much more important factor for accuracy of structure detection than the availability of multi-band
colour images.

The extent to which adaptation data helped detection accuracy is shown for sample settlements
in figure 3, where we zoom in on the high-precision, high-recall area of each curve and show the
different between the basenet and each of the adapted nets. For some settlements, adaptation data
give a strong improvement; other less so, and sometimes with accuracy in fact decreasing. Note
that for each quantity of adaptation data, the test set changes each time (as we only evaluate on
parts of the settlement which were not used for adaptation training). Hence the performance is
not guaranteed to increase with increasing adaptation data.

Figure 4 illustrates these results by showing detections for one sample tile in Doro settlement.
The basenet is unable to detect several of the structures, because there are structures with
appearances particular to this settlement. With a small amount of adaptation data, these false
negatives are corrected. Figure 5 shows detections across the extent of an entire settlement,
compared to ground truth locations. Although some false positives are evident, the overall
structure of the settlement is clearly detected. Post-processing to remove outliers is likely to
improve results further.
