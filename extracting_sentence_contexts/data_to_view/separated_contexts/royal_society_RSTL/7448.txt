The most careful and prolonged examination of the swbstance of the discus
 proligerus, more particularly of that part of it which had s0 recently contained the
germinal vesicle, failed to show any trace of the germinal spots, or any other change in the
structure or reactions of the matter of the discus proligerus, after the germinal vesicle
"had vanished, which could be looked on as due to its disappearance. In face of this
negative result, however, it may be mentioned that in cases where I watched the germinal
Jeiicle escape through a rupture in the yelk-sac into the surrounding fluid, whether
ater was present or not, it often happened that the vesicle was ruptured and its contents
2scaped; and when this did occur, I frequently could not see the spots among the sur-
ounding materials if, perchance, they were lost sight of for a few minutes. This was
Moubtless due, in part, to the fact that all the objects in the field were in a state of con-
Stant change; till, the changes which occur in the germinal spots are such as might
Biatinguiah them from the only visible elements of the formative yelk which can be com-
red with them, viz. the yellow droplets; for these latter vacuolate, fade, and disappear
--5n water, while the former vacuolate and become darker in outline and do not disappear,
At least for a very long time, in water. Perhaps the saline or other constituents of the
Ik-ball may have a solvent action on the germinal vesicle or spots; but this point,
Ep hich might be snbmitted to experiment, I had not an opportunity of determining.
