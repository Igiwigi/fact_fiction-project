Note also that in those cages where the maximum induction is low, the residual
magnetism is proportionately lower still, but that the coercive force is not uniformly
lower, This is in accordance with the supposition that these samples are to be
regarded as mechanical mixtures of a strongly magnetic substance, such as ordinary
iron or steel, and a non-magnetic substance, &uch as manganese steel with 12 per
cent. of manganese. A feature present in all the curves may some day hays &
bearing on the molecular theory of magnetism. Tb is this : the ascending curve tw1Ce
croszes the continuation of the descending curve; in other words, the fact that a
ample has been strongly magnetised in a reverse direction, renders it for small forces,
or for large forces, more difficult to magnetise than a virgin sample, but distinetly
casier for intermediate forces. This is best seen in the case of the hardesb steel,
No. IX., fig. 9, in which the two curves ent in the points marked M, N.
