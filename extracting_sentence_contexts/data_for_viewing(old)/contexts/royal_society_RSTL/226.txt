quantities of silver ores, and even specimens of native silver,
yet, hitherto, no instance had been known of their yielding
this precious metal in such abundance ; nor had any circum-
stances, in the natural history of the mineral veins of this coun-
try, borne any analogy to those which accompanied the present
discovery.

These circumstances therefore, having been examined with
more attention than usual, shall be stated with as much preci-
sion as it is possible to obtain, from the report of those practical
miners only who have hitherto inspected them.

The facts which deserve to be first noticed are, the confined and
insulated position of the mass of silver ore; its great depth from
the surface of the mine; and its contiguity to a copper lode.

The lode in which it occurs is one of those cross courses, as
they are here called, which intersect and derange the copper
lodes, and consequently are of a more recent formation.

\Lodes in this direction are usvally filled with quartz, but
frequently produce galena; and sometimes, instead of galena,
