Part V. exhibits the strength of plates to resist vertical pressure from a blunt in-
strument, which was forced through them for the purpose of ascertaining their com-
parative powers of resistance with oak timber, placed under circumstances precisely
similar and snhjected to the same force. The results are interesting, as the iron
plates appear to follow a different law in their resistance to pressure to that of oak,
the strength being as the depth or thickness of the plates in the first case, and as
the squares of the depth in the second. The resistances are therefore in the ratio of
1:12, the iron being 12 times stronger than oak.

In Part IV. we have some curious facts illustrative of the necessity and value of ex-
perimental research. In the earlier experiments of the inquiry it is evident, that angle
and T iron beams or frames are not the best, as regards form, to resist a transyerse
strain. In every case they are weak, and although exceedingly useful, and in fact
indispensable for many purposes of construction, they are nevertheless not calculated
to resist strain in the form of beams or girders. These defects I have endeavoured to
obviate by the introduction of beams with double flanges formed of a body plate and
riveted angle-irons at the top and bottom. All these latter constructions may how-
ever be left with safety to the practical engineer F.

The strengths of nearly the whole of these beams have been mathematically inves-
tigated by Mr. Tars, to whose friendship and analytical research I am indebted for
the annexed mathematical inquiry into the different forms of the wrought-iron beams
which have been experimented upon. To the mathematician this part of the subject
will be the more interesting, as the utmost care has been obseryed in the measurements
