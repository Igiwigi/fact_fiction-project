Here (2.1) states that the medians from b to (ac) and
from a to j(bc) meet in the point 0, which divides ay(bc) and by(ac) in the ratio 2:1 (vertex:
midpoint). Here a stands for o(a(o(bc))o). The picturesque geometric statement we provided
should, however, be taken with a grain of salt, as there is no mention of the fact that the vertices
of our ‘triangle’ are not collinear. The statements Al and A2 are making is plain, while A3 states
that the midline of a triangle is half as long as the basis (in triangle abc, the segment j1(ab) (ac)
joining the midpoint of ab with that of ac is half as long as bc), which is equivalent in Hilbert’s
absolute geometry to the statement that there exists a rectangle (or that the sum of the angles of a
triangle is two right angles). That this is possible at all is not a discovery made by a human, but rather by Tipi, an aggregate
of several automatic theorem provers [12], as reported in [13].
