BRONGNIART many years ago obtained some silicified
stems of Calamites from the Coal-measures of Autun, which showed that the woody
wedges took their rise from narrow pores or canals. Mr. BixxEy has further demon-
strated the same fact in his memoir, but was doubtful respecting their nature. He says
that Dr, Hooker, © after carefully examining these openings, I believe, came to the con-
clusion that they were passes for a peculiar kind of tissue which has unfortunately been
destroyed, rather than the mere cavities which we now see in the specimens” (7c. ct. P- 20).
