A similar change physical mechanism for vocal learning. Thus, laryngeal
(flattening of 0.27 dB/octave) in spectral tilt occurs in human plasticity and vocal flexibility may provide indirect evidence

fo is a major feature shaping human singing and speech
production. Frequency modulations may be physiologically
more demanding to perform than temporal or amplitude
modulations; in fact, several anatomical and dynamic fea-
tures affect fo, such as length, tension and stiffness of the
vocal folds [38,76]. Therefore, controlling fo requires neuro-
muscular control over several anatomical _ structures
whereas duration and amplitude of a sound are mostly con-
trolled by modifications of exhalation. In humans, vocal learning requires control—mediated by
the laryngeal motor cortex—over multiple phonatory struc-
tures linked to both the source and the filter [77,78].
