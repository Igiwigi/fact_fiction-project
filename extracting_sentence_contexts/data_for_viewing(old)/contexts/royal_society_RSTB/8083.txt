Figure 2. Manipulation of natural population dynamics of social behaviour to reduce virulence of bacterial infection. The top
row of mice represents the initial population of hosts which are infected with either wild-type (W in green) or cheat (C in red)
strains of bacteria. The arrows represent transmission to new hosts, represented by the lower row of mice. (a) Illustrates the fact
that wild-type strains are more productive and better at transmission and colonization of new hosts. This promotes the main-
tenance of cooperative behaviour in the global population: even though cheats can outcompete wild-type strains within hosts,
groups containing only wild-type will be more productive and more likely to spread to new hosts (this requires that wild-
type and cheats tend to be in different hosts—high relatedness). (5) Illustrates how inoculation of hosts containing wild-type
infections with cheater strains can counteract the natural population dynamics of cooperators and cheats.
