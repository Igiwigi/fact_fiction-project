ZUCKERMAN AND P. L. KROHN ON

Type I—Little need be said about the structure of appendages of this kind beyond
the fact that they comprise minute tag-like condensations of fibro-muscular tissue
whose covering of flattened epithelial cells, which is continuous with the visceral layer
of the tunica vaginalis, sometimes appears to be deficient. Type 1I—Hydatids of this type are usually attached to the antero-lateral margin of
the epididymis. When present in conjunction with an appendage belonging to
Type II or Type IV they are more caudally disposed on the epididymis.
