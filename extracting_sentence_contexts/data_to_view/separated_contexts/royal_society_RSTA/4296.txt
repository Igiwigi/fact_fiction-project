It is this delicate balance of robust and optimizable functionality with capacity for innovation
that makes Darwinian evolution possible. This morphology of the phase space is not unique to
proteins and DNA, but applies also to metabolic networks [43] and gene regulatory networks [44]. In fact, it seems to be a general property of complex systems made from permutable elements, and
not even unique to biology [45], implying that it is instead an aspect of how complex information
is naturally organized—albeit one that is as yet poorly understood.

5. Where does causation reside? A lack of understanding of the ‘logic of life’ [46] leaves many other important questions
unanswered in terms of how DNA fulfils its roles in both development and evolution.
