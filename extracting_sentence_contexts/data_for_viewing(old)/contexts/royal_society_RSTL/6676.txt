annealed wires, and see how well they agree with each other. Tt appears, however, to
be probably due to the molecular arrangement of the wires being different in each case.
Take, for instance, the copper wires experimented with : wire 1 increased in conducting
power by heating to 100? for seyeral days, almost to the same extent as if it had been
annealed, wire 2 partially 80, and wire 3 hardly at all; and here it may be mentioned
that silyer and copper wires become softer and lose their elasticity, whereas gold does not
seem to be annealed at all after having been kept at 100? for several days. Again, take
cadmium, where we know that the wires become brittle and crystalline at 80?, and we find
the formulze vary more than those of any other metals; and, lastly, look at the results
obtained with bismuth and tellurium, and there can be little doubt that the reason why
the formule of the wires and bars of the same metal do not agree together is that the
molecular arrangement is different in each ; and that this is the cause of the differences
in the formule, we may also assume from the fact that, when the wires on being heated
do not at all or only to a yery slight degree permanently alter in their conducting power,
when cooled again, then the formule of wires of the same metal agree yery closely with
each other, Compare, for instance, those of lead, tin, mercury, &c.


TEMPERATURE ON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF METALS, 27

The mean of the conducting powers given in the Tables agrees very well with the
mean of the former determinations made with wires of metals of different preparation to
that of those used for the experiments described in this paper.

The following questions have suggested themselyes during the foregoing investigation,
