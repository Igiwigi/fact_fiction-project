They are
interesting for comparison with O. struthiopteris in which the order of succession is
also basipetal, while the number of sporangia may be larger. In the latter Fern,
numerous immature sporangia may be seen clustering round the base of the receptacle,
at a time when the majority of those seated higher are mature. There is no evidence
of intercalation of young sporangia between the older ones, in fact, the mode of
development of the sorus is like that of the Cyathew, and especially Hemitelia. But when the sporangium itself is examined the correspondence with Cyathea is
not borne out in detail; a definite regularity of orientation of the sporangia is
certainly suggested by the section shown in fig. 90,
