Figure 7. HAPPI-based assessment of differences of changes in regional climate extremes between 1.5°C and 2°C of global
warming: significant increases are shown in red, significant decreases are shown in blue and non-significant changes are shown
in grey. See figure 2 for regions’ acronyms.

there seems to be a slight tendency for the ESR-CMIP5 estimates to display a broader spread
(interquartile range) than the HAPPI estimates. This may reflect the fact that the ESR-CMIP5
estimates are based on a larger number of ESMs (§§2a and 2b), and also that the HAPPI set-up
does not take into account uncertainty of climate changes in the oceans, since it prescribes a
uniform change in SSTs compared to the considered present-day decade.

Hence, we can conclude from these analyses that changes in temperature and water cycle
extremes based on the ESR-CMIP5 approach for the considered indices should be generally robust
compared to analyses using time slice experiments with forced SSTs consistent with the given
investigated levels of global warming, although there are a few exceptions.
