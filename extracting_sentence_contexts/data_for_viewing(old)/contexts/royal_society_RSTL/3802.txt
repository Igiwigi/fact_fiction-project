pellucid centre for future change. We here again find a process in operation, bear-
ing a striking resemblance to that producing tissues.—Compare with fig. 147,

100. Where the supply of nutriment goes on, this process of self-division, and the
formation of new solid substance, are continued until an entire tissue is produced.
Where that supply is s00n exhausted, as in coagulating blood, the process in question
is speedily at an end. But here also, as in the tissues, greater firmness is acquired as
new substance forms. When the supply of nutriment is exhausted, there is no longer
a renovation of the nucleus: and now there is seen a cavity (fig. 152 «), This appear-
ance is very frequent in the adyanced clot.

101. The best delineations I have met with of coagulated blood, are those by G.
GuLaverJ. They are to be explained, I believe, by the facts above mentioned: as
well as those given by the same obseryer of morbid growths; which, like healthy
tissues, have their origin in corpuscles of the blood ||.

102. In the blood-clot, corpuscles are scen of a much minuter size than those usn-
ally circulating in the animal, Such corpuscles are constantly met with in the clot
of the Frog and Newt. They owe their origin to previous corpuscles; a filament is
often to be seen within them ; they are frequently membranous at the surface ; more
or less spherical in form ; and generally of a deep red colour.

103. In a former paper, when describing the origin of the various structures of the
body in corpuscles of the blood, I mentioned having noticed a reproduction of red
