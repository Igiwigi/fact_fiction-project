where we have introduced the average Hamiltonian H:=(H'+H")/2 and the difference
Hamiltonian (or perturbation) AH := H” — H’. Note that, for simplicity, we have for the moment
used one-dimensional notation, and moreover, as both H’ and H” are separable in coordinates
and momenta, so are H and AH, and expressions such as (d"H(x)/dx")(Ax)" stand for
(a"T(p)/dp")(Ap)” + (8"V(q)/0q")(Aq)", etc. There are two important observations to make.

First, in the Ax expansion (3.11), derivatives of the average Hamiltonian H appear only with
odd powers of Ax and derivatives of the perturbation AH appear only with even powers of Ax.
Second, the average Hamiltonian appears naturally and plays a prominent role. The average
Hamiltonian must be used in order to preserve the order of the expansion. Otherwise (e.g. if
H' were used as a reference in displaced harmonic oscillators) what appears to be a first-order
expansion in Ax would in fact be of second order. This has a consequence, explained below in
§4, that in displaced harmonic oscillators, the dephasing representation (1.2) mentioned in the
introduction is exact if the average Hamiltonian H is used as reference, but not if H’ is used
instead (see equation (4.3)).

It turns out to be useful to truncate expansion (3.11) at increasing powers of Ax. As we will see
later, both the zeroth- and first-order expansions yield simple analytical results, the latter agreeing
exactly with the dephasing representation. The second-order expansion cannot be solved fully
analytically, but nevertheless yields an appealing extension of the dephasing representation.
