For example,
Experiments 130, 131, 135, and 134 show that, when the two pulleys are both taken
into account, the calculated speed is much too low. Hence we may infer that if
Pulley I (which is the lighter of the two) be placed on the far side of the centre of
its span from the middle bearing, its effect on the whirling speed is very small. The
whirling speed may, in fact, be taken as that resulting from the combined effects
of the heavier pulley and the shaft. On this assumption, the calculated whirling
speeds in the above four experiments would be (see § 44, Experiments 110, 109) 3056,
3056, 2600 and 2600 respectively, and the percentage errors would be + 5, + 6°2,
+7, and + 3°4, instead of + 4°4, + 8°7, + 4°7, and + 6°4,

46. The discrepancies between the observed and calculated results are accounted
for by the fact that the empirical formula—viz., N,N./,/(N,? + N,°)—upon which the
resulting calculated speeds are based, is not strictly accurate.
