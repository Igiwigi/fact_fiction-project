the relation between stomata and
transpiration, is but briefly illustrated in the paper. Only a single experiment was
given to show the parallelism which occurs between the variations in aperture of the
stomata and in the rate of transpiration. In the present essay I hope to establish
the fact that this parallelism holds good within certain limits. There are, indeed,
frequent irregularities in the experiments, as disturbing causes cannot be avoided ;
but when the general correspondence between the results of a large number of .
experiments is considered, it seems to me impossible to accept Luoyn’s dictum* with
regard to stomata—that “ their regulatory function is almost ni/.” It must in justice
be said that he elsewhere modifies this sweeping assertion. He allows (p. 35) that
“complete closure of the stomata, if this occurs, reduces transpiration to, or nearly to,
cuticular rate.”
