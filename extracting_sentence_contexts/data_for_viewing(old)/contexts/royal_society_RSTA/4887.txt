According to the observations 2.1 and 2.2, the streaking artefacts occur by way of minimizing
the mismatch between projection and a Radon transform of monochromatic image. With this
wavefront set point of view, the streaking artefacts are produced to compensate for the abrupt
mismatch between projection data and Radon transform of fg,.

3. Experiments and suggestions

Being used for imaging subjects containing high attenuation materials, a dual detector CT
(Discovery CT750 HD, GE Healthcare, USA) is used to see the influence of beam-hardening
artefacts. For a given polychromatic X-ray source, the absolute value of dfÂ¢/dE|g, at an effective
energy Ep is the major factor of beam hardening. The main difficulty in reducing beam-hardening
artefacts comes from the fact that the discrepancy between the projection P and fg is related to
the geometry of D. It is because the intensities of the projection data do not change linearly
with the thickness of D. Figure 7 illustrates virtual monochromatic images using dual energy
CT. The beam-hardening artefacts are seen in figure 7b, although the monochromatic image, in

Figure 6. Illustration of streaking artefacts owing to high-attenuation objects (iron) being two circular rings occupying
D=D, U D). If the smaller ring D, is placed inside the larger ring D,, it does not produce streaking artefacts. On the other
hand, if D; is placed outside D,, the streaking artefacts occur along the tangent lines to both of 0D; and D). In this simulation,
