During the succeeding winter, the natural buds of the golden
pippin branches were destroyed, and those inserted suffered
alone to remain; and as 800n as the leaves of these had
unfolded, and entered on their office, every symptom of
debility and disease disappeared in the bark and wood of the
golden pippin ; and each continued to perform its office, just
as well as the wood and bark of the young scedling stocks
could have done under similar circumstances. I made nearly
the same experiments on the pear tree, and with the same
result. I have endeavoured, in several former communications, to
prove that the sap of plants circulates through their leaves,
as'the blood of animals circulates through their lungs ; and I
have not subsequently found any facts, in the writings of
other naturalists, or in my own experiments, which militate
against this conclusion. I have also obseryed, that grafted

trees, of old and debilitated varieties of fruit, became most
diseased in rich soils, and when grafted on stocks of the
most vigorous growth ; which has induced me to suspect,
that in such cases more food is collected, and carried up into
the plant, than its leaves can prepare and assimilate, and that
the matter thus collected, which would have promoted the
health and growth in a vigorous variety, accumulates, and
generates disease in the extremities of the branches and
annual $shoots, whilst the lower part of the trunk and roots
remain, generally, free from any apparent disease.
