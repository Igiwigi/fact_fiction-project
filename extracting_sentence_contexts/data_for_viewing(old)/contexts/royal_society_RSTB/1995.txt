(4.) Cytological Differences between the Sporophyte and Gametophyte.

It has been shown in recent years that accompanying the more obvious distinctions
between the two generations a difference in their nuclei could be detected during
karyokinesis. In the examples of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms, and
Angiosperms which have been investigated, the number of chromosomes was twice as
large in the nuclei of the sporophyte as on those of the corresponding gametophyte.
The facts are collected in a paper by Srrassurcer,* and their bearing on alternation

has been considered by Bower* and Scorrt, among others. It is, therefore, only
necessary to consider in what degree they lend support to the theories of antithetic
or homologous alternation. The relation of the nuclear differences to normal alter-
nation are in such natura] accord with the view that the sporophyte is an interpolated
stage in the life-history, that Srraspurcer was led on these grounds to adopt a
theory of alternation, essentially the same as that previously arrived at by Bowzr, by
