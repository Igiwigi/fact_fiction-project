As another control the “ Erdschreiber” culture 7a may be mentioned which was started
on 5 June with fifteen cells and contained after a week:

638 vegetative cells
9 cells forming auxospores
0 auxospores
647
This experiment shows that diatoms with.a diameter of about 20, (see fig. 27) not
only divide very slowly in sea water as compared with “‘Erdschreiber” but that
auxospore formation begins sooner, within a day in sea water, after 7 days in “‘ Erd-
schreiber”. The degree of ‘‘overcrowding” necessary to induce auxospore formation
is obviously much smaller in sea water. This may, perhaps, be explained by the
fact that “‘Erdschreiber” contains a much greater amount of nutrient substances
than sea water. One might compare sea water with uncultivated soil and ‘‘ Erd-
schreiber” with manured garden soil.

On 23 May 100 cells of line C were placed in sterile sea water (a), twenty cells
from the same culture in ‘“‘Erdschreiber” (b). On 27 May not a single auxospore
