Fic. 4.—Different Pulses (Subsequent and Previous Reversed) for Various Groups of Years.

pulse that any difference appears in the interval, and in that case it is the high spot
latitude years that supply the shorter interval! ‘The maximum falls on day 81 in the
case of the low spot latitude years, but the excess on day 81 over day 80 is hardly
convincing. Thus, while a difference appears between the years of low and high spot
latitude, in the direction opposite to expectations, it is small, only a fraction of a day.
The difference, such as it is, tends to be discounted by the fact that the fourth secondary
pulses from, both groups of years have their crests on day 108.

It is the group of years of few sunspots that gives a crest most clearly on day 81,
and the third secondary pulse is much better developed in this case than in any other.
The group of years of many sunspots give very irregular results for both the third and
fourth secondary pulses.

As Table VII shows, there is no great difference between the amplitudes of the
primary pulses for the years of low and high spot latitude, but the latter is rather the
