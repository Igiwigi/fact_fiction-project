9, appear loose and detached ; but in a second section which I have obtained they are
all compactly united as in ordinary parenchyma, and as seen in the lower part of
fig. 131. Many of these cells have a mean diameter of 006, which is half as large
again as those of C. anomalum, represented in fig. 120. This Cardiocarpon differs from
all those of which I can discover any published account. I have therefore given to it
the name of C. Butterworthii, as a memorial of the valuable aid which its discoverer
has rendered me, by supplying me with specimens of the Oldham fossils, as well as by
his quickness in detecting new forms and his skill in preparing sections of them.

Figs. 132, 133, & 134 represent three seeds from a slab of shale from Swinehill Col-
liery, near Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, for which I am indebted to Joun Youxs, Esq., of
the Glasgow Hunterian Museum*. The seeds are scattered over seyeral large slabs of
shale in great numbers, no two of them being exactly alike, save in the fact that they
are all compressed, as well as more or less fluted longitudinally. They also exhibit the
appearance of a surrounding margin ; but I suspect that this may merely have been a
result of pressure acting upon a thick testa, which would resist that pressure where it
was folded back upon itself. These seeds appear to me to agree with the figure and
description given by Dr. Dawsox of his Cardiocarpum tenellumf. T scarcely think that

# Mr. YouxG informs me that these specimens were discovered by Mr. Jonx SarrTn, of Stables, Kilwinning,
in Ayrshire, The coal from the roof of which they were obtained is the Virtue-Well coal, one of the seams of
the upper series of Coal-measures.
