In flocks of starlings, for example,
human groups, it is shown that the amount of information one can observe ‘scale-free correlations’, which occur on all
collected at the individual scale deeply affects the collective possible length scales in the flock [116]. This hallmark of criti-
separation dynamics. However, they also show that each indi- cality is characterized by the fact that the velocity fluctuations
vidual must only acquire a minimum amount of information of two distant birds mutually influence each other. The same

of segregation. In fact, the results show that the acquisition of aggregation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum in
