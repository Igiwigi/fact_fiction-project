This is consistent with the finding that pro- alone is sufficient to cause a toxic effect on other cells.
duction of B310 is sufficient to block inhibition by the Growth curves of SSV9 B310 overexpression strains show
supernatant of RJW004/pOE-B310 (figure 2d). In addition to that expression of this gene incurs a growth cost. Specifically,
uninfected cell lawns, supernatant from RJW004/pOE- the cost of harbouring the toxin is in fact quite similar to the
SSV11p29 and RJW004/pOE-SSV11p29&p30 cell cultures cost of infection that is seen in the SSV9 chronically infected

caused zones of inhibition on lawns of the SSV14-infected strain [17]. We hypothesize that production of this secreted


toxin may be responsible for the cost of infection. While the C8, a toxin produced by certain strains of haloarchaea,

identity of an associated antitoxin is still missing, the ability is cleaved into a short secreted toxic peptide and a large
of strains harbouring SSV9 B310, SSV11 p29 and SSV13 p30 immunity protein [31].
