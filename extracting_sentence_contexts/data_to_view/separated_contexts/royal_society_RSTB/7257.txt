This argument raises an interesting point, namely, the nature of the attribute which
causes the selection of a particular retinal area to act as the fixation point. It would not be
unreasonable to expect that this point would lie on the optic axis of the lens system of the
eye because the definition here would probably be higher than it is elsewhere. But such an
expectation is contrary to the facts. The fixation point is usually situated to the temporal
side of the axial point, but varies greatly in position in different people. Tscherning (1904)
put the matter as follows: ‘Calling the imaginary line which joins the posterior nodal point
with the fixation point “the fixation axis” then this line makes with the optic axis the angle
alpha which varies usually from 4 to 7° horizontally, and from 2 to 3° vertically’ (see
Part VII).
