One
point, perhaps, worth mentioning is that the rabbit furnishes an additional piece of
evidence to refute Gaupr’s view, in that the parachordal plate is just as broad in front
as behind. It is only in the intermediate region that it is narrower, which narrowing
Gaupp attempted to attribute to the appropriation of the lateral part of the parachordal
by the auditory capsule to form its cochlear portion, and he based this view on forms
in which the front of the parachordal plate happened to be narrower than it was at the
back. This was, of course, merely due to the fact that in those forms the cochlear
capsules were situated relatively further forward than they are in the rabbit. The Parietal Plate-—The development of the structures forming the wall of the hinder
part of the chondrocranium, above the auditory capsules, agrees in Felis, Talpa, and
Lepus, except in regard to the times at which these originally separate cartilages become
connected with one another. VOL.
