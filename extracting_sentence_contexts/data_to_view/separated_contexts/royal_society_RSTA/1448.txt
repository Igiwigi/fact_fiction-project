From data we extract ;
information, from information we extract knowledge and finally from knowledge we distil the
ultimate goal: Wisdom, the ability to do the ‘right thing’ (figure 4). BD-driven decision theory is obviously of paramount importance to science, business and
society, as it is to each of our private lives. But, as a matter of fact, the ‘constitutive relation’
between Data and Information, Information versus Knowledge and Knowledge versus Wisdom is
not well known, to put it mildly. In the following, we shall argue that the pyramid representation
is deceptive, for it conveys the idea that the layers stand in a simple linear relationship to one
another, which is by no means the case. More importantly, it suggests that by expanding the
basis (data) all upper-lying layers will expand accordingly, whence the mantra: more data, more
wisdom.
