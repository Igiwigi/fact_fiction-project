Zocean. To approximate to this is the object of the present Paper.

2. The geographical position of Hindostan is somewhat remarkable. 'The highest
>mountain-ground in the world lies to the north of it; and an unbroken expanse of ocean
Sextends from its shores down to the neighbourhood of the south pole. The excess of
matter presented by the first canses a deflection of the plumb-line towards the north,
Fdecreasing in amount as we travel southwards. The deficiency of matter arising from
Sthe 8econd causes a deflection of the plumb-line also towards the north, but decreasing
gin amount as we travel northwards. The consequence is, that while these two causes
#conspire to increase the deflection at the different stations, their combined action tends
Bto reduce in amount the errors the mountain attraction causes in the amplitudes.
SBut the attraction of the mountains northwards, and the deficiency of attraction of the
Socean southwards, which last is in fact equivalent to a repulsive force northwards, com-
Abine to produce another effect upon the measures of the Survey besides the deflection

of the plumb-line, an effect of some importance. They have a sensible influence in
changing the sea-level, s0 as to make the level of Karachi—to which a great longitudinal
chain of triangles is brought down from Kalianpur in the centre of India—many feet
higher than the level at Punnce, near Cape Comorin, the south extremity of the Great
Arc of meridian.

3. If the density of the sea were the same as that of the superficial stratum of rock,
there would be no disturbing force. The deficiency of matter arising from the smaller
density of the ocean, produces, therefore, a northerly repulsive force exactly equal "n w-
attraction of a mass of the same form in superficial extent and depth, but having a
