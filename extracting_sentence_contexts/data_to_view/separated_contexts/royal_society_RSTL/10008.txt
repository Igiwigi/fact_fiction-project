T took for granted the explanation usually given, founded on Briicks's experiments. I had not become
acquainted with the then recently-publizhed researches of Prerrer on the excitability of plants
(f Physiologische Untersnehungen,‚Äù yon Dr. W. Prerysr, Leipzig : 1873). As regards the original experiments by which 1 demonstrated the fact that the leaf of Dionwa responds
to excitation by an electrical disturbance analogous to the excitatory variation of muscle, Professor MuxK's


8 PROFESSOR B. SANDERSON ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE

The researches of KUNKEL,* like those of MuxKk, have been directed to two
questions, viz. : to that of the differences of electric tension which present themselves
in the uninjured leaf, and to the electromotive phenomena which follow excitation in
the excitable organs of plants, As regards the firs question, he has found that in
leaves generally, when they are led off by non-polarizable electrodes in the usual way,
differences of tension present themselves, these being always of such a nature that if
one electrode is in contact with a vein, the other with the green surface between the
veins, the former is positive to the latter (p. 359). But he considers this due, not
to any real difference of tension between the surfaces, but exclusively to inhibition
changes which begin at the moment that contact is made.
