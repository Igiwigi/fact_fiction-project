1e system spends most of its precipitating time near the transition to
convection, as predicted by QE.

The precipitation variance, shown in figure 6a (the four middle curves), is an
indicator of the susceptibility of the system. A high intrinsic variance (and

1erefore susceptibility) near the QE state is expected if the QE state can be
identified with the critical point of a continuous phase transition. The observed
variance peaks near the critical point identified from the order parameter pickup
ensemble-average precipitation pickup, also shown in figure 6a). In principle,

1is could be the result of unresolved variations in water vapour or other
variables, coupled with the fact that precipitation changes most rapidly here.
The theory of critical phenomena, however, suggests high variance to be an
intrinsic property of the system which is not due to insufficient measurement
resolution. Figure 6b shows the event-size distribution for the Nauru ARM site

Event size is proportional to the energy released and has clear analogues in other
