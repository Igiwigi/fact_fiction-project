column of humid air 38 inches long absorbs, according to these experiments,
per cent. of the radiation from a hydrogen flame. IT have been criticiged for
ating the absorption of the earth's rays within 10 feet of the earth's snrface at
cent. This estimate I consider a moderate one, and the foregoing experiments
prove it to be 80.
Tt would be an error to suppose that determinations like these are easily made.
They require the most serupulous care for their snecessful accomplighment. The
hydrogen issned from the gas holder through an orifice of fixed dimensions in a
z3tream of the utmost possible constancy. It was then led into a Svac's regulator,
hence it is8ned under an absolutely constant pressure. The flame isswed from a
Froular brass burner with an aperture 4Fths of an inch in diameter. It was carefully
sFrrounded by a hoarding, the space within the hoarding being packed with horsehair.
ery precaution, in fact, was taken to avoid the agitation of the air around the flame.
per care was also taken to secure the pile against disturbance by air currents.
e air being first purified, by passing it through caustic potash and sulphurie acid,
vas rendered humid by carrying it over web bibulous paper contained in a suitable
tbe. Tt required some minutes to enter, and it was therefore necessary, by prior
patient observance of the needle, to make sure that during this interval no change
eSurred in the radiation save that effected by the humid air itself. The humid air
=Y removed from the experimental tube, nob by exhaustion which always canses
Tgecipitation, but by gently forcing, by means of a compressing pump, dry air through
tube. When this was done, the needle, in _ the experiments above recorded,
rgurned within a 8mall fraction of a degree to zero.*
SWith the rough, wide experimental tube to which reference has already been made,
ISten years ago, found the absorption of a column of humid air 38 inches long, to be
