Parallel evol- lakes [69]. These quasi-replicate founder populations sub-
ution occurs when the character states become neither more sequently diversify into communities of interacting (usually
nor less similar over time, whether or not they were initially competing) species. The fact that the communities are
identical [8]. Thus, the notion of repeatability is more closely initially identical (consisting of a single founder species)
related to the idea of parallel evolution when the initial states and the fact that they evolve on neighbouring but largely
are identical, but there are some distinctions. For example, isolated habitats with similar environments is important
parallel evolution implies a change in the character state.
