[25,51,52] seems to support this conjecture. Yet, correlations do Lifespan and fecundity evolve alongside with lowered extrinsic
not reveal causality, and in fact, a mathematical model has mortality and better nourishment of reproductives. In parallel,
shown that increased survivorship, i.e. low extrinsic mortality, the reproductive potential and lifespan of workers decrease
and/ora high fecundity, a priori select for the evolution of help- (figure 1). Such a perspective could combine model predictions
ing and sociality ([53], see also [54] and, for the evolution of like that division of labour facilitates unequal ageing [22] or
delayed dispersal, [55]).
