The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of the last expression is$!—= = /? ;
thus we are led to expect that f(z) is always an integral function of z, and that the
sum of its coefficients is f.

§ 3. The value of / was originally obtained by Frosentus* in the form

(where r defines the row and s the column in the determinant) as an immediate
deduction from the fact that f,, ,. a is the coefficient of x,%**-! x," *"~? ... %,74, In

To make the next paragraph more clear, we deduce the ordinary form of /.
