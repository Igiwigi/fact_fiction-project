His predictions haye been
fulfilled throughout. Tt was also through his courtesy that I was enabled to work with
the neat instrument made by Mr. Geis8LER, and T have had his valuable aid throughout
this investigation. |

It is evident that the experiments agree in detail with the fact that two internal
forces exist :—one, X,, independent of the velocity ; the other, —z, F(u), increasing as
the velocity increases and acting in a direction opposite to that of X;. The force acting
on the vessel is the reaction of the force which moyes the mill, and is therefore
expressed by

—X\+#,F(n).

. As long as z, f(t), which vanishes with u, increases, it has not yet arrived at the yalue
given by the equation
—X,+z,7(u)=0.
