ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY IN HIGH LATITUDES. 75

High values of the ionization accompany low values of the potential gradient and
vice versa.

Here we find that the ratio between positive and negative ionization (7) does
increase with the potential gradient over the range from 50 to 300 volts/metre. That
there is not the same agreement higher is to be expected from the fact that for
values of the potential gradient over 300 volts/metre the ionization is so small as to
be only just within the power of the instrument to measure, and so one cannot expect
the ratio of the observations to be given with any degree of accuracy; also the
number of observations with the potential gradient over 300 volts/metre is so small
that better results could hardly be expected.

We may, then, take it that the ionization and dissipation have a great determining
a influence on the potential gradient, and that high values of the potential gradient
5 are, on the whole, accompanied by high values of the ratio r and g.

Tonization and Dissipation.—It has already been stated that the values of the
dissipation, as given by Ester and Gerret’s instrument, depend mainly on the two
