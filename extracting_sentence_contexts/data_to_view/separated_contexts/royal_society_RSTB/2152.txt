I have in a previous paper offered evidence that tetanised nerve exhibits signs of
metabolism, and that such signs are throughout similar to the signs characteristic of
the action of carbon dioxide. Guided by the results obtained on nerve by pro-
longed tetanisation, I proceeded to test the effect of prolonged tetanisation upon the
retinal response to light, in the expectation that a retina provoked to activity in this
manner should exhibit signs of increased molecular mobility. And in point of fact such signs appear in the case of the retina in even more
striking degree than in that of nerve. Moreover they offer a distinct advantage in
