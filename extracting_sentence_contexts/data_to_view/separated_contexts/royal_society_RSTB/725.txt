and XX. in every respect.

< On looking over the records of these two double series of cultures, in bouillon-sugar
6 and bouillon-Pasteur, several points of interest are noticeable, in addition to the proof
= much of greater nutritive value of these media. -4 In the first place, it is evident once more that the organism is anaérobic in a high
"2 degree ; and I would call attention to the fact that the cushion—i.c., the gelatinous
2 coils—do not form until there is a large quantity of carbon dioxide in the liquids. 3 Even in the case of the tubes charged with hydrogen, and kept in an atmosphere of
'S that gas, the medium gradually became saturated with carbon dioxide in those cases
£ where a carbo-hydrate was present—a significant fact, I think, as indicating the source
2 of the carbon dioxide; and it is noticeable how much sooner the cushions were
developed in the tubes kept (in air) at 25° C. than in those at 15° C., a fact explicable
by the enhanced activity of the organism in its early stages.
