from those infirmities with which mine is afflicted.

In these experiments of Mr. SouTH's on Polaris, the braces
on the same side, whether the eastern or western, are of the
same temperature. The retardation, or acceleration, there-
fore of the star's passage, arises from the difference of the
changes produced by temperature in the upper and lower
parts of the tube of the telescope ; which difference, estimat-
ing it by its effect on the time of the star's passage, may be
very small, or not greater than the error of observation, or,
(for there is nothing improbable in the supposition) insensible.

But it may be said, is not this the bending of facts to suit an
hypothesis, instead of adopting the more natural supposition,
that the steadiness of the instrument arises from the excel-
lence of its construction. The construction, indeed, of Mr.
SouTn's instrument, in what regards the putting together of
the tubes composing the telescope and axis, essentially differs

inflexibility on Mr. SouTH's transit instrument ; for, were it
