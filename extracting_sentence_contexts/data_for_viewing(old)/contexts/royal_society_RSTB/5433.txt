the region of the excretory pore to the head end, whilst posteriorly the tail tapers from
a little in front of the anus to the tip.

The cuticle is finely striated transversely and the striations are interrupted by the
lateral fields, which are well defined and have a width in the middle of the body of
0-006mm. By careful focusing, under the oil-immersion, it can be seen that the lateral
field presents a double contour at each edge, due to its slightly winged character, whilst
towards the middle two longitudinal lateral lines can be distinguished.

The head is rounded and is set off from the body by a slight constriction. No papillie
or separate lips could be discovered on its surface. A mouth aperture is lacking and no
buccal rods or other specialised mouth structures are presentâ€”features doubtless con-
nected with the fact that the adult male does not feed. The outline of the fusiform
cesophagus present in the larval condition is now lost, but an cesophageal region is
present, extending from the head to a short distance behind the excretory pore, as a
faintly vacuolate and rather ill-defined area. The nerve-ring crosses the cesophagus
just in front of the excretory pore. There is no intestinal gland in the male.

At the tail end on each side of the body the cuticle is produced into a narrow wing-
like expansion or ala, which arises a little anterior to the anus from the ventral edge of
the lateral field and extends to the tip of the tail, as in many species of Tylenchus. Its
free edge is slightly crenate in appearance.

The spicules are paired and shaped as shown in fig. 15. Each is broad anteriorly and
tapers towards the tip. There is a short, simple gubernaculum. The gonad has been
