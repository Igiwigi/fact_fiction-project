It also follows that for this case of electro-chemical decomposition, and
it is probable for all cases, that the chemical power, like the magnetic force (366.),
is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity of electricity which passes.

378. Hence arises still further confirmation, if any were required, of the
identity of common and voltaic electricity, and that the differences of inten-
sity and quantity are quite sufficient to account for what were supposed to he
their distinctive qualities.

379. The extension which the present investigations have enabled me to
make of the facts and views constituting the theory of electro-chemical decom-
position, will, with some other points of electrical doctrine, be almost imme-
diately submitted to the Royal Society in another series of these Researches. Royal Institution,
