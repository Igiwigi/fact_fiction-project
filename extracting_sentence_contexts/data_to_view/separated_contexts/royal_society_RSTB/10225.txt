The negation particle ‘ne’ in
French, itself already a reduction from ‘non’, was felt as too
weak and was reinforced syntactically with the particle ‘pas’ (lit-
erally step) as in ‘je ne veux pas’ (I do not want). Today, ‘ne’ has
become optional and ‘pas’ has effectively become the negation
particle, as in ‘je veux pas’ (colloquial contemporary French). These uncontested facts suggest that we should not concep-
tualize the origins and evolution of language as an all-or-none
phenomenon, perhaps owing to a single genetic mutation that
gave rise to a single new operator (such as merge). Instead, it
makes more sense to inquire about the many cognitive mechan-
isms, the invention, learning and alignment strategies, and the
cultural evolutionary dynamics that have to be in place so that
a population of individuals can sustain these linguistic cycles
in the expression of meaning domains. The mechanisms include
analogical inference, routinization of behaviour, optimization,
analogical inference, hierarchical planning and plan recognition,
concept formation, imitation, associative memory and no doubt
many more.
