The results obtained in the washed sand, must, however,
be admitted to have much greater significance. As to the explanation of the results, WoLrr is disposed to attribute the gains of
nitrogen to the absorption of combined nitrogen from the air by the soils, and to the
fixation of free nitrogen within the soil under the influence of porous and alkaline
bodies, as supposed by Coiiz and Franx, rather than to the fixation of free nitrogen
either under the influence of micro-organisms, or directly by the plants themselves. In fact, neither were the conditions of his experiment with the clover in burnt soil,
nor those of his later experiments in washed sand, such as to favour the supposition
of the intervention of micro-organisms. On the other hand, he considers they were
favourable for the absorption of combined nitrogen from the air, and for the supposed
fixation of free nitrogen within the soil under the influence of porous and alkaline
bodies. At the same time, he admits that it is not easy to explain why Graminez do
not, equally with the Leguminose, benefit by such absorption, and by such fixation.
