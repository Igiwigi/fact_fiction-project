tube, be taken as indicative of the value for a flat tube, except that, both theoretically
and practically, the critical value of U,, is found to vary inversely as the hydraulic
mean depth, which would indicate that, as the hydraulic mean depth in a flat tube is
double that for a round tube, the criterion would be half the value, in which case the
limit found for K, would be about 0°61 K. This is sufficient is show that the

absolute theoretical limit found is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental

of the observed facts.

38. In order to arrive at the limit for the criterion it has been necessary to consider
the smallest values of w’, v’, w’, and the terms in the discriminating equation of the
fourth degree have been neglected. This, however, is only necessary for the limit,
and, preserving these higher terms, the discriminating equation affords an expression
dor the resistance in the case of steady mean-mean-motion.
