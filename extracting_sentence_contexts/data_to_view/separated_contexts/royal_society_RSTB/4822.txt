The chance of this occurrence in any assigned interval of time is similarly taken as
the same for all genera within the group considered and as constant for all time. These statements call for some comment. (a) The assumptions that the chances of specific (or generic) mutation are identical
for all forms within the group considered and constant for all time are unlikely to be
in accordance with the facts, but have to be made to simplify the work. (b) The chance. of a generic mutation or a specific mutation occurring is not taken as
dependent on the number of individuals in the genus or species.
