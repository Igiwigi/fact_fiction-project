The prominence of this chief deflection
and its uniform direction aroused our curiosity and suggested further experiment. We have, we think, clear evidence that it is this deflection which indicates the
arrival of the excitatory process at the point investigated. That the excitatory
process in the auricle is first signalled by relative negativity of the tissue in which it
first appears, is proved, if proof is still required, by the fact that leads from the
region which jirst shows electrical disturbance, i.e. the region of the S-A node,
invariably shows initial negativity. The excitatory process is accompanied by
a considerable discharge, as shown by the amplitude (1Â°5-6 millivolts) of the chief
excursion in the same leads.* A similar discharge is to be anticipated when the
excitatory process reaches outside leads.
