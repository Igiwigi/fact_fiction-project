required a volume of water of a sectional area not exceeding 7000 feet, or five times
as large. So with the Ouse, the measure, with the yalley flooded, may be 4000 feet
for the present river, and 20,000 feet for the old postpliocene river; for the Somme of
to-day 3000 feet, and for the old river 16,000 feet; and for the Seine 8000 feet now,
and 36,000 feet formerly. These are merely rough approximate estimates. They will
s8erve, however, to show that to fill the old channels, before the excavation of the exist-
ing valleys, to their entire breadth, would not have required more than, if 80 much as,
four or five times as much water as now flows during floods; but it must be remem-
bered that the normal condition of these quaternary rivers would be like that of rivers
of the present day that are subject to heavy periodical floods and have large and wide
channels, small portions only of which are filled by the river during a great part of the
year, â€”dry sand and shingle banks then occupying the larger portion of the area. A
swpply in fact very little if any larger than that drained off by the existing rivers might
have occupied the comparatively dry channels during the dry season, whilst these old
channels would be filled to overflowing during the melting of the snow in spring, inde-
pendently of any excess of rainfall, and be subject to periodical floods and inundations,
such as now are of annual occurrence in Arctic countries, when the waters rise 40 to
50 feet or more aboye their ordinary level*.

Although I can conceive that, granting an indefinite length of time, the wearing
power of torrential rivers might effect considerable erosions, we shall find that other
causes haye assisted to produce the immense valley-excavations we are now contem-
plating. For, if the period is assumed to have been one of severe winter cold, we must
follow out the consequences of that assumption, not only with regard to the floods
following upon the winter snows, but in all its collateral bearings.
