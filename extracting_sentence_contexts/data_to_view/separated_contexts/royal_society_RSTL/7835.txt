The general laws deduced from various cases are as follows :—if there
be, as there generally is, an excess of weight at both the extremities, the curve of loads
will cross the axis in an even number of points, and consequently the number of balanced
8ections is even. Hence it follows that the number of sections of maximum or minimum
shearing must also be even; and it is obvious that between two maximum ordinates of
the curve of shearing, both of which lie upon the same side of the axis, there must occur
either a minimum ordinate also lying upon the same side, or a maximum ordinate lying
upon the other side of the axis. Since these conditions hold, and we know in addition
that the curve of shearing must cross the axis in at least, one point, on account of the fact


WEIGHT AND SUPPORT IN SHIPS. 431

- that there is an excess of weight at both ends of the ship, it follows that if it crosses the
axis in any other points, these additional sections of zero shearing must be either two in
number or some multiple of two. In other words, the whole number of sections of zero

* shearing, which we have shown to be also sections of water-borne division, must be

- odd in 8hips having excesses of weight at the bow and stern.

© Before concluding these remarks on shearing-forces, it may be well to compare the

- condition of the © Minotaur,” © Bellerophon,” and *© Audacious* when fully laden and

* floating in still water, as they represent different classes of ironclads. At the foremost

- balanced section (R' in Plate XVII. fig. 8) of the * Minotaur” the shearing-force is no
less than 420 tons; at the corresponding station (R' in Plate XVII. fig. 9) in the

S Bellerophon' it is only 45 tons, and at that in the * Audacious' (R', in Plate XVII.

. 10) it is 120 tons.
