Whether they were there earlier, whether they ranged far over
the land surface of what is now Great Britain, and whether they were contempo-
raneous with the late Pliocene mammalian fauna, characterised by Mastodon
arvernensis, or with an earlier or a later mammalian fauna, are matters which remain
for further investigation. It seems that it would not be reasonable to put forward
any opinion on that point in our present state of knowledge. But one important
fact is clear and well established—the men who made these flint implements, and left
them on the Suffolk land surface, did so before the Red Crag was deposited. The time-relations of the Red Crag, and the subsequent glacial series of East
Anglia, to the river gravels of the south of England and the north of France, in
which flint implements—differing altogether from those of Pre-Crag age—are found,
are quite undetermined. But we may expect further information on this subject
at no distant date from the able geologists who are engaged in the study of it.
