16. These furrows usually form a kind of network with fusiform interstices
(Plate V. fig. 5), whilst in other cases they run parallel to each other and inosculate
more rarely (fig. 4). From the correspondence between their arrangement and that of
the passages in the interior, I am inclined to think that they belong to the same system
with these, being, in fact, canals not covered in by shell-zubstance, that communicate

stance, were specially pointed out by me in Nummulites (loc. oit.), rig changes

traced out in that genus.
