When not affected by the tide, the surface of the water slopes 80 that, com-.
pared with 'Trinity high water mark, it is below it by the following quantities:

But when it is high water, the whole surface becomes much more nearly leyel ;

'These high waters are not exactly contemporaneous; but this circumstance will
not affect the general facts. It appears therefore that the tide raises the sur-
face of the lower part of the river, s0 as to diminish the slope of that part ;
that this altered surface extends s8uccessively higher and higher up the river,
and is nearly horizontal at high water ; after that, the tide-surface again de-
scends, and the effects of it disappear in succession from the parts of the river,
beginning with the upper parts, till the low water surface is again attained. Velocity of the Tide-wave in Rivers.
