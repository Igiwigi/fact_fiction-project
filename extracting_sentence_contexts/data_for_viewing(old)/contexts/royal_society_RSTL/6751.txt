'= Owing to the negative character of the above results, it is not necessary to describe
Sthe apparatus, and the circumstances of the experiments, in any more detail, which would
ave been desirable had the results been of a positive kind.
2 We are, however, by no means prepared to infer, from the evidence just adduced, that
mder no cireumstances in nature is it possible for Ozone to transform nitrogenous com-
We of the ammonia class, or the nascent nitrogen evolved during decomposition,
Into oxides of Nitrogen. We would not say that it may not be possible for Ozone to
"Form such compounds when in connexion with non-nitrogenous bodies or porous sub-
"Stances permeated with gaseous Nitrogen, or even in the atmosphere. Nor are we pre-
Sared to maintain that the nitric acid in s0ils is not in part due to some of these causes.
EW questions will require much further investigation before they can be satisfactorily
oy To some of them we shall refer again presently.
But we wish particularly to call attention to the fact that, in the experiments just
erred to, there was a very much larger quantity of Ozone, acting upon organic matter,
Soil, &c., in a very wide range of circumstances, and for a much longer period of time,
an was involved in our experiments on the question of the assimilation of free Nitro-
by plants. Yet there was no appreciable quantity of nitric acid formed. It may
erefore be concluded that there will be no error introduced into the results of the
Experiments on the question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants themselves,
Swising from the action of Ozone upon free Nitrogen under the cireumstances of the
Experiments, and 80 providing to the plants an unaccounted supply of combined

Mitrogen.
