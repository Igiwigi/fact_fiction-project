from the first to the second of these two separation-years on the older plot 16, each
greatly diminished from its higher original amount on plots 19 and 20. Alopecurus
protensts again showed on both the new plots, and in both seasons, a great deficiency
compared with plot 16, although on both it showed an actual and considerable
increase. Toleus lanatus, on the other hand, was in much greater, and in more
rapidly increasing, amount on the two plots 19 and 20 than on 16 ; and it inereased
very much the more largely on the nitrate of potass plot 20, where in the second
separation-year it contributed more than a third of the total gramineous herbage.
Avena flavescens also, especially in the first year, yielded considerably less on plots
19 and 20 than on the older plot 16, though on both it rather increased in actual
amount. Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, and Avena pubescens, were also each
more or less in deficiency on plots 19 and 20. Cynosurus eristatus and Anthozanthum |
odoratum were, on the other hand, in some excess. It was, in fact, in the poorer
grasses—Mestuca ovina, Agrostis vulgaris, and Holeus lanatus—that the two newer
plots showed the greatest excess over plot 16 in the first, of the two Separation-years.
In the second separation-year, however, there was either a deficiency, or a less excess |
of these, as compared with their yield on plot 16; whilst those which were in the
greatest deficiency in the first separation-year on the newer plots compared with the |
older one, were the better grasses Alopecurus pratensts and Avena flavescens, each of |
