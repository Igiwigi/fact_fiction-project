In this one the distal terminations of the spicula of the skeleton are $111 someywhat
rounded, and slightly elevated above the common surface; while in (5), which has been
partially exhausted of the ova, the spicula have their distal terminations flat and some-
what angular, and they are level with the general surface, thus indicating a greater age
and a fuller development than obtain in the one represented by («), and not a less
amount of secretion of oya, as might possibly be imagined. These cireumstances are

strongly indicative of the fact that the oyaria, both in an active and an effete state, are
permanently seated in the sponge, and that the oya only are discharged from it. So in
like manner the existence of the ovarium in Spongilla reticulata and Brownii, confined
within a strong spicula case firmly incorporated with the skeleton, is strong presumptive
evidence of their also being permanent organs, and not of the nature of gemmules
which separate from the body of the sponge when they arrive at maturity and are ejected
through the great fecal orifice. Many other species of Geodia with which I am acquainted afford these ovaria in
great abundance, and with some variations in size and form from those in &.
