traced backwards in such sections it is found to taper off into a narrow string of cells.
This string in larve 16 days old extends to almost the mid-dorsal line of the
esophagus, and there ends in a thickening (fig. 30, Plate 11). This thickening
becomes gradually separated from the string of cells (figs. 31 and 32, Plate 11), and
forms a little solid nodule lying dorsal to the cesophagus beside the pore-canal. In
this stage it was seen by Bury (5). Later it acquires a cavity (fig. 33, Plate 11), and
persists throughout life as a perfectly closed thin-walled sac situated beneath the
madreporic plate. Bury (5) calls it the dorsal sac, and compares it to the peri-
cardium of the Tornaria larva and of Balanoglossus. In its origin, however, and its
adult relations, it exactly corresponds to the sac in Asterina gibbosa, which I termed
the right hydroccele (15),*

This sac was shown to be the homologue of the left hydroccele by the fact that in

* Tt is difficult to account for the pulsation which Bury (4) asserts that he has seen in this organ. In
his later paper (5), however, he admits that it is only the floor of the sac which pulsates. I have never
seen any pulsation in any part of the sac, nor is there any trace of muscle-fibres to be seen in its wall.
There is, however, a layer of muscle-fibres surrounding the csophagus, in which from time to time a
peristaltic contraction takes place. Now, the floor of the right hydroccele is closely opposed to the
esophagus at the sides, though it is raised up in the middle ; and it seems to me to be probable that it was
a passive movement of the hydroccele caused by peristalsis in the esophagus which misled Bury.

Bury’s theory has been revived by A. T. MasterMAN (“The Early Development of Cribrella
oculata,” ‘Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh,’ vol, 11). The development of this asterid is indeed extraordinary
if MASTERMAN’s results are confirmed. The ccoelom appears to arise as two separate vesicles from the
