yet still it might be adequate to ignite solid matters exposed
to them. TI had devised several experiments on this subject. I had intended to expose fine wires to oxygene and olefiant
gas, and to oxygene and hydrogene during their slow combi-
nation under different circumstances, when I was accidentally
led to the knowledge of the fact, and, at the same time, to
the discovery of a new and curious series of phenomena. I was making experiments on the increase of the limits of
the combustibility of gaseous mixtures of coal gas and air by
increase of temperature. For this purpose, I introduced a
small wire-gauze safe-lamp with some fine wire of platinum

fixed above the flame, into a combustible mixture containing
the maximum of coal gas, and when the inflammation had
taken place in the wire-gauze cylinder, I threw in more coal
gas, expecting that the heat acquired by the mixed gas in
passing through the wire-gauze would prevent the excess
from extinguishing the flame.
