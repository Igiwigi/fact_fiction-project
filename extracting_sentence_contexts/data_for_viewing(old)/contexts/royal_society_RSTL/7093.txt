respiration of the foetus prior to birth or exclusion.

5. The size, condition, and powers of the young at the time of birth or exclusion.

6. The period during which the young requires the lacteal nourishment.

7. The age at which the animal attains its full size.

In respect to the second point: as Mr. HaRRis caught the female Echidna with the
young, about an inch in length, on the 12th of August, she may be impregnated at the
latter end of June or in July. Females killed in the last week of July and the first
week of August, in the Province of Victoria, would be most likely to afford the capital
facts noted under the fourth head ; viz. the impregnated ovum #n utero showing some
stage of embryonal development in the spiny terrestrial Monotreme. As to the hairy
and aquatic Ornithorhynchus, the impregnated females in which ova were found in the
uterus, of 8mall size, and prior to the formation of the embryo, were caught on the 6th
and 7th of October*. Young Ornithorhynchi, measuring in length in a straight line
1 inch and Jths, were found in the nest on the 8th of December. The period of im-
pregnation is, therefore, in this species, in the locality of the Murrumbidgee River,
probably the latter end of September or beginning of October. Females captured in
the latter half of October and in the month of November, would be most likely to have
ova in utero exhibiting stages of embryonal development.

On this point I have been favoured with the following letter, one of a kind including
most which reach me from Australia on the subject, exciting, instead of allaying,
