it and the maximum length may be expressed as before by deter-

mining the angle which has its secant = ees
This is the angle which the distal articular surfaces
make with the horizontal plane when the bone is held
upright in the maximum position, or very nearly equal
to the inclination of the axis of the shaft to the vertical
when the trochlea and capitellum are placed on a
horizontal plane. The oblique length of the humerus does not represent
â€œso closely the effective length of the bone as does the

similar measure in the femur, but it would seem to be a

better measure of it than the maximum length. This

appears to be proved by the following rather remarkable
fact. On ascertaining the coefficients of correlation for the
lengths of pairs of bones, it was found that all the bones
except the radius were more closely correlated with the
tho. puvtioal.-Aubadeis.
