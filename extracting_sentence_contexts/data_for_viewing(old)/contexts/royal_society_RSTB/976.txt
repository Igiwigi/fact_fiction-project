If correction is made for the slightly different densities of the liquid nitrites, equal

yolumes of which have been administered, and equal weights are calculated, it does not
disturb the order, since it would favour the nitrites of high molecular weight which

Iready oceupy the leading position. The greater volatility and diffusibility of the

lower members evidently does not give them an advantage in connection with the
action on the pulse.

This order of physiological activity is not in harmony with the view that the action
gn the pulse is entirely, or even principally conditioned, by the presence of nitroxyl,
indeed, the facts as they stand point to exactly the opposite conclusion. A certain
*golume of ethyl nitrite, which is with one exception the weakest member of the series,
Represents twice as great a weight of nitroxyl as the same volume of the most active
@mpound, viz., tertiary amyl nitrite, and in general the physiological activity is
Thversely as the amount of nitroxyl the compound contains.
= When the differences in the chemical constitution of these nitrites are taken into
@ecount, we are led to the conclusion that either directly or indirectly the methyl, and
a the nitroxyl group is the determining cause of activity, since the successive sub-
@itution of methyl, which occurs as the series is ascended, is accompanied by an

in pulse-accelerating power, whilst this introduction of methyl involves a
portionate decrease in the amount of nitroxyl. The superior activity of secondary
â€˜Bnd tertiary compounds proves that the physiological effect of the substitution of
