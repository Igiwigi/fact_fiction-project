AUB=BUA (commutativity),
AU(BUC)=(AUB)UC (associativity) and
AUA=A _(idempotency).


Conjunction means that for any A,B € R, there exists A B € R satisfying the properties:
(ANB)NC=AN(BNC) (associativity) and
ANA=A _(idempotency).
But, generally, conjunction is not commutative and not distributive:
ANB#ZBNA (no commutativity) and
AN(BUC)4(ANB)UANC (no distributivity).

The fact that distributivity is absent in quantum logic was emphasized by Birkhoff & von
Neumann [15], who illustrated this by the following example. Suppose there are two events By
and Bz that, when combined, form unity, B, U Bz =1. Moreover, B, and B2 are such that each :
of them is orthogonal to a non-trivial event A 40, hence AN Bj =ANM By =0. According to this =
definition, AM (By U Bz) = AN 1=A. Butif the property of distributivity was true, then one would :
get (AM By) U(AN Bz) =0. This implies that A = 0, which contradicts the assumption that A #0. 12

It is easy to illustrate the concept of non-distributivity in quantum physics by numerous eal
examples. The simplest of these is as follows [16]. Let us measure the spin projection of a particle :
with spin 1/2. Let B; be the event of measuring the spin in the up state with respect to the x-axis, a]
whereas By is the event of measuring the spin in the down state along this axis. Because the spin ae
can be either up or down, B; U Bz = 1. Let A be the event of measuring the spin along an axis in if
the plane orthogonal to the z-axis. According to the rules of quantum mechanics, the spin cannot Ss
