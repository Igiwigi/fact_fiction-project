Thus the solution, both of the calcareous beds

A level valley-gravel period I could not say with certainty, We have evidence of these
5 beds occupying, on or near the coast-line, a level of from 50 to 100 feet above the sea
on both sides of the channel. This may arise from the sea encroaching on the land
and $0 intersecting, at varying distances from the old line of coast, the planes of the
old river-channels—which, like the present river-beds, necessarily slope from certain
heights inland to the sea-level,—or from an elevation of the land.
