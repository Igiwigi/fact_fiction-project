(&) +(5) +(&) +=". and these equations express all that we require to know about the ellipsoid, except the
fact that the surface is capable of being extended to infinity in every direction by the

variation of h, without ceasing to be closed. But it appeared also that the snccess of
the method depended only on the circumstance that the right-hand member of the first

equation, and the coefficient of F in the second, are constants independent of &. It was
therefore possible to generalize the process by taking indeterminate functions of 4; for
these two constants.
