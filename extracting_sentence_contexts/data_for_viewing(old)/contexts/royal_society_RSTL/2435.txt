613. Dr. Fusin1grr has also written on this subject, and given a theory which he
considers as sufflicient to account for the phenomena*, He expresses the immediate
cause thus : © The platina determines upon its surface a continual renovation of con-
crete lamina of the combustible substance of the gases or vapours, which flowing over
it, are burnt, pass away, and are renewed : this combustion at the snrface raises and
sustains the temperature of the metal.” The combustible s8ubstance, thus reduced into
imperceptible laminz, of which the concrete parts are in contact with the oxygen, is
presumed to be in a state combinable with the oxygen at a much lower temperature
than when it is in the gaseous state, and more in analogy with what is called the
nascent condition. That combustible gases should lose their elastic state, and become
concrete, assuming the form of exceedingly attenuated but solid strata, is considered
as proved by facts, some of which are quoted in the Giornale di Fisica for 18244; and
though the theory requires that they should assume this state at high temperatures,
and though the similay films of aqueous and other matter are dissipated by the action
of heat, still the facts are considered as justifying the conclusion against all oppo-
Sition of reasoning.

614. The power or force which makes combustible gas or vapour abandon its
elastic state in contact with a solid, that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum
of its own proper substance, is considered as being neither attraction nor affinity, It
