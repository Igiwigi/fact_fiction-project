Spontaneity ceases very rapidly even in weak solutions; and for an
exceedingly short time after it has done s0, the bell continues responsive both to tenta-
cular and to direct stimulation. For a long time after the bell ceases to respond to any
kind of stimulation, the nervous connexions between the tentacles and between the ten-
tacles and polypite remain intact, as also do the nervous connexions of these organs with
all parts of the bell. This interesting fact is rendered apparent, first, by stimulating
a tentacle and observing that all the four tentacles and the polypite respond ; and,
Second, by irritating any part of the neryo-muscular sheet of the bell and observing
that while the latter does not respond, both the tentacles and the polypite retract. Recovery from this stage occupies several hours. In the case of Tiarops's the conyulsions are, as usual, more pronounced, being
marked by the occurrence of a gradually increasing spasm, which differs from a normal
spasm in the respects already described under strychnia.
