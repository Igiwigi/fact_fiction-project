Adding to the mystique is the fact that gravity is the force that is most familiar to us as people
living on the Earth. It is not surprising that reports in the media of significant discrepancies
between experimental determinations of the value of Newton’s constant of gravity can catch the
public imagination, as the publication of our result did in October 2013 [4].

What matters then is not the actual value of G itself (give or take a percentage or so) but
its uncertainty. The real importance of the accuracy of G is arguably that it can be taken as a
measure, in popular culture, of how well we understand our most familiar force: the discrepant
results may signify some new physics, or they may demonstrate that we do not understand the
metrology of measuring weak forces. Owing to the lack of theoretical understanding of gravity,
as alluded to earlier, there is an abundance of respectable theories that predict violations of
the inverse square law or violations of the universality of free fall. In fact, a growing view is
that G is not truly universal and may depend on matter density on astrophysical scales, for
example. A misunderstanding of the metrology of weak force physics may in turn imply that
the experimental tests that have established the inverse square law and the universality of free
fall thus far are flawed in some subtle fashion. This makes for a potentially exciting situation and
perhaps explains the general interest shown in our apparently mundane and painstaking work
onG.

At the time of Newton and indeed up until the nineteenth century, the concept of a
fundamental constant did not exist. Newton did not express his law of gravitation in a way that
explicitly included a constant G, its presence was implied as if it had a value equal to 1. It was
not until 1873 that Cornu and Bailey explicitly introduced a symbol for the coupling constant in
Newton’s law of gravity, in fact they called it f. It did not take its current designation G until
