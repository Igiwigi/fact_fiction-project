Erie DE BEAUMONT, in his celebrated Es8ay on Mount Etna before cited, has repre-
$ented the escarpments of the Val del Bove as being composed of many hundreds of
perfectly regular beds, formed alternately of rocks of fusion and of fragmentary and
pulverulent materials. He describes the thickness of the beds as varying from a few
inches to several yards, but averaging about 6 feet each, the fragmentary beds being gene-
Tally, though not always, thicker than the lavas. At the same time, he insists on the
3 Ttemarkable uniformity in thickness and parallelism of the several members of this whole
Q zeries, and their continuity for great distances, a fact adduced as confirmatory of the
Y doctrine that the beds were originally horizontal, and were afterwards brought by
E upheaval into their present position. 'The same author states, that * the most general
S and the most conclusive character of the numerous beds of fused and fragmentary mat-
& ter consists in this, that they are liable, all of them, to be bent together as they pass in
SD several different directions, from a nearly horizontal position to an inclination of from
S 25% to 30®, without either their structure or their thickness being altered with any
= degree of regularity*.” The volcanic strata are therefore likened by him to the regular
= sedimentary formations which have undergone great flexures in mountain chains.
