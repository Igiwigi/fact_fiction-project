The preliminary results for short feeding periods are given in Table X in which the
number of infections obtained from feeding on the first plant of each pair are given
in the columns headed A. The columns headed B give the total number of infections

in the second series of plants, and the C columns show the number of consecutive
infections in which both A and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur
when A is not infected may have been due to failure on the part of the observer
to ensure proper feeding on A, but later experiments indicate that this is unlikely,
so that a large proportion of these also represent consecutive infections (p. 483).

Feeding time on the B plant was 2 hours throughout

This preliminary experiment gave a somewhat unexpected result, in that the
percentage infection decreased with increasing time on the infected plant, and a very
much higher number of infections was obtained for 3 and 5 minutes’ feeding than for
12 hours. There is agreement with previous results in the increase in percentage
infection with increasing time on the healthy plants.
