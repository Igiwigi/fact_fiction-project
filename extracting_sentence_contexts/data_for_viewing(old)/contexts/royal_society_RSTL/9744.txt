"Estrip of tipfoil the locus of their consecutive intersections would give the evolute* of
Sthe curve formed by the strip of tinfoil, and that as such locus it would probably be
"Srepresented by an especially bright line. We tried the experiment with a fine copper
Swire in the form of an ellipse, which was bent round 80 as to lie on the tube, and it was
-=ſfound to answer perfectly. The four-cusped shape of the evolute was distinctly marked
Aby a bright line of phosphorescence (Plate 28, fig. 17).
Tt is easy to advance from the case of a strip of tinfoil to that of a patch whose
© length and breadth are alike considerable. The molecular streams from beneath the
— elements in the interior of the tinfoil will be hindered from spreading out in any
© direction by the action of the cireumjacent elements, and they will therefore be con-
» centrated and forced to pas off in a normal direction. The elements at the edge of
» the tinfoil are, however, in a different position, they can still spread out in directions
» normal to the edge of the patch. They are in fact much in the same condition, 80 far
