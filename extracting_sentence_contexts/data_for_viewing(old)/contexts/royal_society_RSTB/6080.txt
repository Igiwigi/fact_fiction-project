In this lecture I have attempted to extend and to review our knowledge of the
developmental processes in the Primates so far as these relate to the earlier stages
of development and the formation of the placenta and now, in conclusion, I propose
to indicate quite briefly what seem to me the chief conclusions and inferences as to
the evolutionary history of the Order that may legitimately be drawn from the embryo-
logical data now available.

As the outcome of a survey of the development in representatives of the several
subdivisions of the Order, I have distinguished four well-defined developmental stages
or grades within it, which I have designated the Lemuroid, the Tarsioid, the Pithecoid
and the Anthropoid stages. These coincide only in part with the subdivisions recognised
by the systematist. The facts and considerations I have adduced in the body of this
lecture demonstrate, in my opinion, conclusively, that these four grades represent
successive stages in the developmental evolution of the Primates, 7.e., in the evolution
of those developmental features, generally recognised as distinctive of the group and
that being so, I venture to suggest that they may represent also actual phyletic stages
in the evolution of the Order.

The basal or Lemuroid stage (typified by the existing Lemuroidea) is characterised
developmentally by a combination of generalised or primitive features such as are
met with in the development of lower (non-primate) Mammals (including what I hold
to be a primitive type of diffuse, non-deciduate placenta), together with certain other
features which I regard as progressive and anticipatory of conditions which become
fully manifest in the next higher or Tarsioid grade. The developmental plan, presented
