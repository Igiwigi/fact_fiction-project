Coecke and other category theorists establish this type of ‘functor’ by recasting the Hilbert-space 1g
formalism of QFDT so as to connect the two categories in question—that of circuits and that : &

of mathematical structures, enabling proper predictions—rather than derive this functor from
axioms or postulates, as Hardy or D’Ariano and co-workers aim to do.

Circuits, then, and their arrangements symbolically embody or represent the architecture of
measuring instruments capable of detecting and measuring quantum events, and also enabling
the probabilistic predictions of future events. Their arrangement and operations in the second
respect is enabled by rules that should ideally be derived from certain sufficiently natural
assumptions, independent, for example, of the correspondence principle, which make quantum
theory depend on classical physics. On the other hand, circuits and their arrangements are
still described classically, a fact related to Bohr’s correspondence principle, a connection that,
however, requires a separate analysis.

An important difficult question is the relationships between the architecture of the ‘circuits’,
that is, experimental arrangements used in the experiments, in the standard (infinite-dimensional)
QM, and the architecture of the theory, or the same relationships in QFT. Consider the double-
slit experiment, say, in the interference pattern set-up (both slits are open and no counters
installed allowing one to determine through which slit each particle passes). It is a circuit, which
embodies (or could be represented by a scheme that embodies) preparations, measurements
and predictions, the latter manifested in the interference pattern. However, then mathematical
architecture enabling these predictions is a combination of the formal architecture of the equations
of QM, equations taken from classical physics by the mathematical correspondence principle, and
new types of variables, ‘guessed’ by Heisenberg, rather than derived from the architecture of
