The angle thus formed with the temporal perpendicular is constantly larger in my
Japanese (average 40°) than in my Chinese brains (average 35°). The same is seen in the
three Japanese brains described by Serat (1913). This is in harmony with the greater height of the Chinese head and with the fact,
observed by BAtz (1880), that the Japanese front tends to protrude, a feature rarely
oceurring with the Chinese, cf. HABERER (1902) and Mocut (1908). On the mesial side
the high callosum index and small stem angle (average 96°) are equally striking, as in
the Chinese. I finish this part of my paper by showing some brains of Bataks, a people usually
considered as belonging to the Protomalay or Indonesians of Hamy (1926), together
with the people of Mentawei and Nias and the Dajaks (KLEetwe@ DE ZWAAN (1925) ).
