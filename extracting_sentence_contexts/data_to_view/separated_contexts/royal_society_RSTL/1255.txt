In some of the specimens in Mr. GrtirFiTas's possession,
the shell is just covered in, and that part close to the termi-
nation is extremely thin, but in others is increased in thickness
twenty fold: in others again the shell has not only become
thick, but the animal has receded from its first inclosure, and
has formed a second three inches up the tube, and afterwards
a third two inches further on, and has made the sides thicker
and thicker, to diminish the canal in proportion to. the dimi-

at its full growth, or whenever prevented from increasing its
length, closes up the end of its shell, and lives a long time
afterwards, furnished with food from the sea-water it receives

than many of the other vermes, and have a portion of red
