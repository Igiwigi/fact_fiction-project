kernels fit to the x-, y- and z- directions of the spatial autocor-
relation of the image noise (the residuals after removing the
mean signal from each voxel) in each dataset was used to esti-
mate the image blurring after the acquisition and after pre-
processing (see electronic supplementary material for
details). Previous work [118] has characterized the image
blurring in two-dimensional SE EPI and three-dimensional
GRASE (each acquisition has a worst direction), and the
data shown in figure 5 recapitulate that. On top of that, the
blurring in the phase-encode direction for the particular
two-dimensional GE EPI data shown in figure 5 was exacer-
bated by the use of PF acquisition. PF acquisition
undersamples the data, taking advantage of the fact that
one half of k-space can be inferred from the other half,
because a real-world image is represented in frequency
space by a complex-valued matrix with Hermitian symmetry.
PF acquisition can, however, degrade image resolution
because it introduces an asymmetry in k-space that equates
to a convolution kernel in image space. To mitigate this pro-
blem, some systems estimate the missing data (using a
variety of algorithms) when reconstructing PF images, but
the downside to this approach is the possibility of creating
image artefacts. The scanner used for this acquisition
defaulted to doing nothing, leaving zeros in the matrix
before doing the inverse Fourier transform to create the
