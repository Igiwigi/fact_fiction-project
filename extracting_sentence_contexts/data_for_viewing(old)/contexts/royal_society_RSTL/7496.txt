simultaneously with the 8mall amount manifested in the permanent magnet, is the
constant accompaniment of, at least, a correlative amount of electricity evolved from the
magneto-electric machine, either all at once, in a large quantity, or by a continuous
succession of small quantities (45, 46), —the power which the metals (but more particu-
larly iron) possess of accumulating and retaining a temporary charge of electricity, or of
magnetism, or of both together (according to the mode in which these forces are viewed
by physicists), giving rise to the paradoxical phenomena which form the subject of this
research *.

Q 55. The fact that a large amount of magnetisxm can be developed in an electro-magnet

by means of a permanent magnet of much smaller power having been established, and as
Zfrom the first series of experiments (Table I.) it was shown that definite quantities of
=magnetism are accompanied by the evolution of proportionate quantities of dynamic
Selectricity, and smnce an electro-magnet, when excited by means of a voltaic battery,
=Spossesscs all the properties of a permanent magnet, it appeared reasonable to suppose
Sthat a large electro-magnet excited by means of a «mall magneto-eclectric machine could,
i= :Sby switable arrangements, be made instrumental in evolving a proportionately large
i = quantity of dynamic electricity, notwithstanding the pulsatory character of the electricity
