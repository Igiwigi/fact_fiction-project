In its original formulation, such a theorem requires the boundedness of the
bulk actions, the knowledge of the integral balance of forces, and the actionâ€”reaction
principle. If we choose to act in this way, we have to remind that we are not sure about
the effectiveness of the result: analogy, in fact, is not always a secure path. The direct assignment of integral balances demands fewer assumptions, in fact, and
allows to try to prove Cauchy-type theorems. However, since we consider M as a
nonlinear manifold, which is the general unifying choice, prescribing an independent
integral balance of micro-actions would be highly questionable formally. We would write,
in fact, integrals involving integrands taking values on the cotangent bundle of M, which
is anonlinear space (unless M coincides with a linear space) and is the target space of the
integrand, so the definition of the integral itself would be questionable.
