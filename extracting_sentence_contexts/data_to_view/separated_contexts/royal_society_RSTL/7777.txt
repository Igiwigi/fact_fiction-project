The only true coniferous wood
which I have seen in the Coal-measures of this country is the Sternbergian Dadoxylon,
which I described some years ago in the Transactions of the Philosophical Society of
Manchester; and eyen in that example, as I have recently shown*, some of the
characteristics of the highest Conifers are wanting. But in New Brunswick Dr. Daws0N
has found true coniferous woods in the greatest abundance, not only in the Carbon-
iferous but in the Deyonian bedsâ€”a fact which shows that even in studying the flora
of that early age, when individual types were much more cosmopolitan than now, we
require great caution in accepting those of one continent as evidences of what exist in
another. Tn the yolume recently published by the Palzontographical Societyf Mr. Bixxay has
pointed out many of the more conspicuous features characterizing the Calamites of Lan-
caghire, With some of his descriptions I cordially agree, but from others I have been

obliged to differ, as will appear in the following pages.
