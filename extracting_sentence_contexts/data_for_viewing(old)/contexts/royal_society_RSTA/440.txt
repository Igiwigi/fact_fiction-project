as a contributor to the 2002 CODATA-recommended value for G, and essentially adopted
the Gundlach—Merkowitz value as their new recommended value for the Newtonian constant
of gravitation.

Accordingly, as we then felt that we had gotten the ‘wrong number’, we spent some 5 years
looking under every experimental rock and stone, checking and rechecking all of our calculations,
and at the same time we rethought our various assumptions, remeasured and measured anew
various things, and consulted with ‘experts’—only to uncover nothing that would change our
result by more than 1 or 2 parts in 10°! What to do? We simply (and finally) published our new
result which disagreed with CODATA’s recommended value by some parts in 104 but which
agreed with the Luther-Towler value at the one-sigma level. (I have to confess that early on I
had not thought carefully through the implications of not correcting the Luther-Towler result
(had the fibre Qs all been measured) for anelasticity; in fact, given the fibres used, a correction
would have only slightly lowered the Luther-Towler published value.) I think that CODATA may
have also rethought the implications of this as they again included the Luther-Towler number
in their subsequent 2006 and 2010 recommendations. Figure 8 shows the history of CODATA’s
recommended values for G going back to 1973 where, as plotted, the position of the recommended
G value moves to the right or to the left proportional to the recommended increase or decrease for
this number. Note that the accuracy associated with the CODATA-recommended value for this
constant has not improved in the past 25 years!
