retreating, but always retreating farther than it advanced until it got back again to

* Neutral, that is to say neither green nor violet. The nentral region between red and blue during
green-blindness has quite a different hue. It should be noted that the word is not used to indicate the

blindness the green of the spectrum passes into violet through a colour in which there is uot the
slightest suggestion of blue. MR. G.
