If the plant really attained a relatively large size, then we must assume that
| our material is made up of young specimens. This brings us to the most important of all questions, that as to the fructification. It is a remarkable fact, that though Lyginodendron Oldhamium is one of the
commonest of our English coal-fossils, and though all its vegetative organs are pre-
served with astonishing perfection, no certain traces of reproductive organs have
ever been discovered. If the plants constituting owr material had borne anything at all of the nature of
4 cone, it is difficult to understand why its remains should never have been found. The only cone-like body discovered had, as we have shown above, nothing to do with
the fructification.
