which expresses that the ets (, 3, y, 3) and («', 8, y, 2') are homographic; for although
the homographic equation may be considered as belonging to the theory of the bipartite
quadric (x—&y) (x—=e'y), yet the theory of involution cannot be completely discussed
except in connexion with that of homography. If we write
A=(Þ—y)(«—d), B=(y—«)(BÞ—3), C=(a=BNy —d),
A'=(B—y)(s—d), B=(/—)(8'—?), C=(s—BN7—3),
then we have
A+B+C=0,
A'+B'+C'=0,
and thence
BC'—B'C=CA'—C'A=AB'—A'B;
and either of these expressions is in fact equal to the last-mentioned determinant, as
may be easily verified.
