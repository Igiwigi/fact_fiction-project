the suspended column of water being manifested at the base. The explanation is,
however, a simple one, the tube probably contained at no time a continuous free
suspended column of water, but series of columns broken by supporting menisci, and
the absorption at the base, with its resultant negative pressure, was due to the continued
absorption of water by the plaster of paris, a power which it retains after setting.
CopELAND’s tube is merely a modification of that described by Jamiy,t and in
a similar tube set up by SrraspurGER{ the water rose with progressively increasing
slowness, requiring 100 days to attain a height of 301 centims. The resistance to flow
through a tube filled with plaster of paris is enormously greater than through the
vessels of a stem, and the osmotic cell used by CopELanp was incapable of developing
a sufficient osmotic force to draw water at an appreciable rate through his tube, even
if this enormous tension could have been transmitted through the water (and
air-bubbles) in the plaster of paris. In fact, if CopELanpd had removed the osmotic
cell and the upper 9 metres of his apparatus, he would have obtained precisely the
same results as when they were present. D1rxon has shown§ that CorpELANp’s tube,
under a head of 122 centims. Hg, would not transmit 1 cub. centim. per annum,

As was perhaps first.clearly shown by ScHwENDENER,|| the vessels of actively
transpiring wood do not contain continuous water columns, but always contain
varying numbers of air-bubbles. ‘This statement has been’ confirmed by all
subsequent observers, and no theory of the ascent of sap is worthy of a moment's
consideration which does not take this fact into account. According to SrRASBURGER,
the channels containing least air are most active in the ascent of sap, but this is the
direct physical consequence of the lesser resistance to flow in the vessels more
completely filled with water. The fact that the water disappears first from the
