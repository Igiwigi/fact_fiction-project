alization in determining the efficiency of online motor
control.

In our experimental design, actions redirected towards the
midline start in the periphery to end up closer to the body mid-
line, while the opposite is true for actions redirected away from
the midline. On the other end, the efficiency of online correc-
tions depends on how early corrections start to be operated
along the reaching path. Therefore, the privileged processing
of visual information presented in the region of the body mid-
line [22,23] should in principle facilitate early corrections—thus
increasing the redirection efficiency—in our reaching actions
redirected away from the midline. In these cases, in fact, the
initial part of the virtual hand trajectory—the one providing

(c) Proprioceptive recalibration

A blind reach task, in which participants had to reach a visu-
alized target without visual feedback from the moving hand
[57], was adopted as an implicit measure of embodiment of
the virtual hands [58], with the aim of controlling for the
possible impact of different degrees of embodiment on the
efficiency of online corrections. Results are fully presented
in the electronic supplementary material as they support a
control. In summary, a progressive increase of the propriocep-
