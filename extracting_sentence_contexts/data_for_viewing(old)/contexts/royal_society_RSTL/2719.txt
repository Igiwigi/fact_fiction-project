In these organs the living blood and neryous influence cooperate in the functions
of secretion and assimilation ; and it is an acknowledged fact, that when a determi-
nation of blood to secreting organs takes place, there is in the same proportion
an increase of their secreted fluids, a result which cannot arrive without a corre-
sponding supply of nervous influence. Thus we know, as indeed we had reason
to expect, that the presence of the living blood in the secreting organs solicits a pro-
portionable supply of that influence ; and thus it was, that whereas, while I operated
on the nerves of voluntary motion, my attempts were wholly fruitless, the very first
attempt with the ganglionic nerves was crowned with snccess ; nor, since the repe-
tition of the experiments in London and Paris, has the fact been questioned.

If the facts I have stated be correct, we can have little doubt that the nervous in-
fluence is of a nature similar to the inanimate agent which was substituted for it ; for
to say nothing of the cireumstance of the neryous influence being capable of existing
in a texture different from that to which it belongs in the living animal, we cannot
suppose that there are two distinct powers, the one of which is capable of all the
effects of the other ; or I would rather say, that such a supposition amounts to a con-
tradiction in terms, because as it is acknowledged that we know nothing of any
principle of action but by its properties, it necessarily follows, that by these alone it
can be distinguished.

In discussing the nature of the nervous influence too much has been ascribed to elec-
tric tests, which are referred to as if they possessed a power equal to that of chemical
