Ape, the Cat, and the Ocelot than in the corresponding series in the Sheep and Pig.
This increase in size is chiefly assumed in their short diameter or width, the cell
being swollen, ovoid, and often approaching a globular contour. The protoplasmic
mass forming these cells is therefore much greater in these higher ' animals. The
important consideration attached to this form is dependent upon the fact that the
8wollen form is invariably associated with a far more complex branching from all parts
of the periphery of the cell, whilst in the pyramidal cell the lateral angles give rise to
the greater number of processes. In fact, the oval swollen cell shows numerous
angular projections spread over its surface, from which delicate processes arise, and it
is presumably the situation and number of these branches which form the chief
elements in moulding the contour of the cell. Thus, the simplest cell is elongated,
spindle-shaped, and bi-polar ; the acquirement of a third process thrown off the centre
of the body of the cell gives the spindle an angularity frequently observed in the last
layer of the cortex. This appears to be the origin of the pyramidal form of cell and
its various modifications and multipolar varieties. Two elementary forms of cell con-
stantly occur in the cortex cerebri, which develop the one into the small pyramidal
and angular, and the other into the large pyramidal and ganglionic series. Tt appears
that when the processes arising from. the larger cells are most numerous, we get the
plump ganglionic cellâ€”when less numerous, the large pyramidal cells of the third
layer ; whilst, if. the complexity in branching of the smaller cell is great, we have an
