Apart from the variation of amplitude in BOLD signal,
additional temporal characteristics of the haemodynamic response, not available from tSNR and
FC maps such as time to peak, could be revealed by statistical analysis of spontaneous point
process HRF. Unlike thermal noise, physiological fluctuations can introduce fluctuations in the fMRI signal
that are uncoupled from neural activity, and are among the most important confounds in BOLD
signal change [17]. In fact, cardiac mechanisms include changes in cerebral blood flow/volume
and arterial pulsatility [18]. Respiration effects include changes in Bo and arterial CO2 partial
pressure [19]. Although cardiac and respiratory cycles have relatively high frequencies in contrast
to the typical low-frequency (less than 0.1Hz) BOLD fluctuations, aliasing of physiological
components to lower frequency range will inevitably occur owing to lower sampling rate in
BOLD fMRI than cardiac and respiratory cycles [20].
