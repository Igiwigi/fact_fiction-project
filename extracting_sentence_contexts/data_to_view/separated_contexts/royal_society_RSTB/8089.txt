It is also
possible for individuals to learn from the behaviour
of others directly—learning in the form of ‘do what
I do’. Humans use the behaviour of those around
them as cues as to what are ‘fit’ strategies, using both
the frequency of the behaviour [79] and the success
of the model (e.g. wealth, high status and health) as
guides [80]. We have some evidence that individuals do, in fact,
imitate the hygiene behaviour of the group (though
there are other effects here beyond blind copying). A study monitoring handwashing with soap in a
motorway service station showed that it was more fre-
quent if there were several people present in the toilet
[81]. Similar effects have been found elsewhere [82].
