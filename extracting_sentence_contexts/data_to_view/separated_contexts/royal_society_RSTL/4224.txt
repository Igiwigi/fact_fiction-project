It is certainly not a little singular that the ether compounds of this whole series of
acids, the lecanoric, the erythric, the alpha and beta orsellic acids, and here again the
gyrophoric acid, should approach each other 80 closely in their general properties
andin' their per cent. composition. Mr. Scuuxcr has been induced by this cireum-
Stance to think it probable that all this class of acids are coupled acids containing
lecanoric acid and an adjunct, and that the ethers which they yield are in fact only
one compound, viz. lecanoric ether. Mr, Scuuncx's hypothesis is, however, much
weakened from the fact that we possess no means of reproducing lecanoric acid
from the s0-called lecanoric ether, for when any of these ethers are acted on by an
alkali, the organic acid they contain undergoes decomposition as well as the com-
pound itself.
