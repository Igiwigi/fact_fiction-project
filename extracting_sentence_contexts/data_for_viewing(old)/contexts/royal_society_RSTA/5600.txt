compared with that of the cubic one, which is stabilized by Al incorporation [48,49,53]. (b) Crystal structure of cubic Li;La3ZtTa0
which shows a similar ionic conductivity as the Al-stabilized form. The sites 24d and 96h form a three-dimensional network
that enables the ions to move fast through the rigid crystal structure. (c) Comparison of the 7Li NMR motional curve (MN) of
tetra-LLZO with those of various cubic variants. The earlier line narrowing sets in (on the temperature scale), the faster the ion
hopping processes that average dipole-dipole (Li-Li) couplings. For comparison, the MN curve of a thiophosphate LiPS<Br is
also included [54]. (Online version in colour.)

the local jump processes are to be characterized by a barrier as low as 0.12 eV [48,49]. This value,
which is associated with the asymmetry of the whole rate peak, points to highly correlated ion
dynamics in Al-LLZO. Long-range ion transport in the two compounds, as is seen by spin-lock
NMR, is governed by activation energies of 0.52 eV and 0.35 eV [48,49,53]. The fact that the rate
peaks appear at almost the same Tmax shows that the pre-factor of the corresponding Arrhenius
relation of Al-LLZO is much lower than that in the structurally ordered form of Li7La3Zr2O 2
[54].

In figure 5, we also compare the so-called 7Li NMR motional narrowing curve of tetragonal
LLZO with those of some of its cubic variants for which Zr is replaced by Ta or Mo [54]. Ga-
stabilized LLZO crystallizes in an acentric cubic modification of LLZO and shows even higher
