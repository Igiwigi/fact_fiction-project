The latter will obviously appear on the
way since they are driving the mathematical questions.

2. Kinetic models with non-physical interactions

Recently, ideas from statistical physics have started to permeate the socio-economic sciences,
leading to mean-field and kinetic PDEs as the main tools for qualitative and quantitative research. Their applicability relies on the fact that socio-economic processes are often governed—similar
to statistical physics—by the interaction of large ‘particle’ systems, where the particles are
human beings (inter)acting in socio-economic scenarios. The natural step is to go from those
particle models to kinetic and further macroscopic PDE models. In those, several novel issues
appear due to the obvious differences compared to classical models in physics.
