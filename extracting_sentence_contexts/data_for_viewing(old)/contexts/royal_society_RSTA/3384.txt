The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of the Universe is increasing [15]. 5&8
In apparent contrast to the second law, matter and radiation appear have started out in .
thermodynamic equilibrium—a high entropy state [16,17]. In addition, the gravitational field at
the birth of the Universe was highly structured (low entropy yet also smooth and featureless) but
is becoming less ordered [18]. These two facts coupled to confusing use of the terms, ‘entropy’,
‘structure’, ‘order’, ‘uniformity’, etc. have led to a variety of at odds or unclear positions on what
it means to say that entropy is increasing. As I am by no means an expert on this topic, I, with
gratitude to Sean Carroll, refer the reader to Wallace [17], who nicely summarizes the conventional
thinking and space of positions. He offers a restatement in which he emphasizes that the early
Universe was not at global thermal equilibrium, only local thermal equilibrium, and gives the
reasons why.

For our purposes here, the important point is that entropy is increasing and, as it does, at least
some of the detailed information we initially had about the system is lost, making prediction
about the behaviour of the system difficult. My interest in this is twofold. First, a point which
i will get to in a moment, is how we can improve our capacity to make predictions under this
condition. Second, a point which I get to in §3 is how we can reduce entropy locally to increase
