This formula is further interesting, because of the close relation it would establish
between oil of turpentine and its resin, and that of gamboge ; since

The fact, however, that in all the analyses there is a constant deficiency of carbon
to the amount of nearly one per cent., renders the formula snspicious. It is true that
the gambodic acid has a strong affinity or attraction for ether and alcohol, and that
a certain quantity of these substances may have been present in some of the speci-
mens analysed ; yet, it would be necessary to suppose a much larger admixture of
them than seems possible, in order to account for s0 great a diminution in the per
centage of carbon. Neither can we admit the presence of these substances in the
resin after solution in potash, though the carbon in this also is considerably less than
the formula requires.
