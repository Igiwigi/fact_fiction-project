dimensions present a great polydispersion. In the composite particles (SM, figure 2b), spheroidal
granules of magnetite nanoparticles appear attached to the surface of the SP particles. In fact, the
EDX (electron dispersive X-ray) microanalysis carried out in the same SEM microscope clearly
demonstrated the presence of significant amounts of iron atoms: the peaks of Fe had practically
the same intensity as the Si ones. The pictures of the SMA particles (figure 2c) show that the
alginate layer favours a more smooth surface texture than that in the SM particles.

More interestingly, for the goal of the present work, figure 2d shows the microstructure of
the magnetic hydrogel (Ferrogel-1). In this picture, the more brilliant regions (coloured in false
light blue) correspond to the heavier atoms (silicon and mainly iron), while the less brilliant
(brown colour) corresponds to the lighter atoms. Thus, we can clearly distinguish the magnetic
composites (SMA) from the polymer fibres. The particles seem not only randomly embedded
in the polymer network, but also linked by multiple bonds to the alginate chains. This fact
demonstrates the relevant role played by the alginate molecules adsorbed on the particles: both
the alginate molecules in the pre-gel solution and those previously adsorbed on the particles
should be cross-linked to each other by calcium ions. Therefore, the SMA particles are embedded
as knots in a highly entangled network, which will have important effects on the MR response of
the ferrogels, as we will see in ยง3c.

As mentioned in the ยง1, one of the advantages of using the SM composite particles is their low
average density, as compared with that of pure magnetite, which would hinder their gravitational
