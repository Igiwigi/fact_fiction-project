The critical wavelength is always of the same order as the body
thickness, and is more influenced by the parameter qj, if w,, > 1, as we can note from figure 3b,d. The case in which ap = 1 is of particular interest in the applications because it is reproducible
in experiments using hydrogels. In fact, these soft materials are mainly composed of water, thus
