The dogfish is very voracious, and a great enemy to
the figherman and his tackle, and therefore never spared when
caught : besides, it is well known that dogfish chiefly pur-

sue the shoals of herrings, which have left these coasts be-

has met with beds of copperas at the bottom of the sea, and
thereby is poisoned ; but why should such beds (supposing the
case true) have worse effects in 1789, than at any time be-
fore? It is an indisputable fact, that many ships, on the return from
Archangel, in the latter end of 178g, saw immense quantities of
haddocks (no other fish were particularized), for fifty or sixty
leagues, I believe, lying dead on the surface of the sea, but
could not at that time ascribe any cause for the event, I
believe about that time an eruption broke out in Hecla, and
perhaps it may with some degree of probability be con-
Jjectured, that volcanic matter, of noxious quality, may have
burst in the sea, and occasjoned the above destruction and
failure ever since. The few haddocks caught in 1789 and 1790, were remark-
ably large; these keep nearest the shore : the small ones lie
more out to sea ; 80 that, when fishermen were wont to catgh
small haddocks, they desisted, and came nearer the shore to
procure the large ones. The $hoal generally lay about one
league from the shore, was about three miles in breadth, and
in length extended near the whole coasts of the three coun-
ties, in constant succession, for about three months.
