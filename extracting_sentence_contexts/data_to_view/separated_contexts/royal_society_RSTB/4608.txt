Pygaster itself shows an
almost perfect abandonment of plate-complexity towards the peristome (Plate 65,
figs. 3 and 4), and there is reason to believe that the Cretaceous genera Macropygus
and Anorthopygus were even more completely simple in this respect. This may
seem a very small point of resemblance, and insufficient to serve as a basis for
morphogenetic or phylogenetic argument; but the fact remains that the later

Pygasteridee are the only Echinoids of the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous
periods in which a tendency to ambulacral simplification is seen. The Collyritidee
apparently achieved a similar result in Bajocian times.
