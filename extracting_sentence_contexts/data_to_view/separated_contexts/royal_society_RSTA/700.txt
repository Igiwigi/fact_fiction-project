(Am/A)*+ +3] = a, +b A*+6,A-*+...,
where a,, b, and c, are constants and A is the wave-length in vacuo of the incident radiation. For most gases, and in particular for air in the visible spectrum, three terms of the
expansion are sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that

(n2—1) = [ag-+b,A-2+-c,d-4] d. (6-2)

This equation and the corresponding equation for the Lorenz-Lorentz expression
(1:3), namely,

(n?—1)|(n2+2) = [a5 +bgl-2-+0,-4] d, (6-3)

are based on theoretical relations concerned with the propagation of light through a
transparent medium.
