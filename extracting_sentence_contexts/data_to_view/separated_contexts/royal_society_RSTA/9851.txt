In the first case the effect of the charge in making the
ion efficient as a condensation nucleus is increased, and in the second it is diminished. Thus the double-layer theory requires, in order to account for the observed greater
efficiency of the negative nucleus than the positive, that the negative layer on a water
drop should be next to the water and the positive layer next to the air. This we
have seen is also the arrangement of the layers to be expected from the fact that
water becomes positively charged when bubbled. In other words, this theory requires
that the sign of the charge acquired by air, when it is bubbled through a liquid,
should be the same as the sign of the charge on the more efficient nucleus for the
condensation of the vapour of that liquid. The eleven liquids mentioned on p. 471 have been found by Przreram and myself
to condense on the positive nucleus more readily than on the negative.
