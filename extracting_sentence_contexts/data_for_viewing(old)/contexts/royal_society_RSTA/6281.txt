sets relative to a second-order parameter exist), ATRp (Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion, asserting
that every arithmetical operator can be transfinitely iterated along any well-order) and 11}—CAg
(I1{-Comprehension, asserting that every 7} set exists). Aside from work in actual Reverse
Mathematics, research within the field often concerns the abstract theory of Reverse Mathematics
itself, the study of the axiomatic systems for its own sake, the study of models of the theory and
the relation between subsystems of Z2 and other systems of first- or higher-order arithmetic or of
set theory. A general reference for the subject is Simpson [3]. We also refer the reader to Dean and
Walsh [4] for an overview of the historical context of the development of Reverse Mathematics
going back to Poincaré.

(b) Ordinal Analysis

Gentzen [5] gave the first proof (two, in fact) of the consistency of number theory (more precisely,
PA). By Gédel’s theorem, such a proof must necessarily go beyond the means of arithmetic itself,
and the way this happens in Gentzen’s proof is interesting. The proof follows a direct, explicit,
inductive construction which reduces a putative proof z of a contradiction to a simpler such
proof, eventually producing a proof so simple that it can be verified directly 7 could not exist.
Each step of the induction is simple enough that it can be verified in very weak theories, such as
Primitive Recursive Arithmetic. However, the ordering over which the induction has been carried
out is very long, namely, of order-type

£0 =sup{o,@°,w ,...},

where w denotes the order-type of the natural numbers. The explanation behind the possibility
of Gentzen’s proof is that PA does not prove that the ordering ¢9 is well-founded, and thus, that
