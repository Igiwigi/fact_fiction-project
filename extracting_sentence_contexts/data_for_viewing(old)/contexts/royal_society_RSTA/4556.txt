‘likely’ range has been 1.5-4.5°C for over three
decades. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) narrowed it to 2-4.5°C, only
to reverse its decision in 2013, reinstating the prior
Author for correspondence: range. In addition, the 2013 IPCC report removed
Gernot Wagner prior mention of 3°C as the ‘best estimate’. We
interpret the implications of the 2013 IPCC decision
to lower the bottom of the range and excise a best
estimate. Intuitively, it might seem that a lower
bottom would be good news. Here we ask: when
might apparently good news about climate sensitivity
in fact be bad news in the sense that it lowers societal
well-being? The lowered bottom value also implies
higher uncertainty about the temperature increase,
definitely bad news. Under reasonable assumptions,
both the lowering of the lower bound and the removal
of the ‘best estimate’ may well be bad news.
