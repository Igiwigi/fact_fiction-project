taken as normal, we
should expect the d,,, or d,, to be normal rather than 'd,, as D,, is always weaker
than the other lines of a triplet satellite. In this case F, (0) =d,,(d,) and the
F separation = F,,(0)—F, (0) = d,,,(6,)—d,, which is less than the observed satellite
separation by about 2. As a fact we do find these diminished separations. In
searching for F lines therefore we have to examine the spectrum for wave-lengths
longer than d,, and showing as multiplets with separations the same as the satellite
separations or less. In the particular case of Kr these are 100, 105, 133, 213, 307,
1048, 1860,*
