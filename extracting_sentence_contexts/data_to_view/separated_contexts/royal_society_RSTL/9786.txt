more of iodide of silver and nearly 10
Sper cent. less of iodide of copper —(1) that the contraction takes, place through the
=same range of temperature (65* C.), beginning, however, 19* C. lower ; (2) that the
£ coefficient of expansion above the point at which contraction finishes is the same ; (3)
E that the specific gravity and fusing point are practically the same. In fact, the almost
Ss0le effect "of the additional 10 per cent. of iodide of silver has been to increase the
Zeoeſſicient of contraction between 214* C. and 280* C.
