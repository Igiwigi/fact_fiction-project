180 H. GC. WANG ON REVISION OF ZOANTHARIA RUGOSA In view of the facts cited above and as the result of my investigation of the skeletal
structures, I agree on the whole with Ogilvie that the development of the Rugosa and
Scleractinia represents a more or less continuous process, and would incline to the view of
direct descent rather than common ancestry as the true relation between these groups. Concerning the subdivision of the Rugosa, I have already remarked that the current
tendency has been to lay particular emphasis on septal insertion and septal symmetry. While the ontogenetic study of septal insertion and septal differentiation affords a valuable
aid for the understanding of phylogenetic relations, it should be admitted that our know-
ledge in this respect is confined to very few genera.
