The decomposition by platinum is-a pure contact action, in which the peroxide loses
only one equivalent of oxygen. 'The decomposition with iodine is a pure chemical
action, in which two equivalents of oxygen are given off. The action with metallic
oxides is an action compounded of these two, and therefore it is that the loss, as I have
already pointed out, eyer lies between these two limits. There are two causes by
either or by both of which this decomposition may be effected ; the one, the metallic
si]ver or other substance which is the result of the reduction; the other, the very
oxide or chloride or peroxide itself which is reduced. Certain oxides which are not
themselves reduced, can unquestionably act in this manner; and it is bighly probable
therefore that those which are reduced, and which belong to the same class of bodies,
have the same property. On this view therefore the law of the formation of the
oxygen is ever one and the same, and 80 far as relates to the chemical action of the
peroxide of barium on the metallic oxide this is ever definite. The fact therefore
which is expressed by the series of ratios is by no means any different forms of com-
bination of the particles of the oxygen with each other, but simply the way in which the
decomposition of the peroxide of barium is distributed between these different modes of
action, and the relative velocity with which these two modes of decomposition take
place. If, for example, the ratio of the loss of oxygen from the peroxide of barium to
that from the metallic oxide, be as 4 : 1, three parts of the peroxide of barium will have
been decomposed by the contact and one by the chemical action; if the ratio be as 2 : 1,
the decomposition will have taken place in equal proportions between the two. All
the phenomena are perfectly consistent with this view. As a fact, we know that the
contact, action proceeds far more rapidly at a bigh than at a low temperature ; we
need not therefore be surprised if the relative velocity of this to the chemical action
