The Leguminous plants may assimilate the free Nitrogen of the air, and thus, not,
only allow the resources of the s0il to accumulate, but also leave within it an additional
quantity, in roots and other vegetable d6bris, from that which has been assimilated, as
above supposed.

be explained according to the first of the above suppositions ; and others, to which we
shall have presently to refer, will be seen to afford confirmatory evidence on the point. With regard to the second supposed explanation, the results we have now to record
of our experiments with Leguminous plants are not of themselves sufficient to settle
every point which it involves. Reference to the Appendix will shoy that, in several
cases, we failed to get healthy growth with Leguminous plants.
