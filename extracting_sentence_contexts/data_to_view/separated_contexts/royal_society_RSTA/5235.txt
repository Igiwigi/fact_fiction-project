In these systems, the VCSELs are placed in self-imaging optical
systems with either an external grating or another VCSEL biased below lasing threshold, so that
the system becomes bistable. Lasing spots spontaneously appear in these systems and can be
switched on and off by another laser beam. As a matter of fact, broad area laser with saturable
absorber was the first system in which CSs were predicted and studied theoretically [102-104]. CSs in a monolithic optically pumped VCSEL with a saturable absorber have been demonstrated
in [105] and their switching dynamics studied in [106]. Several applications of CSs in VCSELs have
been demonstrated: optical memory [107], optical delay line [108] and optical microscopy [109].
