The stroma cells are darker in colour
and are lined by a very irregular layer of trophoblast cells. In the
middle is a section through one of the villi taken close to the surface so
that only the epithelium is cut through. The diplocaryocytes are recog-
nised by the more deeply staining quality cf their nuclei, and by the fact
that the protoplasm is drawn away from the general surrounding tissue.

one of the crypts showing the plasmodium formed by the trophoblast cells ;
the strands, processes of protoplasm, are seen to be in direct connection
with the cells of the stroma. x 900. Fig. 39. (Ovis 65.) Age full term.
