Hence the flexor profundus digitorum is segmentally posterior to the
extensor communis digitorum, not because the former is deeper than the latter, but
because the flexor aspect of the hand is posterior to the extensor aspect. I find the
palmaris longus, superficial muscle as it is, and lying in the proximal region of the
forearm as it does, is one of the most posterior muscles of the whole limb in
segmental position ; the flexor sublimis digitorum has in several observations seemed
to me to contract more vigorously than the flexor profundus on excitation of
the Ist thoracic, less vigorously than the flexor profundus on excitation of
the VIIth cervical root. The fact that so deep-lying a muscle as the pronator
quadratus gets the very posterior segmental nerve-supply recorded in my table, is
probably explicable by its lying so distally in the forearm. A difficulty is, however,
the superficial part of the intrinsic thumb muscles, which receives a, segmentally-
considered, less posterior motor innervation than the deeper intrinsic thumb muscles. The anterior position of the thumb as compared with other digits may explain this,
although the difficulty does appear to me considerable.
