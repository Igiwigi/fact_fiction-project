The bone labelled mast. pter. (ala pterotica mastoidea) can only be an ossification
of the commissura parieto-orbitalis, a view which is supported by the fact that in
Prof. Szeney’s fig. 7 (‘Q.J.G.S.,’ vol. 56, p. 648 (1900)) its anterior end is seen
to be squarely truncated and separated by a space from the squarely truncated
hinder end of the “ postfrontal,” that is the ossification in the ala orbitalis.
