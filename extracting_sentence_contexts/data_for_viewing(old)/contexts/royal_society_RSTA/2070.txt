following formula:

zpx(x) = a|x|9/?, (3.2)

where all designations correspond to expression (3.1) and x represents the spatial coordinate of a
symmetrically growing dendrite.

Physically, the scaling laws (3.1) and (3.2) are different due to the fact that the tip velocity is
much larger in the three-dimensional case than in the two-dimensional case. The latter is caused
by the fact that the heat- and mass transfer equations, as well as boundary conditions in 3D and
2D, have a different form, which is dictated by various Lam√© coefficients [32,33].

To conclude this section, we stress the fact that the Ivantsov solutions work only at the
dendritic tip and in a very small vicinity around the tip, but the scaling laws (3.1) and (3.2)
determine the shape of the neighbouring area to the dendrite tip.

4. Sewing together various tip shapes

In this section, we present the analytical expressions for dendritic shapes obtained by the method
of sewing together two different solutions: the Ivantsov parabolic shape (paraboloidal shape in
three dimensions) valid at the dendritic tip and the power law (3.1) (or the power law (3.2) in
three-dimensional case) valid at a distance of the order of several tip diameters from the dendritic
vertex.
