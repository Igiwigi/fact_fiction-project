any other accurate method, except BUNSEN's. With a temperature difference of
1:00, and reading to 0:01, the mean error cannot well be smaller than 1 per cent.,
and with the instrument in its present form, this is, in fact, the limit of error. More accurate results might be possible with a still 8maller calorimeter, and a still
more open thermometer. One poxsible objection to the use of turpentine was loss by evaporation during the
