Amongst the representative cases he investigated are the
1°S-2°S' and the 1?S—2?P transitions of atomic hydrogen for which he found K, to be 0:67
and 0-48 respectively. In general the custom is simply to assume that Kis of order (, — E,)'. The precise value is fortunately of little moment in (96) owing to the fact that K,,;,.
mately dominates the logarithmic term; but without it (97) yields only the asymptotic
variation, not the absolute magnitude. As can be seen the cross-sections for optically allowed
transitions fall off rather more slowly than those for optically forbidden transitions. Similar
conclusions are valid in the case of ions for which, of course, Coulomb waves may be used.
