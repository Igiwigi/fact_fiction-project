The mammalian fauna is quite rich and the assemblage seems to me to be definitely
of Late Pleistocene age. The two last teeth described, referred to M. nivalis/ratticeps group
and Microtus sp. (allied to M. malei) indicate late Middle Terrace forms, and I should
be tempted to regard them as derived from the break-up of some pre-existing Middle
Terrace deposit; but so far as I can see they do not differ in condition from the remainder
of the collection.

Comment on provenance (S.H.W.)

Mr Hinton writes: ‘In all my experience I have never had such a fragmentary collection
to deal with, and never such a rich one in species.’ The fragmentary condition and the
fact that some of the species are characteristic of the Crayford (Middle Terrace) stage of
the Thames valley lead him to think that some at least of the mammalian fossils have
been derived from older Pleistocene deposits in the Lea Valley. It is clearly of great
importance to determine how far these remains are in their primary position, for if they
are contemporary their occurrence in beds dated by pollen analysis proves the survival
of several typical Pleistocene species into the early Post-Glacial period.

So far as the material from ‘Surface Mx’ is concerned, the presence of undoubtedly
derived pollen grains in some samples, and also the presence of a scatter of small pebbles
seems to support the possibility of derivation of the mammalian remains, but there is
nevertheless substantial evidence in a contrary sense for the deposits as a whole. Whilst
it appears that the Lea Valley Arctic Bed would be the most likely source of derived
fossils, the vast amounts of material washed out from many sites have yielded few species
