The fact that forensic imaging does not tamper with pre-
existing structures can also be of assistance when assessing
multiple comminute fractures of, for example, the skull
after repeated blows or gunshots. At autopsy, one is forced
to pull off the scalp, which may lead to the skull fragments
dislodging, which in turn will make a painstaking and
time-consuming reconstruction of the shattered skull necess-
ary. With CT one can evaluate the fracture pattern reliably
and easily and then, due to the fact that later fracture lines
do not cross pre-existing ones, determine which blows or
gunshots occurred first. Another example is gas embolism; gas embolism diagnos-
tic is difficult at autopsy, as, by opening the body, air will
obviously enter the vascular system. For this reason, the
heart is submerged in water filled into the pericardial sac
and the cardiac chambers then punctured.
