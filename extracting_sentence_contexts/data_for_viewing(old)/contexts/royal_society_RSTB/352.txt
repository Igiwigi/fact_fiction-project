in my cabinet convinced me that the supposed new forms were merely the H. Grievii
in a younger state of growth. The specimens previously described were characterised
by the existence of a central mass composed of irregular clusters of tracheze, imbedded
amongst numerous parenchymatous cells (loc. cit., Plate 28, fig. 30, a), surrounded by
an exogenously developed zone of trachez (¢bid., b). This plant was also invested by
a well-defined zone of sclerous prosenchyma, which, in the transverse sections, was seen
to be more or less subdivided radially into cubical masses (oe. cit., fig. 30, k, and Plate
29, fig. 35, hk).

The central part of the transverse section (Plate 14, fig. 14, @) resembles the Petticur
plant in consisting of numerous clusters of tracheze aggregated into a large axial mass,
into the composition of which many parenchymatous cells enter. That these cells may
have become carbonised is probable from the fact that, when examined under a higher
power, the appearances shown in fig. 15 are observed. Two of the clusters of trachez,
enlarged 75 diameters, are here represented. In the centre of each cluster we have a
number of larger trachex, @, a, surrounded by still more numerous smaller ones, inter-
mingled with some cells, d, d. The investing zones, c, c, seem to me to be the carbonised
remains of the inter-trachezal cells which occupy similar positions in the Petticur
plant. At fig. 14, a’,a trachezeal bundle is passing outwards from the central mass to
some external appendage.

A thick cortex, fig. 14, b, b, invests these central tissues ; it is fundamentally paren-
chymatous, but the forms and arrangement of its component cells vary much in different
portions of it, as will be shown when describing longitudinal sections of this tissue.
The outer cortical zone is a layer of sclerous fibres, e, e. The aspect presented by
