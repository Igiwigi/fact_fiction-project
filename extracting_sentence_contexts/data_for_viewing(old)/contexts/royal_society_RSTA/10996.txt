x, = 61°21 French feet = 66-0 English feet,

and similarly for the half-yearly wave,
#, = 33°78 French feet = 36°0 English feet.

The depths at which the annual and half-yearly waves are reduced to an
amplitude of 0°1 F. are found in a similar way to be 45°3 and 21'4 English feet
respectively.

This paper deals with the observations of a single year, and the results accordingly
exhibit discrepancies between theory and observations which, although they are less
than might have been @ priori expected, ave greater than one would like to see.
These discrepancies are due partly to the fact that the temperature variations are
not strictly of a periodic character as the theory supposes, and as such they might
be expected to be diminished in the mean of a number of years, and partly to
irregularities, physical and formal, in the surface.

The other source of irregularity considered by Lord Kenvin in his paper, referred
to above, namely, thermometric errors arising from the uncertainty as to the tem-
perature of the liquid in the long stems of the thermometers used in Professor
