pass into the septum by an infolding of the lamella, but they can never do 0 in
considerable numbers, and take only the most insignificant part in the formation of
the 8eptum. Par the greater part of the peduncular septum, as of the radial septa,
is formed from entoderm cells alone. Misled by certain theoretical considerations, T
was ab first strongly inclined to regard the axial cells as ectodermic in origin, having
been invaginated from the exterior in a fold of the lamella. More careful study

entirely disproved this view. The entodermic origin of the axial cells is placed
beyond all doubt, by the fact that typical entodermie spicules are sometimes deyeloped
in them. These are unmistakable in form and optical characters, and are never
developed in ectoderm cells,

In its earlier stages the peduncular septum forms a complete partition, extending
from side to side, and reaching the posterior end of the body. At a later period it
becomes perforated along its sides, and at its posterior extremity by rounded openings,
which place the chambers of the peduncle in communication. The posterior opening
(fig. 155, p.) becomes very large, and the lateral openings (o.) also increase in size,
until the 8eptum has the appearance of being suspended by narrow threads from the
lateral walls of the peduncle (se figs. 181, 182). The lateral openings subsequently
become much reduced in size, or even close entirely (figs. 206, 207), but the posterior
opening remains permanently in the adult, and has been described and figured by
