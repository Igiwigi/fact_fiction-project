Penton and P. August, unpublished data). Plating satellite cells on LN-521 immediately after isolation
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) appears to fun-
damentally protect the cells from the loss of the expansion
and differentiation abilities. Penton and colleagues are inves-
tigating additional approaches that should permit enhanced
expansion and engraftment to develop advanced therapeutic
approaches for patients with muscular dystrophies. Previous studies have shown that transplanted hPSC-
derived myogenic cells can fuse with host myofibres and
improve muscle function [55].
