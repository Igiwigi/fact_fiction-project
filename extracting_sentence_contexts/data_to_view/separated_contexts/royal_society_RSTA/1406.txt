This matches our previous testing
of adhesive properties in EHA/BA/MMA PSAs, whereby increased CNC loading resulted
in a significant increase in shear strength (fourfold increase from 0 to 1wt% CNCs) [6]. Mechanistically, the increased stiffness (i.e. decrease in flow and creep) of the polymer matrix as
a result of CNC addition, due to both the rigidity of the CNCs and their ability to entangle /cross-
link with the polymer, improves the cohesive strength of the polymer matrix, leading to a high
PSA shear strength [6]. In fact, the reinforcing effect of the CNCs in this particular formulation
was so remarkable that the shear strength test specimen was manually removed from the test
surface as it did not fail of its own accord.

(b) Effect of cellulose nanocrystals on nano-adhesion of EHA/BA/MMA latex films

Colloidal probe AFM was used to study the effect of CNC loading on the adhesive nature of films
spin coated from the stock EHA/BA/MMA latex (43 wt% solids content). Figure 2a shows the
normalized force versus separation curves for the retraction of a silica probe (2.5 um in diameter)
from the surface of the latex films (measured in air). As can be seen, the maximum force required
to detach the probe from the surface of the film increases with increasing CNC loading.
