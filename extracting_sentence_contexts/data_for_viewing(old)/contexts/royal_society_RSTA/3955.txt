accuracy.

(c) Computational efficiency

Efficiency is a crucial feature of our computational approach due to the fact that water is reduced
to handling a handful of degrees of freedom per mesh node. Given a mesh voxel of ~ 1 A3, when


compared with a water molecule occupying a volume of 27 A3, the cost of handling the single 6 |
mesh node is still much more convenient than handling water explicitly via molecular dynamics

owing to the local nature of the lattice Boltzmann collisions. In fact, aggregating floating-point â€œa
operations with data movements to and from memory, one has to perform about 100 floating point : o
operations per timestep; in contrast, computing forces in molecular dynamics requires about 10 is
times more operations, even for a CG version of the solvent. : Zs
