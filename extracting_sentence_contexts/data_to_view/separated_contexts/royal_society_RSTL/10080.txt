The difficulty may, however, in a great measure
be removed by long treatment with strong glycerine, which both dissolves the greater
portion of the colouring matter from the lamella, and at the same time renders it
sufficiently transparent for a decisive observation to be made. The bast fibres of Mimosa are of peculiar interes6 with regard to this question. The middle lamellze between these cells are 80 little developed that they are re-
cognised with some difficulty, and which is an important fact, do not stain ab all. Consequently, the additional factor of difficulty, that the presence of a well-developed
middle lamella involves, is here done away with. Each bast cell is freely pitted, the
pits of neighbouring cells being placed symmetrically opposite one another.
