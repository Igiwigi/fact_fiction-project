so that on writing as usual « for (dI/dH)a, we have dy'/dI = — I (d«-/dQ)y +
2QdM—!/dI. This is the exact equation which should be directly satisfied by series
of observations of 7’, I, and M, formed with different constant values of H and Q,
provided hysteresis is negligible. As y’ must be an even function of I, it follows that
when I and Q are small, y’ = — $1? (d«7!/dQ)y, or $F (d«7!/dQ),, as in § 67.

For the case of a ring magnetized by a coil, there can be no free polarity except
at an air-gap; thus there is no stress of magnetic origin in the material. The
alterations of longitudinal and transverse dimensions of rings of iron and nickel*
are thus wholly intrinsic changes due to the magnetic polarity and in no part due
to mechanical stress such as Q. In the neighbourhood of the origin, where 7’ is
proportional to I?, the curves given by BmweLt expressing the relation between
n and I should be parabolic, as in fact they ave. At the magnetization corre-
sponding to a maximum or minimum ordinate 7’ of the curve, the effect of a
very small imposed tension on the magnetization should change sign, being null for
that particular magnetization ; the summit of the curve is therefore the Viniart
critical point. But if there is a tension Q so considerable that change of the elastic
modulus by magnetization contributes appreciably to the elongation, the VitLari
point will be displaced from the summit of the curve, backwards when magnetization
increases the modulus. It appears from the experiments of Browernt that for iron
tension increases the intrinsic clongation, for nickel it at first increases then
sensible effect.
