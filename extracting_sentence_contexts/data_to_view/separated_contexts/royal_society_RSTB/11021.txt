The concept of our recently
proposed, apoptosis-driven ‘onco-regenerative niche’ (ORN)
[6] will be developed with particular reference to the roles of

apoptosis-responsive tumour-associated macrophages (TAM)
and of apoptotic tumour cell-derived extracellular vesicles
(Apo-EV) (figure 2).

2. Tissue repair responses to apoptosis:
phagocytic and anti-inflammatory effects

Classically, apoptosis contrasts with non-programmed, necro-
tic cell death in failing to incite inflammatory responses and
providing tolerogenic signals to the adaptive immune system
[24] (although, under certain circumstances, apoptosis can be
immunogenic, and necrosis can also be programmed—see
[25-27] for recent reviews). In fact, the best-known responses to
apoptotic cells are described as anti-inflammatory, character-
ized by the production of anti-inflammatory mediators, such
as TGF-B1, IL-10 and PGE, which are associated with suppres-
sion or resolution of inflammatory responses [24,28,29]. The
non-phlogistic nature of apoptosis is reflected in the absence
of inflammatory effects of the process during normal physi-
ology. For example, in the thymus, an organ in which the
vast majority of the cells it produces undergo apoptosis,
the process is histologically virtually invisible.
