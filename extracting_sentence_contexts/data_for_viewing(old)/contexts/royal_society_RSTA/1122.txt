the others. Thus, one can check that the 0-th equation in (3.12), the total energy conservation law,
is a linear combination of the remaining equations

Vi (Eu ug + ph'y + P'o) = -a Vy (Eu uj + ph’, +P’) — “0 u"(WyAl, — Vu As)

Wn

— Sy Vulsul + E,) — Fe (w (Vato — Vater) + 1,Qx) — Valo), (3.2)

where P',, = Alay + WpEw, + 9° Up + U"qu. The source terms in (3.1) are designed in such a way
that they canceled out during the summation (3.2), that is the total energy is indeed conserved.

Finally, we note that the rest mass conservation law (3.1e) is, in fact, not an independent
equation, but can be derived from the configuration gradient (2.12)2 or distortion evolution
equation (3.1b), e.g. [44]. Nevertheless, it is convenient to formally treat the rest mass density
p:= polAl/,/—g as an independent variable [44], which should be taken into account in the
derivatives Ena and &,. Here, po is the reference mass density.

(c) Closure: equation of state

As we have seen, the SHTC system of governing equations is formulated without specifying the
Lagrangian density £ or energy &. We say that the energy potential & is the generating potential
for system (3.1) which has to be specified in order to close the system.

Because & has to be a proper scalar, it has to depend on the tensor fields via their invariants,
