This contradiction proves the
theorem. In all those cases, specified on p. 313, in which Mahler proved K to be boundedly reducible,
the same argument, with theorem L’ in place of theorem L, shows that K is also fully reducible. Mahler’s proof is, in each case, based on the fact that every critical lattice of K is of the form
QA,, where Qis an automorphism of K and A, is a certain special critical lattice. His argument
proves the existence of a bounded star body K* contained in K with the property that every
lattice A*, which is admissible for K* and which is sufficiently near to Ag, is either a critical
lattice of K or has determinant greater than A(K). Thus A, is fully critical, and so every
critical lattice of K is fully critical; consequently it follows from theorem L’ that K is fully
reducible.
