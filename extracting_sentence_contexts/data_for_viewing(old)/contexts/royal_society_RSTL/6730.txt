& According to FRIEDEL, oil of bitter almonds unites with hydrogen and forms benzylic
2 alcohol; and the experiments described in this paper show glyoxylic acid to enter into
'& combination with this element, forming glycolic acid.

Glyoxylic acid. Glycolic acid.

Glycolic acid may therefore be termed the alcohol of oxalic acid, and glyoxylic acid
the aldehyde of both; in fact glyoxylic acid possesses other properties which are gene-
rally only found in connexion with aldehydes. Amongst these are the great affinity of
glyoxylates for sulphites (whereby well-defined and beautifully crystallizing compounds
are formed), the exchange of the oxygen of the acid for the sulphur of sulphuretted
hydrogen, and, finally, the production of compounds with ammonia.

Glyoxylic acid may likewise be compared with various other bodies; it has, for
instance, in many respects @ resemblance to sulphurous acid.
