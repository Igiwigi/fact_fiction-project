Two total experimental situations are incompatible if and only if they correspond to
different contexts, i.e. different equivalence classes in the sense of measuring sets of physical
magnitudes symbolized by non-commuting (operator) observables. Bohr put this as follows.
‘These circumstances find quantitative expression in Heisenberg’s indeterminacy relations which
specify the reciprocal latitude for the fixation, in quantum mechanics, of kinematical and
dynamical variables required for the definition of the state of a system in classical mechanics
itself. In fact, the limited commutability of the symbols by which such variables are represented
in the quantal formalism corresponds to the mutual exclusion of the experimental arrangements
required for their unambiguous definition’ [18, p. 5]. As a consequence, propositions regarding
quantum properties are complementary to specific other sets of propositions, precluding their
joint sharp attribution due to the linear structure of the state space: every pure state is a nontrivial
linear combination of eigenvectors of observables with which the associated one-dimensional
projection fails to commute. Thus, for example, spatial position is almost indeterminate when the
momentum is specified in the limit of perfect precision, and vice versa.
