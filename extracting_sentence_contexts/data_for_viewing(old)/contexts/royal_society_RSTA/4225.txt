Its statements deal only with the object-subject relation’. However, he continued, ‘this holds, after
all, for any description of nature’; the crucial point is that, in quantum physics, it ‘holds in a much
more radical and far reaching sense’ [17].

In classical mechanics, the mass of an object is a basic property which that object has whether
or not a physicist is nearby to be interested in it. Let us imagine a physicist working in the days
before quantum theory. He drops a rock on his foot and sees red—a subjective perception. He
then uses this perception, which is part of his ‘inner life’, to rule out the hypothesis that the rock
is of negligible mass. The variable m in his equations refers to an intrinsic property of the rock,

2The mathematical point of the multiplicity of ensemble decompositions was made most famously by Hughston ef al. [61] in
1993. It was also demonstrated almost 60 years earlier by Schrédinger [62], who disclaimed priority for the result, suggesting
that some form of the idea was folk knowledge or shared conversationally at the time. The fact that a mixed state can be
decomposed in multiple ways is one of the phenomena reproduced in the ‘epistricted’ models of Spekkens [63,64].

5Democritus, fragment DK 68B9, which comes to us via Sextus Empiricus, Against the Mathematicians (ca 200), 7.136. The
translation in K. Freeman’s Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers [65] is, ‘We know nothing accurately in reality, but [only]
as it changes according to the bodily condition, and the constitution of those things that flow upon [the body] and impinge
upon it’.

‘Lucretius, De Rerum Natura (ca 60-50 BCE), Book IV. The relevant passage begins with, ‘Invenies primis ab sensibus esse
creatam / notitiem veri neque sensus posse refelli’ [You will find the knowledge of truth is created first by the senses, and the
senses cannot be denied].
