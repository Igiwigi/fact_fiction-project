It is improbable that this trapping had had any beneficial effects on survival
in lines 9 to 15; moreover, on block F, which was also trapped in December, the rate of
decrease was the fastest of all. These variations in death-rate were not explained by an
unequal distribution of males. In fact, the only difference suggested is that in May 1937
voles may have been rather more crowded on block Â£ than on block Q (see below); but
there was no obvious difference between the two sections of block Q in population density
during the breeding season. TABLE 15. NUMBER OF VOLES TRAPPED IN THE TWO SECTIONS
OF BLOCK Q (1937-8)
