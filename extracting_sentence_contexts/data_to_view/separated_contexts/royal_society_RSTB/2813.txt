Even the dichotomy seen in the relatively small
leaves of certain other Pteridophytes (Archwocalamites, Psilotacese, Sphenophyllez)
may perhaps find its counterpart in the dichotomy which is so frequent in the first
leaves of young Ferns.*

Again, the Leptosporangiate Ferns show a very distinctive mode ot segmentation,
both of apex and margin of the leaf; but I have shown elsewhere that in this character
the Osmundace form an intermediate step from them to the Marattiaces, while

the latter diverge clearly from the Leptosporangiate type, and show that in detail
those definite cell-nets of the Leptosporangiate type are not essential characters of
Fern-leaves at large.* These facts point to the justness of the conclusion that the
Fern-leaf, however different in size, continued apical growth, and even in its segmenta-
tion is essentially comparable to the smaller and simpler leaves of the strobiloid forms. It would appear @ priori reasonable to assume that in the first instance the larger-
leaved were derived from a smaller-leaved ancestry. On the other hand, there is a chain of evidence to show that certain of the
Gymnosperms originated from a larger-leaved Cyeado-filicinean ancestry.t It must
not, therefore, be assumed that all small-leaved forms were so derived, or that all large-
leaved forms were of prior origin, though morphological argument has frequently
proceeded on this assumption.{ The middle position is probably nearest to the truth,
viz., that while in the first instance smaller-leaved forms gave rise to the larger-leaved
plants which we call “ Ferns,” conversely, certain of the latter may, along lines of
reduction, have eventuated in smaller-leaved Gymnospermic types.
