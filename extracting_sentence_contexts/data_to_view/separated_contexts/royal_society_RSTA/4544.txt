That the positive ions do not arise in
the space outside the free metal surface appears to be distinetly indicated by the
following considerations. We have seen that the positive and negative ionisations from hot platinum vary
with the temperature according to the same kind of law, but quite independently of
one another. This is exemplified by the fact that at a pressure of 1°5 millims. of
oxygen the two leaks are equal to one another at about 1230° C., whereas at 700° C.
the saturation current with the wire negative is about 1077 of its value with the wire
positive. The disparity between the two leaks points strongly to the view that they
are the result of separate actions; it proves, in addition, that there is no considerable
amount of volume ionisation, but it does not prove that the ions are not formed
outside the wire.
