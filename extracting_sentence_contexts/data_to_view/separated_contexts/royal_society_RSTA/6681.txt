The differences between our notation and that used by Love and by Bancroft are shown
in table 11-4. The remainder of the notation agrees with that used by Love and by Bancroft. No confusion need arise from the fact that y, A and C are here used to denote respectively
2n/A and constants connected with the amplitude of vibration, whereas they have been used
in preceding sections to denote change in capacity, area of cross-section and capacity. TABLE 11-4
