method. of describing a conic. hyperbola, and then finding its

finding the curve, and the remaining parts.

PROP. II. PORISM. oa
A conic hyperbola being given; a point may be found, such,
that if from it there be drawn straight lines to all the intersec-
tions of the given curve, with an infinite number of parabolas,
or | hyperbolas, ' of any given" order whatever, lying between
straight lines, of which one /passes through a given point, and
the other may be found, the straight-lines 80 drawn, from the.
point found, shall be tangents to the parabolas, or hyperbolas.
This is in fact two propositions ; there being a' construction.
for the case of parabolas, and another-for that of hyperbolas.
PROP. II. PORISM.
If, through any point whatever of a given eb; a tenight
line be drawn” parallel-to the conjugate axis, and” cutting the
ellipse- in another point; and if at the first point a perpendi-
cular be drawn to the parallel, a point may be found, such, that
if from it there be drawn straight lines, to the innumerable
