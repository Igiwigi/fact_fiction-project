GENERAL SUMMARY. The © fundamental experiment” of paralyzing nectocalyces by removing their margin
has this year been repeated a vast number of times on various species of naked-eyed
Medusz, and always with the same result. In the case of the covered-eyed Medux, I
have confirmed 8uch of my previous observations as required confirmation, from the fact
of their having been at variance with those of Dr. E1xer. I have continued to find that
the lithocysts are the exclusive seats of spontaneity, s0 ſar as the © primary movements ”
are concerned, I have failed to detect the slightest evidence of spontaneity on the part
of the contractile zones.
