The full-grown parasite larva
remains as such within its cocoon for several months, even though conditions are favourable
for further development. Then, as with those individuals developing without the inter-
vention of diapause, a prepupa and pupa are formed followed by the emergence of the
adult parasite. In these experiments freshly emerged females were mated with males several days old
(mating was not always successful as is shown by the fact that a few of the females produced
only male progeny). These females were then kept individually in small cages, 44 x 44 x 24 in.,
which were of wood with cheese cloth back and sides and a sliding celluloid front. No
variations in temperature were made, all being kept at 75Â° F, but, since apparently very
little feeding on the host occurs, the diet of the adult females was varied.
