The ray cells are thin-walled in both, and
unpitted on the horizontal and terminal walls as well. Araucariopitys has, on the
other hand, thick-walled and pitted medullary ray cells, “as is typically the case in
the Abietinez.” Besides the pitting and medullary ray structure being more Cordaitean in the
older form reference has been made above to the fact that, according to JerrREy’s
view, the traumatic resin canals should be better developed here also, whereas they
are apparently absent (not reported) in Woodworthia, but are well developed in
Araucariopitys. In connection with this feature the writer would call attention to
the many evidences of traumatic resin canals in the oldest fossil representatives of the
Abietinere. Conwentz (1890) in his monograph on the Amber pines (Pinus
succinifera) devotes considerable space to it and figures one traumatic series with 13
canals in it.
