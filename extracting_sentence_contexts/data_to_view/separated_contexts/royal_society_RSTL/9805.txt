Mer.cnron (60), 1859, in his dissertation dealt chiefly with the pathology of the
thymus,

TuRXER (61), 1860, noticed a thymus in an adult Porpoise and in an adult Antelope. HirzeL and FRey (62), 1863, wrote on the hibernating gland. They noticed the
fact that if these glands are exposed to the air they assume a dark red-brown colour. K6L11KER (54), 1863, adhered in great measure to his former yiew. He described
the star-shaped cell network in the follicles, and noticed large cells with multiple
nuclei, He confirmed the fact observed by HewsoN (10) and His (46), that the
lymphatic vessels contain very many corpscules, similar to those of the thymus, and
described the simple concentric corpuscles as having a granular mass in their interior ;
he did not think that they arise from the gland cells.
