From the circular muscle bundles scattered fibres run radially inwards a
distance into the mucosa, they are not numerous and are irregularly placed, |
existence, however, prevents the mucosa being sharply marked off from the m
layer as Mrvor (47) describes for the uterus of the human female. i

Outside the inner layer is an external layer of muscles, chiefly composed of bu
of longitudinal fibres, but between them are smaller bundles disposed in a cire
direction.

Outside the longitudinal layer of muscles is a thin layer, represented by a d
line in fig. 12, which is only superficially different from the external layer of mu
by reason of the fact that it does not stain so deeply.

It is composed of scattered fibres of longitudinal and circular muscles, with a
connective tissue cells, the whole embedded in a gelatinous material, and coy
outside with a layer of flattened epithelium. I have called this layer the sheath.

All the muscles are non-striated muscles.

The cerviv.â€”At the cervix end or posterior end of the body of the uterus,
stroma layer becomes thinner and gradually merges into a tissue in which the n
are more scattered and an intercellular substance is present. This tissue is m
more dense than the stroma of the body of the uterus, The glands are short and
epithelium lining the cavity of the cervix is cubical.
