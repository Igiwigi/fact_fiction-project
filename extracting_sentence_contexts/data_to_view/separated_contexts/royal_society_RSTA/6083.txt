However,
this phenomenon of complexity emerging from simplicity is not conceptually mysterious, and is
already well-understood mathematically. Another use of the term ‘emergence’ comes from thinking about joint effects, which is a ‘whole
versus parts’ emergence. Ultimately, this is motivated by the fact that elements in a system can
exhibit behaviour, dynamics or functions that would not take place if they were partitioned or
isolated from the rest of the system. One such measure that captures how much information is
lost by partitioning individual elements off from a given system is Integrated Information Theory
[54,55]. However, the mere fact that joint sets of elements behave differently compared to isolated
elements in terms of effects or information flow does not by itself capture what is lost by reduction
to some lower scale of explanation.
