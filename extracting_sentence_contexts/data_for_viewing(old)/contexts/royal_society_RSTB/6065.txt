living and fossil Primates (’02, 03, ‘08), which are in fundamental agreement with my
own, and also to the conclusions of W. K. Grecory arrived at after comprehensive
surveys of the morphological and paleontological evidence and summarised in his
tentative scheme of the phylogeny of the Primates (’27, fig. 10) which likewise afford
striking confirmation of the views I have reached quite independently.

Nevertheless, I fully recognise that there are many matters, both of fact and theory,
still to be elucidated before the problem of the phylogeny of the Primates ceases to be
of interest to the student of Mammalian descent. Our problem, like that which exercised
the learned Dr. Croonz,} when he found as he supposed, the embryo Chick fully formed,
inside the new-laid egg is ‘“ one which we can nowhere with any certainty or only after
a long time attain to perfect knowledge.”
