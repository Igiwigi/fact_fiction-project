together, the current may lead the generator electromotive force, or may lag and the
motor may lag by any amount from 90° to 270°. Regarding the relative phases of
electromotive force of machines and of current, the machine is a generator when the
current is from 0° to 90° behind the machine ; it is a motor from 90° to 270°, and again
a generator from 270° to 360°. We have already stated that we should naturally
expect that the induced currents in the magnets would have little or no effect when
E.M.F. and current were in the same phase, and that they would have a maximum
effect when the two were 90° apart, or at quarter centres. We should expect further
that, as a generator can be made into a motor by reversing the current in the
armature, wherever local currents diminish E.M.F. of a generator, they would
increase E.M.F. of a motor. That is, we should expect that local currents would
diminish E..M.F. from lead 0° to 180°, and increase E.M.F. from 180° to 860°. As a
fact, we find this to be partially verified; it seems that local currents diminish
E.M.F. from a negative angle of comparative small amount, perhaps 30°, to consider-
ably more than 90°, and that they increase E.M.F. from 180° to over 270°.

Referring to the curves in fig. 14, « and E, are in phase, and Je, dt would need
increasing 3 per cent. to meet JE, dt, when « vanishes Ey lags 216°, and Jey dt needs
diminishing, that is the currents have increased the E.M.F. In fig. 15 a very small
change in the observations would change the character of the results.

We have taken another set of curves shown in figs. 19 and 20. In fig. 19, we
have a very small current 3°3 amperes in the generator magnets, and the current is
in phase with the generator, the motor being 264° behind the current. The generator
is about 12 per cent. low owing to local currents, and the motor is 25 per cent. of
