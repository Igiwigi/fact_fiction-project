It may be safely stated, therefore, that what is ordinarily called red, is distinctly
visible to my colour-blind eye, not as an individual colour, but as a shade of yellow. * These quantities are only given approximately to illustrate the fact ; they are very difficult to get accu-
rately. The proportions by mixing powders are very different to those required by rotation to produce the
ame hue ; and eyen when this has been tolerably arrived at, the quality of the pigments has much influence
on the appearance of the match. MR. W. POLE ON COLOUR-BLINDNESS.
