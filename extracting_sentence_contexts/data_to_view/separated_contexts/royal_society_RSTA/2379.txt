Similarly, J lies
on the cubic curve determined by its total synaptic input stot, denoted by %,,,, as shown
in figure 3b. Note in figure 3a that the s;=1 nullcline (C;) lies above the s;=0 nullcline
(Co), while in figure 3b, the stot =1 nullcline (7) lies below the sto¢=0 nullcline (J). These
relations result from the fact that the E; receive inhibition from J while J receives excitation
from the E;.
