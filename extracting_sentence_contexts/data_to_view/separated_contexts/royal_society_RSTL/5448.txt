Again, to compare the general equation with that previously obtained for parallel rays
refracted at a circle, we must write =], c=1, a=, Z=hk (for the equation of the
refracted ray was taken to be Xx>+Yy+k=0); we have then

a=] +P+PO, A=SYe, m=a.(1+(1+Þ)"),

and after the substitution 4=o. The equation becomes in the first instance
P+2X{a(l+(L4+#P)&O)P—WoX)+(+Y)a(1+(1 +PWYe—yrox}
—PY(L+P+PO+2[PQX)=0 ;

and then putting a=<o, or, what is the same thing, attending only to the terms which
involve a, and throwing out the constant factor &*, we obtain

(X2+Y?)(X2—1—FY— 4/Y*=0,
or

X(X?—1—PY+Y(X+1+hX—1—b)(X+1—b(X—1-F#)=0,

which agrees with the former result

XL. It was remarked that the ordinary construction for the secondary caustic could not
be applied to the case of parallel rays (the entire curve would in fact pass off to an
infinite distance), and that the simplest conurse was to measure the distance GQ from a
line through the centre of the refracting circle perpendicular to the direction of the
rays. To find the equation of the resulting curve, take the centre of the circle as the
origin and the direction of the incident rays for the axis of z; let the radius of the circle
be taken equal to unity, and let p denote, as before, the index of refraction. Then if «, B
are the coordinates of the point of incidence of a ray, we have «*+8*=1, and consider-
ing «, 3 as variable parameters connected by this equation, the required curve is the
envelope of the circle,

wile—eY+(y—BY} —&*=0.
