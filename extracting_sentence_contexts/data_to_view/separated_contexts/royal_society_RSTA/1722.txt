Eventual positivity

While positivity of semigroups is a ubiquitous phenomenon in analysis, it might come as a
surprise at first glance that some evolution equations exhibit only eventually positive rather than
positive behaviour. We say that a semigroup S on our Banach lattice E is eventually positive if there
exists a time fo > 0 such that S(t) > 0 for all t > to; this does not assume (nor does it imply) that
S(t) is positive for small times. In fact, the property that we just described should more precisely
be called uniform eventual positivity, since there exists a single time from which on all operators
are positiveâ€”in contrast to the situation where the single orbits become eventually positive for
positive initial value, but where the time when this happens depends on the initial value (see
[50, Example 5.7] for an example which shows that this can indeed occur). Here is a simple criterion for eventual positivity of self-adjoint semigroups. Theorem 7.1.
