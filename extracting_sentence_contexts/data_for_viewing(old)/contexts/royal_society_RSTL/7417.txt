but whilst we have here a radiate arrangement, which may also be considered bilateral,
this approach to a bilateral symmetry is disturbed by the fact that the czxophageal canal
in the Nematoids is almost invariably triquetrous, that the number of teeth in the phas
ryngeal cavity of the free Nematoids, when s8uch exist, is generally three, and that the
8ame number applies to the cephalic lobes of the Ascarides, and a multiple of it to thoss
of the Spiroptere. Ag another notable instance of deviation from a bilateral symmetry,
may be cited the remarkably unsymmetrical distribution of the peculiar transverse pairs
of yessels existing in some members of the genus AscarisF.

By reason of these various resemblances, though more especially on account of the
remarkable identity in the structure and arrangement of their nervous systems, I think
it most in accordance with the nature of ascertained facts to look upon the Nematoids
as close allies of the Echinodermata—more closely allied to them, in fact, than to the

Secolecida. Whilst, however, it would be difficult to assign to the order Nematoides &
zoological position in either of these classes, there can be little doubt that their organi
zation—uniting as it does, in a remarkable manner, some of the chief characteristics of

T Murxen's Archiy, According to the descriptions given by Murzsxem, the departure from the bilateral and
prevalence of a ternary arrangement must be till more striking amongst the Gordiace, since he dogcribes 1
these animals three great longitudinal muscles instead of four, alternating with threo cellular bands apparently
homologous with the lateral bands of the Nematoids,
