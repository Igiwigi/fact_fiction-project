thickness, which laterally passes over without definite limit into the adjoining thin
sheets of primitive streak mesoderm. The cells contain deeply staining chromatophilic
granules which resemble those described by Boner (1901, p. 287) in the “ Ergiinzungs-
platte ” of the dog, and they are also present in the minute intercellular spaces. In
places the cells tend to be arranged round small cavities (one in section 24, two in
section 27, fig. 32, Plate 32, and one in section 28, fig. 33, Plate 32), but these vesicles
are too indistinct and too irregularly distributed to have any important significance.

The thickened endoderm continued back from the prochordal plate can be traced
on either side of the head-process up to section 27 and, as in the preceding sections,
is fused with the head-process in the median line. Caudally to this section the
thickened endoderm area becomes indistinct, and behind section 34 is certainly no longer
present. The possible explanation of these facts we shall discuss later in connection
with the description of the same region in other human embryos (v. p. 482).

Tn section 30 (fig. 34, Plate 32) the head-process has become reduced, both in thickness
and in width, as compared with that of the preceding sections, whilst its cells present
a somewhat looser appearance, and the chromatophilic granules have almost completely
disappeared. The next section (No. 31, fig. 35, Plate 32) presents a very similar
appearance, except that there are no granules and the axial mass is more massive.
In both sections no distinct endoderm can be observed below the head-process.

Section 32 (fig. 36, Plate 32) marks the beginning of our intermediate region, since
in it we encounter the tip of the chorda-process in the form of a compact circular mass,
situated asymmetrically on the left side* and composed of cells radially arranged round
