The separation —¢ is given on the value calculated from the formula, In m = 4 the observed is 2°6
larger than the calculated, pointing to too small a value for the limit, which is quite possible as the limit
determined from lines involving S(1) = —P(1) is never found correctly. An increase of this order
makes the —e link in $,(5) normal. It gives the line in the table with dA = — -08.


DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 349

It is most important to get evidence which can carry conviction as to the reality of
displaced lines, especially where the displacements occur simultaneously on both limit
and sequent. A numerical coincidence in this case can have little weight by itself.
In fact, it can have weight only in each particular case provided it is known from
other considerations that such displacements are a common and universal rule. For
this purpose it is instructive to adduce here some striking evidence afforded by certain
sets of lines connected with the S series. The lines in question are arranged in the

two following schemes, expressed in wave-numbers :—

—(1) 42844 (3) 42059 (8) 41496
123-00 124-53 , 122-92

(2) 49721 252-37 S,(1)  -(1) 41985 252-94 S.(1) —(1) 41625 25230 S’s(1)
