The model uses goal-oriented supervised DNN with an overall cessed and forwarded to an objective function that specifies the
architecture designed to match the neurophysiological and struc- goal of the system, in our case a discriminative classification of
tural characteristics of the retino-collicular network. At its core, emotional facial expressions. During training, the strength of
the model is composed of three main stages (figure 1). connections between units is learned by the system based on

First, we designed a front-end that reproduces retinal func- experience rather than handcrafted by the researcher. The behav-
