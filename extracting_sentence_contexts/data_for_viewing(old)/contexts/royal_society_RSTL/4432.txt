in different parts of the same fibre, being alternately large and small ; at their extre-
mities they taper off to a very fine point ; their colour is yellowish, and when minutely
examined, they appear to be made up of very small irregular granules and extremely
slender threads blended together without any definite arrangement (see fig. 4). Acted
upon by acetic acid they give no indication whatever of being nucleated, therefore in
this respect they differ from the common form of organic muscular fibre*. The two
Kinds of fibres, represented in figs. 3 and 4, were both drawn under the same magni-
fying power, in order to show, by a comparison of their dimensions, that the increase
which takes place in the individual fibres in these different states of the nterus, is
quite sufficient to account for the amount of augmentation of the entire organ, with-
out snpposing, as some physiologists do, that organic muscular fibres, not present in
the inactive state of the uterus, are absolutely formed during the various stages of its
enlargement ; it also, besides being supported by the fact just stated, perfectly accords
with the laws of development, and harmonizes with the changes which are going on
simultaneously in the walls of the impregnated uterus and its contents ; the unim-
pregnated uterus being, according to this notion, little more than an assemblage of
embryonic nucleated fibres, wholly inactive, until after the reception of the ovum,
when, being aroused by an appropriate stimulus, they are called into active operation,
and become developed simultaneously and proportionally to the development of the
foetus contained within it, 80 that when the one has arrived at a state requiring to be
expelled, the other has acquired the utmost degree of fitness necessary to effect its
expulsion. Now after the expulsion of the fcetus, since, according to the laws of de-

* Professor K6L11xKEs has described the fibres both of the unimpregnated and impregnated uterus. The
latter he has described and figured as having nuclei, which I haye never been able to verify although I have
