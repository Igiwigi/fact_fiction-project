The terrace deposits along this tributary valley are astonishing,
particularly at Stretton-on-Dunsmore where wide relics of No, 4 are preserved 45 ft. above
the stream. They lie in actual height above the level of the same terrace on the Leam or
the Avon and are separated from the second river by the unbroken Dunsmore ridge, so
that they cannot be explained by any theory involving an ancient course of either main
river. They are, in fact, what they appear to be, the deposits of the tributary which has
its source just west of the Blue Boar, the centre of the radiating drainage of the Dunsmore
plateau. The terrace gravels must therefore be derived from Dunsmore gravels of the
immediate neighbourhood. It is amazing that at a distance of only 2 miles from the source
of the stream the gravel plain of No. 4 times must have had a width of 900 yards.
