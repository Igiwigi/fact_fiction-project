For example, in the Mackey—Glass equation, we have
f(x, Xr) = Bx, /(1 + x) — yx with the fixed parameters f, 1 and y. To capture the effects of the
time delay one needs a description which takes the history of the system into account, and
thus requires a dynamical system with an infinite-dimensional phase space. In fact, it turns
out that the state of the DDE (1.1) at time f¢ is given by the function x(@), 6 €[t—1,t] (see
[3,4] for the mathematical theory on DDEs). Therefore, DDEs such as equation (1.1) are able to
produce extremely complex behaviour and bifurcation scenarios. For example, albeit its relatively
simple scalar description, the Mackey—Glass equation shows periodic, aperiodic as well as chaotic
behaviour.
