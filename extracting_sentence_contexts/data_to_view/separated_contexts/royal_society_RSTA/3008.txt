This value of D makes the thickness of the double layer
2x 107* centim. instead of 2°6x 10~%, and with it Q’ log (D/A) is nearly as constant
as with the value used. In fact, the possible error in D is at least a factor of 10, so
that the difficulty about the specific heat is not very serious in the case of platinum
if the value of p,, deduced from the negative leak, is taken. 10. Conclusion.
