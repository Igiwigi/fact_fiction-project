This experience is general among
the colour-blind, who one and all identify blue and yellow as the colours about which
they are most certain, and which they never run the slightest risk of confounding with
each other. 11. The fact next in importance is, that my ideas of the third primary colour, red, do
not agree with those of the normal-eyed. The term red is 80 indefinite, in ordinary language, that I have had much trouble to
find out by an example, what is usually considered the pure colour, free from yellow
on the one hand, or blue on the other. Many well-educated persons differ much on
this point, and I have myself often detected considerable variation between examples
of red which normal-eyed people have declared to correspond.
