It was found that no colours were visible, the whole area occupied by the holes being a grey
colour. Variations in the ratio of reduction, which were made by changing the focal length
of the objective, had no noticeable effect. In the above experiments, one fact was observed which will require further experiments
for its elucidation. It will be remembered, when a grating consisting of yellow and blue
lines was examined at a distance, that the colours neutralized one another, yellow changing
to pale grey or white, while blue became dark grey or black, according to tint. The same
change occurs with a grating of red and blue-green lines; in this case it is the red lines
which change to dark grey or black, and the blue-green lines which become pale grey
or white.
