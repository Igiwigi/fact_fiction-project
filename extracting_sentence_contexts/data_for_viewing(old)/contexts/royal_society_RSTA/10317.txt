termination of what is considered to be the hottest zone of the flame, namely, the
part surrounding the blue cone and which appears to the eye to be more luminous
than the other portions. The third horizontal strip, corresponding to the highest
portions of the flame, contains only the strongest lines of the principal series of the
metal standing out from a completely dark background.

In the case of other metals whose more complex spectra have not yet been divided
into series, considerable differences have been found, as the tables show, in the
intensities of one and the same line depending upon whether this line has been
produced in the neighbourhood of the base or in the upper regions of the flame.
Certain of their lines even exist only in the neighbourhood of the blue cone. It is
very probable that an examination of the relative lengths of the lines and of their
appearance would result in the determination of new series. In fact, in the spectrum
of the alkaline metals and of those metals whose flame spectra do contain known
series, a complete analogy is seen in the appearances of those lines whose wave-lengths
are connected with one another by some numerical relation. I have elsewhere (p. 160)
pointed out in the flame spectrum of chromium the presence of two triplets which
are probably members of the same series.

If we now compare the flame spectra thus produced with those of the are and the
spark, it will be noticed that as a rule the lines which are found in the flame spectrum
are those which are the strongest lines in the are spectrum. In certain cases, some of
the more intense are lines are absent, whereas less intense arc lines are to be found in
the flame spectrum, On the other hand, none of the characteristic lines of the spark
