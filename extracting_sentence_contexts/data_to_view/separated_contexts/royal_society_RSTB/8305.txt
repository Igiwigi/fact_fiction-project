Here standardized Bateman gradients (i.e. with mean set to unity) illustrate four scenarios (a—d),
with dashed lines for males and solid lines for females. A steeper slope denotes a stronger directional selection for mating success. (a) When males have a steeper
slope, we expect conventional sex-roles (sensu [16], i.e. that males are the sex that predominantly competes for partners) to arise and (b) reversed sex-roles (that
females are the sex that predominantly competes for partners) when females have the steeper slope. More troublesome when it comes to ‘sex-role’ terminology is
the fact that both sexes can show similar directional selection for mating success, with (c) steep or (d) shallow slopes in both sexes.

can also depend on number of mates, because of direct and for these traits. Because a larger number of mates translate
indirect benefits, and because of effects of genetic diversity directly into a higher reproductive success for the females,
