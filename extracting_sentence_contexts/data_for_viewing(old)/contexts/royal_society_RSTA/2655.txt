The five identical container ships belong to the Postpanamax-Class (figure 4c) and remained
anonymous in the data source. They have a capacity of 8240 twenty-foot equivalent units and are


powered by a slow-speed 2-stroke engine with an average speed of 20.5 knots and an average fuel
consumption of 329 kg per nautical mile [48]. The total emission values as well as the calculated
possible savings in the three scenarios for this ship class are given in electronic supplementary
material, table S1 in the supplementary information. Our calculations showed possible fuel
savings of 10.69kg to 42.77kg and cost savings of 6.09 US$ to 24.38 US$ per nautical mile in
the three scenarios for this ship class.

For this ship class, we calculated the values for a fictional journey TA2—Eastbound (Baltimore,
USA to Bremerhaven, Germany) of around 6800 nautical miles (one way) [49]. The calculated
possible fuel savings for this journey are between 72709.0 and 290836.0kg, meaning CO -
emission savings between 227 579.2 and 910316.7 kg and cost savings of 41 444.1 US$ to 165 776.5
US$. The detailed results for the three scenarios are given in electronic supplementary material,
table S2.

(d) Ultra large container vessel Emma Maersk

The ULCV Emma Maersk was built in 2006 as the first of eight identical container ships owned
by the A.P. Meller-Maersk Group. She has a dead weight tonnage of 156907 tons and can carry
up to 15000 twenty-foot equivalent units. She was holding the record for the world’s largest
ship and still holds the record for the world’s largest and most powerful reciprocating engine: a
