Turing’s classical 1930s work on machine computation, and the balance
yetween program and information. Quoting Feferman’s reference to
he oracle Turing machine as a ‘new idea that was to change the face
of the general theory of computation’, Soare traces the historical anc
contemporary significance of the oracle machine over a range of fields.
The article by Jones & Simonsen [2] discusses the ramifications of the
orograms as data concept and considers general desirable features o
models of computation. It discusses a recently proposed model, motivatec
ny biology, the ‘blob’ model, and to what extent it meets these ideal
features and how the remaining desiderata could be addressed.

The article by Marion [3] is motivated by applications of Kleene’s seconc
recursion theorem, which is the key mathematical fact expressing the
yower of the program-as-data concept, to modelling computer viruses.
The key features of viruses are self-replication and mutation. The paper
discusses a concrete computational model of these features in the form o
self-modifying register machines.

The article by Dershowitz [4] discusses the classical Turing notion o
universality, with a careful foundational consideration of the constraints
that need to be imposed on the coding of programs and on pairing in
order to avoid ‘cheating’, which would vitiate the analysis of computation,
leading to a notion of ‘honest universality’.
